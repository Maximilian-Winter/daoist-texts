# Chapter 30: Recompensing Past Debts — The Conch Shell Becomes a Daoist Altar;  
Attacking the Adversary — The Clam’s Belly Sets Up a Contest Platform

Now it happened that the two demons Lingxu and Kongkong, bent on assassinating Master Iron Crutch, transformed themselves into mosquito and ant, and proceeded to the palace of the conch. They did not anticipate that their attempt at assassination would fail, and instead Master Iron Crutch, by means of his skill and power, enclosed the two demons within a gourd and captured them. He then compelled them to surrender all the magic treasures which they had painstakingly forged, and after terrifying them for a time until they bled at their kowtows, he withdrew the gourd and drove out the two demons. A celestial wind bore them to the gate of the clam shell. The two demons, opening their eyes, looked about and were at once astonished, joyful, and fearful. For it was that Master Iron Crutch, by his nature most compassionate, having himself escaped their treachery, had taken the opportunity to enlighten them, so that they might deeply repent their past errors and enter the orthodox teaching — which was indeed a great good. Yet the two demons were obstinate and unrepentant; beyond their prayers for mercy, they uttered not a single word to seek salvation. Master Iron Crutch therefore understood that these two creatures were truly without blessed fate, and so he restored them to their original place.

The two demons, relieved beyond measure, could not but hasten to worship and thank Kongkong for his kindness in granting them new life; only then did they, in their disorder and confusion, enter the inner hall. The old dragon and more than ten other demons had waited anxiously, and seeing the two in such plight, were all greatly amazed. Mingmingzi first said: “Behold this condition; clearly they have suffered a great loss.” Tongxuanzi’s heart was still filled with thoughts of his precious soul-capturing bottle, and he hastily inquired: “Brothers have returned; did you find the soul-capturing bottle? Are the two captured demons indeed here? What of their lives and deaths?” Lingxu signalled with his hand and said: “There is no need to speak; today we have indeed suffered a loss such as never before. See, are not our magic treasures all taken from us?” Tongxuanzi then briefly related the foregoing events, so that all present were struck dumb, exchanging looks, and uttering no word. The old dragon angrily said: “Who would have thought that you two would suffer such a loss! That crippled villain is so audacious. I will go and beseech the Lord Master to come here without delay, and must needs cut him off, so as to leave no future trouble.” The demons all rejoiced at the words, praising the old dragon.

Just as they were about to set out, suddenly from outside came the sound of loud celestial music, and the cry of cranes soaring high. The old dragon suspiciously said: “What immortal is this that comes to help them? If indeed so, we truly must invite the Lord Master.” Before he had finished speaking, a little demon at the gate reported: “Two lords and a lady have come to pay their respects, and are waiting at the gate.” The old dragon was greatly pleased, thinking it must be comrades of his own teaching come to assist. So he, with the other demons, went out to meet them. It was none other than the three foremost disciples of the Jie sect, Sun Hu, Niu Bo, and Hu Haishan, and a female immortal of the Bai clan. Hearing that a Daoist altar was being established within the conch shell, and that persons of both sects had gathered there, fearing that their own teaching might suffer loss, they had specially come by the orders of their Lord Master to attend to the matter. The old dragon rejoiced greatly and, along with the demons, respectfully paid homage. Sun Hu inquired about the state of the contest and the date of the altar; the old dragon reported the misfortune of Lingxu and the two other demons, and added: “The altar was originally set for today, but hearing that many comrades had not yet arrived, the date has been postponed for ten days; it is likely that by the twentieth of this month it will surely be established.” Niu Bo, hearing of the misfortunes of Lingxu and the others, was filled with anger and said: “How dare the disciples of Lord Lao insult our teaching! Since we have arrived, tomorrow we will erect a contest platform in the open space ahead, and order them to come one by one to their deaths. If none can defeat the platform, we will break their conch shell, drive that Lady Luo Yuan ashore, and forbid them to remain even for a moment within five hundred li of Hua Hai village. Brothers in the Way, what say you?” 

Sun Hu laughed and said: “Though Iron Crutch has some skill in the Way, these few years of practice cannot have given him great power. Knowing we have come, he will surely seek to invite other masters from the sea for help. We shall send messengers to summon them to the contest, and at the same time we ourselves will watch the critical mountain pass; if this fellow goes out to sea, he must be going to seek reinforcements on the mountain. It will be well to seize him first, and thus avenge our comrades Lingxu and the others.” All the demons were overjoyed and unanimously praised these words. Then within the clam shell there was a grand feast of welcome. Meanwhile, a little demon was dispatched to send a letter beneath the conch shell.

Juexian received the letter, and together with Huitong and Zhang Guo came to see Master Iron Crutch. Taking the letter, the Master smiled and said: “A contest beneath the sea is indeed a strange tale; but alas, many comrades will unavoidably suffer through it — how pitiable and grievous!” The two already perceived the meaning, and nodded without speaking. Huitong asked: “Master, will you send to invite some celestial teachers to aid?” The Master smiled and said: “There is no need to send; our reinforcements are already on the way.” Before long, indeed, the immortals Wenshi, Piaomiao, Guangcheng, Yunzhong, and the immortal Wenmei all arrived together. Iron Crutch and Juexian, with the others, went out to welcome and admit them. Wenshi smiled to Iron Crutch and said: “Our Patriarch has heard that you are skilled in arrangement, and cherish compassion, and so commends you greatly.” Iron Crutch, abashed, said: “Being favoured by the Patriarch moves me to the marrow and I shall never forget. It is especially moving that you, my fellow disciples and senior brothers, have come to assist me. But the Patriarch once ordered in the palace that at a critical moment He Himself will come to offer guidance — I wonder whether this will indeed come to pass?” All the immortals said: “This is your special destiny; to be favoured beyond measure by the Patriarch — who else could equal you?”

Zhang Guo also came to pay respects to the immortal Wenmei. The immortal examined his cultivation, seeing his countenance full of Daoist spirit and his body marked by immortal bones, and was greatly pleased; he nodded and sighed, saying: “The immortal destinies of the two sects are truly beyond explanation. Though your birth was humble, you have the patronage of one such as I; now the storms have passed, you may devote yourself to cultivation. In a few hundred years at most you shall attain the Way; compared with other beings who attain the Way, you already possess good fortune. But when compared to your uncle Iron Crutch, the depth of his blessings and the weight of his immortal destiny cannot be spoken of in the same terms.” All the immortals present sighed at these words. Zhang Guo said: “Your servant only seeks to succeed, not caring for haste or delay; those of shallow destiny and poor fortune will all become immortals, but it may take them a thousand or a hundred years of bitter labour. Since coming to this world and taking up the Way, suffering some hardship is but part of the share. Though I be foolish, I yet will not belittle myself.” The immortal Wenmei, hearing this, could not help but be pleased and said: “That you can so resolve and keep such heart, cultivation of immortality and attainment of Buddhahood will be easy matters and need not be feared.” Wenshi, the immortals and Master Iron Crutch all unanimously praised Zhang Guo, causing him great unease.

Presently Huitong came out to pay respects to Wenmei, explaining his delay as owing to arranging the altar with Juexian and others, and begged his master’s forgiveness. Wenmei laughed and said: “You had important business; it was right for you to complete it before coming to see me. How could I blame you?” Huitong thanked him and sat down with Zhang Guo at the head of the assembly. Wenmei and Wenshi smiled and said to Piaomiao and the immortal Huolong: “Brothers, you have come so far; why are your two chief disciples not here to attend? Moreover, this place should be under the charge of those two, as husband and wife; is it not their duty as hosts?” The two immortals, hearing this, laughed and said: “We came in haste and did not notify the Crystal Palace; they naturally did not know we had arrived. But those two are honest and loyal, and when they hear of our arrival within a day or two, they will surely come to pay respects.”

Before their words were done, suddenly there was the sound of wind and rain outside, followed by the roaring of waves, a great tumult. The immortals did not know the cause; Master Iron Crutch thought it was the clam shell demons making mischief. Mei smiled and said: “I know it must be the disciples of Piaomiao and Huolong.” No sooner had she spoken than a servant girl from the cave led the Dragon King and his consort, who first kowtowed to Piaomiao and Huolong, and the two immortals hastened to greet their elder uncles and fellow disciples. Among them, only Huitong and the Dragon King were well acquainted.

Though Zhang Guo had long been old friends with them from centuries before, he now felt humble and paid his respects to the Dragon King and Queen as elders. After friendly exchanges, the scene was lively and warm. The Dragon King spoke of the new great clam of the South Sea, and seeing the clam shell here converted into a palace, and the contest platform set up inviting demons from all quarters to vex the immortals here, he said: “I had long thought to expel them and forbid their disorder here, but hearing that there are many able men within, and that the Jie sect’s Lord Master Tongtian is to come in person to support his disciples, I find my own powers limited and cannot resist him. Fortunately, many heavenly immortals are here, and the demons shall not be hard to overcome; so for the time being we feign carelessness and see how they trouble us.” Wenshi laughed and said: “Since we have come, we must not be slack. Tomorrow we will all go and see how they have arranged their affairs, and what able men and sages are among them. Knowing this early, we can call upon our brother Li to finish his altar work quickly, so all may return to their heavenly offices, and not be detained long beneath the sea, troubling the Dragon King.” All the immortals smiled and agreed.

The Dragon King and consort, feeling most abashed, said: “Your presence, exalted immortals, is truly a blessing to the sea realm; we, your humble servants, welcome you with difficulty, and how can we speak of troubling you?” The immortal Huolong laughed and said: “Indeed, this place is under your charge, and this hospitality is rightly yours to extend.” The Dragon King rose and, smiling, replied: “Of course. I had wished to invite all you elder brothers to visit the palace, but knowing the altar must be complete, I dare not be negligent. As to all the provisions, they have been fully prepared by the palace and sent by officials.” The immortals all thanked him. Piaomiao laughed aloud: “Brothers, you need not be so courteous. The Dragon King and consort ordinarily enjoy every delicacy in abundance, a fare rare even in heaven; we are lucky to come here and cause them but a little disturbance — what harm is it?” Yunzhongzi and Guangchengzi heard this and laughed: “So you two masters are short-sighted and greedy-tongued, hoping to extort a little from your disciples; but not to involve us all in it!” This caused much laughter among them.

While they talked, the Dragon Palace sent attendants to set up a sumptuous banquet, one place for each immortal. The Dragon King and consort courteously invited each to sit, and personally poured the wine; sitting at the lower place, they accompanied them. The immortals made no ceremony and took their seats. The Dragon King and consort served wine, dishes were deployed in order, fine fruits assorted; the splendour and variety were beyond telling, the hosts urged the guests to drink, and all drank freely and with joy. The feast began in the morning and did not disperse until the afternoon. The Dragon King and consort, having duties, took leave and departed.

Suddenly Wenshi felt a stir in his heart and smiled to Iron Crutch, saying: “Brother, those demons are truly shallow; to prevent you from seeking reinforcements, they have even stationed men in the palace awaiting you. Now we may play their game.” Iron Crutch smiled and asked what was the plan. Wenshi laughed and said: “You are the altar master and cannot leave. Let Wenmei and I transform into the semblance of your master and disciple and be captured by them; on the day of the contest, we will act within to seize the opportunity and destroy them at a stroke — is this not convenient?” The immortals applauded and praised the plan.

Hearing the words ‘master and disciple’, Iron Crutch suddenly remembered an important matter and hastened to say: “I wished to ask you, my elder brothers, about my disciples Feifei and Diandian, who were captured by demons and placed within the soul-capturing bottle. Though the bottle has been taken, we cannot open it. What is to be done?” Wenshi laughed and said: “That must be some treasure of Tongxuanzi; that thing is a cicada, who by chance our senior brother Yunding, the immortal, took pity on for his sincerity and taught some methods. But the cicada was impatient in life and did not understand right and wrong, and came to challenge us here; it seems his fate is likewise short. Show me the bottle and I will study how to open it.” Iron Crutch complied and produced the soul-capturing bottle from his bosom. Wenshi took it in his hand, and all the immortals came to look. Wenshi chanted spells, uttered golden breath, and directed it to the bottle’s mouth; suddenly the mouth split and two souls were restored to their bodies. Inside, Feifei and Diandian cried out “Ah!” and rose, hearing the celestial aid, they hurried forth to give thanks.

Then the immortal Wenmei transformed into the shape of Iron Crutch, and Wenshi transformed into two, becoming Feifei and Diandian. The three rose together amidst the clouds and looked about; indeed, demons guarded all around. Wenmei and Wenshi fought bravely, but soon their strength waned and they were captured. The demons rejoiced and crowded the three back into the clam shell. The two immortals, looking afar, saw purple clouds faintly surrounding the clam shell, and were alarmed, saying: “The Lord Master Tongtian has come. How shall our transformation art hide from his eyes? Let us hope we do not overreach ourselves.” Before their words were done, they were pressed into the clam palace. Though at this time the two immortals might have escaped, wanting to learn the news within, they entered for the present. Pushed and shoved by demons, they came to the second large courtyard. There was a contest platform set up, upon which many demon immortals were gathered — of all sorts, fair and foul, diverse in beauty and ugliness. In the centre sat an old Daoist, white-haired, white-bearded, with broad nose and long ears. The two immortals recognized him as the Lord Master Tongtian, but knew not when he had arrived. While pondering escape, they saw Tongtian slightly open his eyes and smile to several chief disciples on either side, saying: “See how ignorant the disciples of my sect are! Knowing I am here, they still dare to come with their transformation arts to try me.” The disciples asked: “Are not these three things Iron Crutch and his disciples?” Tongtian sneered and said: “Bring up these foolish boys; they can transform and use the five evasions. Put my talisman on their heads, and they will be unable to escape.” The chief disciples Sun Hu and Niu Bo took down the talisman from the platform. Wenmei winked to Wenshi, who understood and said: “Let us go.” With a sudden stamp of their feet, they used earth evasion to escape from the clam shell and returned to their own camp, leaving Tongtian and his disciples enraged.

The next day, Wenshi, Wenmei, Piaomiao, Huolong, Guangchengzi, Yunzhongzi, Master Iron Crutch and disciples, Huitong, Zhang Guo, Juexian, and more than ten immortals went to the clam shell. Tongtian Lord Master still sat high on the platform as on the previous day, unmoving. Wenshi called out loudly: “Uncle Tongtian, though our teachings and yours are not the same path, we are all outsiders with the Way. Our comrade Juexian, owing to heavy sins in a former life, now teaches for a few days at the altar to liberate resentful spirits — a matter well in accord with reason. We know not how he has offended you, that you should come in person, as if to face a great enemy. What is the cause of this?” Tongtian made no answer; nearby stepped forth Niu Bo and Sun Hai, who shouted: “Wenshi, Wenmei, do not speak nonsense! Since you know we are all cultivators outside the world, you should respect and befriend each other. How is it that you all speak ill of our teaching outside, saying we are not human? Are all Wenmei’s disciples humans? Know that Heaven cherishes life; all persons are equal according to their cultivation, none may insult another by birth. Our teaching is broad and does not quarrel with you. But that little demon Luo Yuan does not measure himself, and means to quarrel with Brother Jiao. Brother Jiao was once his son, but many a thousand years have passed and many generations changed; why persist in such old grudges? Therefore our Patriarch, moved by great mercy, has come to aid him. If you are wise, return to your own mountain, surrender the snail maid to us, and end this matter; otherwise, beware that your present joy will bring you death before you return.”

Wenshi and Wenmei laughed and said: “From what you say, it seems because we do not treat you as humans, old grudges arise. By chance that old dragon came to complain, and you seized the opportunity to come for revenge. Be that as it may, whether your reports be true or not, as for the old dragon, his many rebellions and misdeeds are such that even if he did not seek us, we would be compelled to seek him to remove a scourge from the people. But he has come to us on his own. Know that his time is come; his thousands of years of cultivation will vanish as naught. Comrades like you coming from afar to assist him in such rebellion truly know not the Way of Heaven nor understand its great meaning; we pity you for this!” Hearing this, Niu Bo and the others grew furious.

How Niu Bo and the others further showed their anger will be revealed in the next chapter.
