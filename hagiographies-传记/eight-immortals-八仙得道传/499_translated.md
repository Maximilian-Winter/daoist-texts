# Chapter 31: The Contest of Magic in the Clam Palace, The Gourd Conceals the Immortal

It is said that within the clam shell a fighting arena was established, and the Patriarch of the Tongtian Sect issued orders. Seeing that Niu Bo and the other immortals here could not outtalk those on the other side, he said: "Who has such great skill to contend with them in words? Now we set up this arena; let them come up and compete in a contest of skill. If they can surpass us, we will lower our flags, cease hostilities, and return to our mountain; but if not, then as I have said before, those snails and bats shall not be permitted to display their martial airs here. Each one must be driven beyond the heavens, never again to return to the Central Lands." Having spoken thus, the Patriarch descended from the stage.

Here, Lingxu, Tongxuan, and Kongkong, the three sons, having lost their treasures, could no longer display their majesty. Only Mingmingzi remained unconvinced and wished to avenge his three fellow Daoists. He first ascended the stage and loudly cried: "Which one of the sect will come forth and measure skill with this poor Daoist?" Before a word was finished, the female immortal Huitong leapt up, exchanged names, each grasping a treasured sword, and they fought on the stage for a time, without determining a victor.

Mingmingzi secretly released a treasure from his hand, then turned to flee. As Huitong pursued, he suddenly shouted fiercely: "Wicked woman, behold the treasure of the Patriarch!" Looking up, Huitong saw a red light from Mingmingzi's hand striking directly at her forehead. Mingmingzi had been transformed from a firefly, and the red light he emitted was his own fire; a mortal encountering it would be scorched utterly in a moment. Huitong, being forewarned, produced from her sleeve a treasured fan and fanned back the fire thrice against its advance. Though the fire could not burn Mingmingzi himself, it could not cross over to her side. Huitong laughed and said: "You little insect, truly the light of a firefly, yet you dare to come out and frighten people? Behold your Ancestress Granny’s fire!" Having spoken, she spat forth a pill and hurled it at Mingmingzi; it was a fox-bodied pill. Upon touching Mingmingzi, suddenly his whole body caught fire, fierce flames filled the stage, burning Mingmingzi to his original form—it was a monstrous mosquito. From the midst of the fiery sparks he fluttered down from the stage, burnt head and wings battered, bones broken, staggering and retreating to his own ranks, barely alive.

The old flood-dragon, seeing Mingmingzi so shamefully defeated, was greatly angered. Immediately he spewed forth fire and ascended, but lightly spat once, and the whole stage was submerged in a vast ocean. Huitong was terrified and fled in disorder back to her ranks. At this time, the Real Person Wenmei’s soul went to the Dragon Palace, urging the Dragon King and Queen to quickly withdraw the sea water, forbidding demons to borrow it. The Dragon King reported: "That old flood-dragon is indeed a practitioner of evil arts, but his nature belongs to water. Though he uses all his power to overturn the rivers and seas, it is not by our permission that he borrows it." Wenmei could do nothing and returned to the clam shell.

Fortunately, Master Tieguai arrived soon after and asked the cause. Meanwhile, the water surged ever more strongly toward this side. Luckily, each immortal possessed means to avoid water; as it reached them, it parted around without causing the slightest harm. Tieguai smiled and said: "This must be met by my gourd, to hold a single cup of this water." Hastily opening his gourd, he uttered incantations, and the raging flood turned wholly into the gourd. The old flood-dragon, enraged, summoned all the waters of the Southern Sea to drown the immortals. But the greater the flood, the faster it flowed into the gourd; outside the gourd not a drop of water was visible. Then Wen began to shout loudly: "O you wretched beast, heedless of your life, if you drain a sea, do you not harm all those living beings therein? Do you not fear to offend the heavenly laws, to be struck by fire and thunder?" The old flood-dragon was suddenly alarmed; seeing that the great water harmed not his foes, he had no choice but to recite a retreating water spell and stop the flood. Master Tieguai raised his gourd and laughed upon the stage: "Though you withdraw the water, do you know that the water there is but a few inches deep? Still, it cannot escape troubling the living." The flood-dragon was speechless, and sullenly left the stage.

Then Sun Hu stood before the stage and called aloud: "Who will contend once with this poor Daoist in play?" Guangchengzi smiled and said to Yunzhongzi: "This Sun Hu is a tiger demon. He carries a string of skull beads; when shaken in the wind, the souls and spirits of the weak-hearted shatter. Brother Dao, you have the Steady Spirit bead to counter him. Yet this fiend’s swordsmanship and martial skill are excellent; when you engage, guard yourself well." Yunzhongzi took up his sword and ascended the stage; they exchanged names, and vigorously fought. Though Yunzhongzi was a man of profound Dao, facing Sun Hu’s twin hammers he felt some strength in them and could not help but laugh: "After all, he is a fierce tiger, with some spirit in his blows." Sun Hu heard and was enraged; wielding his twin hammers he beat upon Yunzhongzi’s body fiercely. Yunzhongzi was agile and quick; not a blow touched him. The crowd below plainly saw Sun Hu’s hammers strike Yunzhongzi, yet Yunzhongzi was unharmed. Suddenly he moved behind Sun Hu, then flashed past his back, so that Sun Hu’s strength was wasted, and he was so vexed that sweat poured from his face.

Suddenly Sun Hu drew forth a string of skulls, numbering seventy or eighty, all the people he had devoured, refined into this treasure. Facing Yunzhongzi, they rattled and shook. Even Yunzhongzi, great in magic power, shivered, though prepared, holding the Steady Spirit bead to ward off the skulls. Sun Hu opened his eyes wide and saw the bead shining, about one zhang in size, in its light appearing many fierce ghosts, each with dishevelled hair and faces stained with blood, shapes most frightful. These were the true forms of the skulls; they snarled and snarled and sprang at Sun Hu, who cried aloud and fell to the ground in terror.

Guangchengzi called out from below: "Brother Yunzhong, act quickly; this beast has devoured the most people, his evil is full; do not take him lightly!" Before the words were finished, Yunzhongzi’s sword pierced Sun Hu’s lower belly; a tiger’s roar like earth-shattering thunder was heard, and Sun Hu died an untimely death. On the stage lay a dead tiger, one forepaw still clutching his dreadful treasure of skulls. Yunzhongzi raised his sword to step down, when suddenly from behind came a furious shout: "Thief Daoist, do not flee; contend with me once!" Yunzhongzi turned and saw a monster with the head of a bull, face of a horse, dragon’s body, tiger’s tail; it was the mount of the Patriarch Tongtian, the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid, clutching a gilded shield and striking at Yunzhongzi’s head and face. Seeing the beast so foul and coming on so fiercely, Yunzhongzi retreated three steps and laughed: "How unlucky, in broad daylight to see such a monster! Do you not look in a mirror? You cannot even make yourself into a proper beast, much less a man, and yet you dare to show yourself before men?" These words angered the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid; with a roar he emitted two columns of smoke from his nostrils, foul as dung, rank as serpents. Yunzhongzi was disgusted; standing at the side of the stage, he involuntarily fell off, but Guangchengzi caught him.

Real Person Wenshi frowned and said: "Cultivators fear nothing but filth and evil. This creature is so foul and rank, who can endure it? To drown or burn it with water and fire is feared: the stench would grow worse, and as it is part dragon, it might thereby gain mastery of the water. What method can we use to deal with it?" Real Person Wenmei laughed: "Brother Dao, why fear such a monster? Would you not make people laugh?" Wenshi said: "It is not fear, but such lowly creatures are unworthy to taint the body of an immortal with their stench! Have you not seen Brother Yunzhong already suffer loss at its hands?" Wenmei considered and said: "I see. What we fear is its stench; stinking things do not bear the presence of fragrant air. Senior Brother Tieguai’s gourd contains a potent lily fragrance made by the Patriarch himself; let us try it on this monster." Wenshi agreed, and invited Master Tieguai to the stage. Tieguai, staff in one hand and gourd in the other, limped and hobbled onto the arena. The Dragon-Tiger Hybrid, unaware of his own pitiable ugliness, laughed at Tieguai’s appearance. Tieguai paid no heed, opened the gourd lid, and chanted; immediately a strong fragrance spread afar. The Dragon-Tiger Hybrid, unprepared for anything that could counter his stench, became dazed and fainted on the stage. Because this was his own mount, the Patriarch Tongtian hastily cast talismans and summoned many divine generals to guard the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid. Tieguai angrily said: "The Jie Sect is a path of demons and devils; why do you divine generals obey his orders?" The generals transformed and replied: "Not to conceal from the Master, we only obey talismans and spells, caring not for the person. Since it is the Master’s command, surely no error is possible; we take our leave." Tieguai thanked them repeatedly, and they all departed.

Tieguai, suspecting the Patriarch Tongtian might employ other tricks, did not wait for the generals to ascend, but hastily severed the Dragon-Tiger Hybrid in two with a sword. Green blood spurted forth, the stench far worse than before. Tieguai had prepared, and with the flying sword he swiftly escaped down from the stage. Yet the sword itself, having been sullied by the foulness, though it had achieved its purpose, hovered on the stage and could not descend. At that moment, the one-horned great lion holding a blade ascended. Unprepared, half its horn was severed by the sword’s flash. The immortals below laughed and said: "Henceforth the one-horned lion has but half a horn, becoming the half-horned great lion." The lion was both angry and furious; seeing the sword still flying, it raised itself high and wielded its treasured blade. As the flying sword approached, a sharp clash rang out; sparks flew about the stage. Luckily, Tieguai again intoned a spell and retrieved the sword. He saw the sword’s sullied part as though rusty, emitting a lingering stench which made him nauseous. He angrily said: "This will cost me several days’ time to cleanse and repair." The immortals laughed: "You have but suffered a slight loss; the monster’s life is surely in your hands, and its master, having lost his mount, will be greatly vexed."

Before the words ended, the Patriarch Tongtian and the one-horned great lion appeared together at the stage entrance. The Patriarch, furious, cried: "Thieving demons, how dare you be so rude as to damage my mount! I once considered you fellow cultivators and wished to spare your lives, but since you act so recklessly, do not blame me for dealing death to you!" As he spoke, without delay, he spread wide both hands, forming a great net, chanting incantations, and suddenly shouted "Swift!"

In an instant, the sky darkened, and the earth dimmed; not a spark of light remained. This was the Patriarch’s fiercest and deadliest magic, called the "Execution Immortal Net." Raising both hands, he shaped it like a vast net. Though invisible and insubstantial, whichever immortal or demon entered it could not step beyond its bounds. Chinese history relates that King Wen of Zhou created a prison by drawing lines on the ground, which was much like this, but such a prison could only confine criminals, not bring them to death. The Execution Immortal Net was far more terrible; those caught felt needles and cords binding them all over, tightening and piercing ever more painfully; no matter how fierce the struggle, within twelve hours all would be dissolved into blood and water. The Patriarch locked the immortals within the net and, fearing that there might be experts among them, to prevent escape, commanded the clam demon to sew up the shell and affix the Patriarch’s talisman, forbidding their flight. Fearing Laozi himself might come to rescue, he stationed several senior disciples outside the clam shell in the clouds, waiting. After twelve hours, when all the immortals should be dissolved into blood and water, he would count it a complete victory, smash the snail shells, drive away Luo Yuan and the others, and return without ceremony to the Cloud Peak Ridge in the southern heavens.

Turning from the Patriarch’s side, we return to the immortals trapped within the Execution Immortal Net. Real Persons Wenshi and the other three could not guess the magic the Patriarch used. They tried various methods to escape this strange net, but it was not a real object; it was wholly formed from the Patriarch’s own sinews, existing when he willed, vanishing when he willed. The more insubstantial it was, the more impervious to destruction, leaving the immortals at their wits’ end. After some time, all felt as if bound by cords, then as if the whole body was pierced by needles. The deeply cultivated immortals felt little; but Huitong, Zhang Guo, Diandian, Feifei, and several others were wracked with pain, crying and wailing, wishing for death. The immortals grew increasingly anxious. Suddenly Tieguai recalled Laozi’s words and loudly advised many Dao friends to endure the suffering patiently, not to show weakness to the enemy, for the Patriarch had long foreseen this tribulation and promised to come personally to rescue; soon he would arrive, and patience must be maintained. Huitong and the others wept: "Uncle Master’s cultivation is profound, he cannot feel such pain, but he does not understand how much we suffer!"

Hearing this, Tieguai was filled with shame and anxiety, in difficulty, when suddenly Real Person Wenmei spoke: "Senior Brother Tieguai, your gourd contains another world, a place of refuge; why not try bringing it here? That treasure was personally forged by the Patriarch; no matter how fierce the demon magic, it surely cannot enter therein." The immortals rejoiced: "Perfect, excellent! Bring it out quickly for use." Tieguai hurriedly removed the gourd lid; a ray of light shone forth from the gourd’s mouth. All eagerly entered the light; though the number was not large, all were inside in a moment. They felt the place grew ever brighter and larger as they advanced to an inner chamber well furnished with implements, with fields, houses, mountains, and rivers all complete. They dwelt in three thatched huts, truly as comfortable as outside, yet they did not know if they could escape the gourd. After some deliberation, Tieguai declared: "This place can only serve as a temporary refuge; once outside the gourd, they will be caught again in the Patriarch Tongtian’s net. How can one escape?" Hearing this, the immortals greatly despaired. Fortunately, the wounded, once inside the gourd, were freed from the pain of needles and cords, and all their wounds healed completely, no different than their usual state. This comforted them somewhat, and they resolved to await Laozi’s rescue.

After some unknown time, they heard voices outside. Listening closely, it seemed the Patriarch Tongtian’s voice, speaking in strange tones: "My great magic has never failed; I have slain many demons, even the Golden Immortals of the caves fear me. How is it that after all this time, there is no sign of blood and water? Moreover, how is it that these creatures are all gone? What meaning is this?" Soon another voice said: "Patriarch, see, this gourd belongs to the lame thief demon; it may conceal thousands. Could these rogue Daoists all have hidden themselves inside?" Then the Patriarch said: "That is to be feared; but in any case, they cannot escape outside the gourd. I shall burn the gourd with the Samadhi True Fire and see what methods they have then!"

Hearing this, the immortals inside laughed heartily. Tieguai smiled and said: "He would burn my gourd? Truly foolish beyond measure! Is my gourd made by some rustic farmer, so as to be burned or cut? If it were so, what use would its many functions be?" Huitong laughingly asked: "If a fire is lit outside, will not the climate inside grow somewhat hot?" Zhang Guo laughed: "What harm? The climate here is cold; with its fire stove, is it not comfortable and amusing?" The immortals laughed uproariously. Outside they heard: "Listen, the gourd contains voices; these wretches truly hide inside!" The immortals inside laughed and said: "Truly a tiresome matter! They have become demons within the clam, while we have become immortals within the gourd. So contending, who knows whether the clam shell will be broken by the gourd, or the gourd crushed by the clam shell!"

What witty words the demons outside spoke remains to be told in the next chapter.
