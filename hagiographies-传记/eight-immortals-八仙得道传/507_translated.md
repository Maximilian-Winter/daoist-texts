# Chapter XXXIX: The Wine Jar that Could Contain Tieguai; The Gourd that Silenced the Immortal Maiden

It is said that Zhongli Quan spoke to the Immortal Maiden, saying that his grandmother was older than his father; he could not help but smile, and said, “Child, you speak as a child would; naturally a grandmother is older than a father, just as you are younger than your father. Is this not plain?” Zhongli Quan also laughed, and said, “My elder sister is called Eldest Miss; she is this year twelve years old, while I am but nine. I have also an elder brother, who, my father says, was carried off by a tiger; hence my father bears a great hatred towards the tiger and leopard. Ten years ago he was a fine strong man; many wild beasts of the mountains died by his hand. After my sister and I were born, he taught us all his skill. But two years ago, having gone to a certain place, he was surrounded by many tigers and leopards, and fought them through the night; though he preserved his life, he exhausted all his strength. At dawn, some one found him lying on the ground, foam at his mouth, body soft and faint, unable to govern himself; but still able to speak, he begged to be carried home. From that time onward he could no longer enter the mountain, nor contend with wild beasts.”

The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, could not but nod and sigh, saying, “Child, behold your father, so heroic and talented, yet for the sake of showing his own strength, he slew beasts of the forest, and in the end was himself wounded by them, becoming maimed. Thus it appears that in this world, such strength as man has is best not employed to harm men or animals; better to reserve it for some useful purpose for the world, or to guard one’s own self — this is the proper way.” The child said, “Sister, your words are true. My father at first longed to send my sister and me into the mountains to kill all the tigers and leopards; afterwards when he fell ill, he was less willing to teach us such matters. His words are just as you have spoken. I believe my father’s teaching, and so also I believe that what you have taught me is good.” The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, was the more pleased, and said, “The time is late; your family must be waiting for your return to dinner. Bring me with you quickly. I will teach you the method to subdue tigers, leopards, and wolves, so that henceforth you may be less troubled by beasts, and lives be spared. Moreover, this method is not only for overcoming beasts; should you meet evil men who seek to behave tyrannically or harm your place, or oppose you, you need not fight them; merely by silently repeating an incantation, you can render your adversary powerless to resist. Child, do you think this method good?”

The child, hearing this, was so joyful that he danced and shouted several times, “Good sister, you truly are my good teacher. My father and grandmother say they will engage a skilled teacher for me; who would have thought that today I should meet one? Teacher, please lead on, and we will return together. As for this leopard, though it is lost to me, I am somewhat loath; teacher, use your magic to call it back, and hear what my father says about it.” The Immortal Maiden, wishing to subdue Zhongli Quan and bring him out of the world, could not thwart the child’s wishes, lest she lose the favour of the little one; so she smiled and said, “Go on, I will take it with us.” Then with a wave of her hand, the leopard leapt up, lowering its head and flattening its ears, and followed the two as they walked beyond the mountain.

Zhongli Quan pointed with his finger, saying, “There is a great bamboo grove ahead; behind the grove stand two large camphor trees; along the riverbank is the house where we live.” The Immortal Maiden, following the direction of his little hand, looked afar; but before she could make out the house, she perceived a strange sight. Before the bamboo grove, facing the way the two were coming, there was a wine jar, small in mouth but large in belly, moving on its own, mouth upwards and base downwards, staggering towards the Immortal Maiden and party from afar. The Immortal Maiden was greatly alarmed, and said, “Child, look, what is that? How can it move alone, and yet no feet be seen? What is the reason?”

Zhongli Quan glanced and laughed, saying, “Oh, that thing — it is a man. Teacher, you did not see it at first, but a man’s head is sticking out from the mouth of the jar. This man, though he be reckoned the strangest in the capital, how is it that you do not know him?”

At this the Immortal Maiden also saw the human head protruding from the jar’s mouth, and was greatly perplexed; she asked the child, “Do you know whence this strange man is, and how long he hath dwelt here?” The child said, “This man has no home or hearth; he lives in this jar. Sometimes he leaves the jar on the road, and goes out; oftentimes he will be gone for two or three days. Sometimes he carries the jar as he walks, as if man and jar were joined inseparably. Teacher, you have just seen him carrying the jar. This man does not speak much with ordinary folk, nor does he go to market or home to eat. The jar’s mouth is small and his body large; we do not know how he gets in and out without hindrance. He does not give his name, and no one knows him; only that he is a black, stiff-legged lame man, who always leans on an iron crutch; he calls himself Master Iron Crutch, and others call him so too. Teacher, tell me, what is Master Iron Crutch’s true name?”

The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, considered for a while. Seeing Iron Crutch approaching, she hurried to meet Zhongli and bowed to the black head at the jar’s mouth, greeting, “Master, whence do you come, and whither go you? Poor Daoist—”

But ere she could finish the word “what,” Master Iron Crutch nodded thrice with his black head at the jar’s mouth; the head touched the jar with a sound like “hong,” causing Zhongli to burst into loud laughter. Iron Crutch first said to the Immortal Maiden, “Do not speak, for if I do, it will be too much. You think I and you have not two eyes alike? And yet you do not recognize even your old companion of two generations!” The Immortal Maiden was amazed and did not understand his meaning. Iron Crutch then smiled at Zhongli, and said, “Child, why do you laugh? I tell you, it is not that this jar cannot bear my nods; except for my iron head, no other could cause such a sound from the jar.” Zhongli, hearing this, opened his little eyes wide and round, and stared at Iron Crutch in astonishment. Iron Crutch laughed and said, “Do not be confused or afraid; use your strength in tiger-hunting, and knock thrice on this jar; see if a sound is made!”

Zhongli, seeing the matter so strange, hesitated and dared not move at once. Iron Crutch laughed at the Immortal Maiden, saying, “Look at you! This noble disciple of yours takes heed after only a few admonitions from you.” The Immortal Maiden and Zhongli, hearing this, were the more amazed. The Immortal Maiden bowed deeply, saying, “I know you are a Golden Immortal of Heaven come to sport in the world; I, a poor Daoist, have long been ashamed of my small attainments, and have sought to return to the true Way; but lost in the vast human sea, have not met the right teacher. Now meeting you, I am sure to be instructed; truly a great good fortune of three lives.” Iron Crutch laughed before she finished, saying, “You are very courteous, but I trouble you greatly. Since you would have me just, how is it that you have taken my disciple from me?” The Immortal Maiden was puzzled, and quickly asked, “Master, how do you mean? This is our first meeting; how can you say I have taken your disciple?”

Iron Crutch laughed and said, “That child is called Zhongli Quan; is he not my disciple? Though you have affinity with him, how can you compare with me, who was sent by the Ancestor of Life to protect and instruct him? How can you at first meeting dare to accept him as your disciple?”

The Immortal Maiden, seeing that he knew all beforehand, was the more convinced that he was a true immortal; she hastened to bow again, and said, “Master, you wrong your servant. Your cultivation is so profound, how should you not understand that the talk of master and disciple comes from a child’s mouth? I did not dare to consent to him; but seeing his great strength, and that he is but a child, I was somewhat amazed, and thought he might be trained. When he gave in and showed respect, I loved him the more, and wished to follow him home to teach him some magic. This is a small matter; my private wish is to guide him into the Way, lest his fine nature be confused by worldly desires; and if he enter the true path, he may later seek a famous master to teach the great Way, and easily be made an immortal. Such is my humble heart. You, being so wise and immortal, surely understand this. Now having met you, it is also this child’s good fortune; not only he, but I also would wish to enter your gate, and follow your immortal carriage, that we may soon attain right enlightenment, and escape the common world. This is my greatest joy.” Saying this, she bowed again.

Iron Crutch had not replied, when Zhongli Quan, being but a child, quickly seized the Immortal Maiden, saying, “Master, delay your salutation; let us bring this honored teacher to our home. If his magic be indeed greater than yours, we will both worship him as master; if not, I will still worship you, and learn some skill, that I be not deluded by others.” The Immortal Maiden hastily scolded, “Do not speak nonsense! This master is truly an immortal; how do you see otherwise?” Iron Crutch laughed heartily, saying, “Ah, this child has forgotten his original face. Well, well, since you say so, if I do not show you some little skill, and you become my disciple, you will not be convinced, but think me a mere cripple, and treat me with disdain. If you have such doubts, you will never make progress in cultivation. Come, come, see here, have we not arrived at your home?” The Immortal Maiden and Zhongli, hearing this, were greatly astonished, and opened their eyes wide. Lo, it was a strange thing — they were not only at Zhongli’s home, but already within his main hall.

Zhongli’s father, Lao Jun, and his elder sister Eldest Miss sat at the lower end, talking of household matters; seeing the three suddenly enter, they were both startled to rise. The Immortal Maiden was greatly suspicious that this Iron Crutch Master was none other than Fei Changfang, who yesterday had sent her to the Zhao family, using the earth-shrinking method. As for Zhongli Quan, though young, his heart was clear; he already knew that this was a thing indeed a celestial magic, far beyond the Immortal Maiden’s skill in subduing beasts. His heart brightened, and he knelt, repeatedly knocking his head, saying aloud, “Master above, your disciple Zhongli Quan pays respects. I spoke foolishly before, and offended you; please pardon me.” Iron Crutch laughed heartily. The Immortal Maiden also was very pleased, and wished to worship him as master, to pay homage. Iron Crutch quickly stopped her, laughing, “No, no, I am not your master. You have your own Xuan-nü as master, who is a hundredfold stronger than I; why seek another? Moreover, you and I are old friends of two lives; only our times of cultivation differ, and the depth of our attainments is somewhat apart; yet in the end we shall both succeed alike. Now that we meet here, it is like meeting an old friend in a strange land. What teaching I have, I will speak freely; how dare I take the place of master?” The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, was still perplexed, and asked, “I cannot recall where I have met you before. I think my memory is not bad, and dare not falsely say I have worshipped the Golden Face; please, immortal, show me.” 

Iron Crutch smiled and shook his head, saying, “You only look upon men’s faces, which is learning of the form; how can you understand the spirit? Not seeing but knowing, changing form and discerning — this is lack of your skill, and no wonder. Just now you thought the person who aided you yesterday was I in disguise; this shows your mind is keen, but it is utterly not so. You must know the person you saw yesterday was one I recently tried to save but failed; his family name is Fei, given name Changfang. The Daoist Fei Master I spoke of yesterday is this man. Why then do you suspect me?” The Immortal Maiden, seeing her thoughts guessed aright, felt her cheeks flush, and her respect increase; but since he said all things in advance and said he cannot be master, she had reason to wait for him to tell of their former meeting before deciding further. Unexpectedly, Iron Crutch said no more, but turned to greet Lao Jun and his daughter. 

By this time Lao Jun had already heard from his son the foregoing matters; he had long heard of the strange man newly arrived in the capital. Now Iron Crutch, with such magic, was willing to take his son as disciple; how could he refuse? He took his daughter’s shoulder, wishing to kneel and thank him. Iron Crutch laughed heartily, saying, “Since your son is my disciple, you are my fellow townsfolk. A townsman must only pay dues and offer gifts; kneeling in great ceremony is not to be thought of. Please be seated. I have more to say to your son.” Lao Jun thanked him repeatedly, and sat down again with his children. Iron Crutch said, “You, being so old, yet walk no better than a child—are you not ashamed?” This caused a general laughter. Zhongli Quan then told again the story of his father’s injury by beasts. Iron Crutch laughed, saying, “I do not believe it. Who in the world is really wounded by beasts? I think his ailment is feigned.” Zhongli, seeing him so jocular, also laughed, saying, “Father, the master says your sickness is feigned! Sister, help father up, and let the master judge the truth of his illness.” Eldest Miss complied, and helped raise their father; but halfway up she found his body light as air. Having used strength, she stumbled and nearly fell, but Lao Jun stretched out a hand to catch her; this pull required but little effort, yet it lifted her body as if a chick, and Lao Jun himself felt all pain depart, his strength restored. 

All were amazed, and Lao Jun understood that Iron Crutch had healed him. He straightened himself, regaining the heroic spirit of ten years past, and loudly said, “I, an old man, out of deep love for my children, resolved to kill all the tigers and leopards near the mountain; but, harming too much, I myself was repaid, and though not aged, became maimed. For ten years my body has been numb; pain beyond words is but slight; what grieves me most is that Heaven gave me strength not to help the world, but to become maimed. Though tigers and leopards are harmful, and should be driven off, Heaven creates all things with reason. If Heaven creates them, why should I kill them to death? Moreover, I have killed too many; this is not the heart of a good man. Whenever I think of this, I feel I have wasted Heaven’s gift of talent, and my conscience weighs heavier than bodily pain tenfold. Now, happily, the Immortal has come down to aid me; ten years of deep illness are suddenly healed. It may be that Heaven, though displeased at my many faults, sees my heart is not evil, and that now my punishment is fulfilled. Hence, using the Immortal’s hand, my health is restored. Henceforth, the years I live are Heaven’s special gift, wrought by the Immortal’s hand. The Immortal will not accept thanks; I can but cling to my children’s arms and strive to do good, that I may repay Heaven, and wish the Immortal an immortal life without end.” 

Having spoken, he commanded Quan, “Quick, you and your sister bow to the Immortal and thank him.” The two obeyed, and knelt to Iron Crutch, who accepted their salutations. Then laughing, he said to Lao Jun, “Since your son is enrolled under my teaching, I must teach him some skill, that he not lose his service. As for this Immortal Maiden, she and I are old friends of two lives; having met by chance, we shall stay a while. Please, old hero, prepare two clean rooms for us: one for the Immortal Maiden to rest, and one for my disciple and me to teach. As for myself, this jar is enough for me to sleep and rise for life; I need no further toil.” Lao Jun had no words but to assent, and at once went to prepare the rooms. He added, “Master, dwelling in a jar, is it not too hard? Why not come out and take a walk?” Iron Crutch laughed, “Old hero, do you think this jar is too small a place? Let me be a humble host, and invite you all to visit my humble abode.” As he spoke, he stepped out of the jar’s mouth, waved to them, and said, “Pray come.” The Immortal Maiden, without hesitation, went to the jar’s mouth; Lao Jun and the others, at first doubtful, and seeing the Immortal Maiden enter, disappeared in a moment. They summoned courage and stepped forward to look in at the jar’s mouth. Iron Crutch raised a sleeve to cover their eyes, and they felt a momentary darkness; they had entered the jar, and saw within a different world, serene and spacious, unlike the world outside. Ahead, the Immortal Maiden and Iron Crutch stood together, beckoning to them.

The three hastened forward, and saw a great leopard lying across the path; all were startled. Zhongli Quan was greatly amazed, for he recognized this leopard as the one he had subdued, which the Immortal Maiden had brought home by magic. Since following Iron Crutch home, he had not yet had time to inquire about the leopard; he had wondered if Iron Crutch had not brought it back, and left it on the road; how came it to be already in his jar? He whispered this to his father. Lao Jun said, “No need for more words! That is the Immortal’s magic, which can change paths near and far, seize the power of heaven and earth. What are such small matters?” Zhongli dared not speak further. As they talked, they reached the side of the Immortal Maiden and Iron Crutch.

Iron Crutch laughed, and asked Zhongli Quan, “Do you see your leopard? Do not underestimate this beast; it has some old ties with you.” Before the sentence ended, not only the father and sons were puzzled, but the Immortal Maiden also was bewildered.

How Zhongli Quan and the beast had old ties, we shall see in the next chapter.
