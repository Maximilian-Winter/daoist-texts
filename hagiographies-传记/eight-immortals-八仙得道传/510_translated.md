# Chapter XLII. Chung-li Encounters the Divine Beast, the Sovereign Finds a Worthy Disciple

Now it befell that Chung-li Ch’üan was, with great care and caution, on his watch; little did he expect that something would silently attack him from behind. Before he could cast a stone to resist, it had gently lifted him up, and with thunder and lightning, soared aloft into the sky. In a moment he was borne amidst clouds and mists. Chung-li Ch’üan was somewhat alarmed, yet he was of a stubborn temper not to shed tears; the more he was in peril, the more he strove to maintain an air of composure and ease. Moreover, he had recently received a celestial master as teacher, and seeing his master float in clouds and mist with perfect freedom, he greatly envied it. His only hope in his cautious heart was to learn this art of soaring on clouds; even the method of shrinking the earth beneath the feet seemed slow and unfit to him. This thought had long been held, and little did he imagine that, in this hour of danger, he would first be taught to taste the flavour of cloud-soaring.

This Chung-li Ch’üan was indeed a playful spirit. Straightway he turned a thought within, thinking: ‘This journey is fraught with peril and little chance of success; my life is likely to be offered up to the beast’s maw. Yet it is well that it has this art of soaring on clouds; before my body perishes, I may well enjoy the flavour of flight through the air.’ So he thought again: ‘I fear the route is too short, and soon I shall come to the beast’s den. I will tap twice upon its head, and say: “Good friend, I know you delight much in me; I will risk offering my body to you as a little morsel. You need not fear my flight to the far heavens; why fly so swiftly? Let us move more slowly, so that I may also enjoy the scenery of the skies. You too will not be so greatly wearied; both will find advantage. Is it not so?”’

As he spoke thus, he well knew it was idle talk; yet he spoke, while anxiously surveying the scene all about him. Above, the height was beyond sight; around him the clouds and mists were thick; in many places he saw what seemed like pavilions, kiosks, flying springs, and strange trees. In his heart he thought these were the mansions of the gods. Now he no longer yearned after them. Seeing this, he prepared to look down upon the lower world, and just as he finished speaking to the beast his request, he felt the beast seemed to understand his meaning, and consented to his request, immediately moderating their flight to be slow and steady.

Chung-li Ch’üan was amazed and pleased; he could not help but laugh, saying: ‘No wonder my grandmother often said, “My fate is to meet with misfortune and turn it to good; when in danger, some good person will assist.” As it now appears, not only good men aid me, but even demons, ghosts, and beasts have dealings with me!’ At this he steadied his mind, caressed the beast’s neck-hair, and thanked it for its favour; then with composure looked down upon the world below. Passing over a thousand li of red earth, no grass grew; in other places, populous towns and flourishing woods; there were lofty mountains, and deep, long rivers. For a while he seemed to be passing over a great sea, seeing above the sky, below the water; sky and water reflecting each other, no line of separation discernible; he seemed enclosed in a great round vessel, as if his body were contained therein. Where the sea breeze rose, the sinking sunset and the newly risen pale moon, one red, the other white, were reflected beneath the waves, stirred by the heaving billows; they revolved like wheels, over and over again. Truly a grand spectacle of heaven and earth, a scene beyond the world.

Chung-li Ch’üan gazed entranced; his childlike temper revived, he sat upon the beast’s back, waving hands and stamping feet, shouting aloud, utterly forgetting his own peril and the hardships of the journey. According to his desire, he wished to converse further with the beast, to play here for ten days or a fortnight, then offer his body to satisfy its favour, dying without complaint. But the beast had no great patience; seeing him so wild and frolicsome, it suddenly grew angry. Its hoof tightened; it sprang upward into the gloom, and Chung-li Ch’üan felt the cold, and saw naught but dense smoke and mist; not only was the sea-view lost, but all else was gone. In his great vexation, cursing the unfeeling demon of misfortune, he looked up suddenly, and before him appeared a vast city, with many lofty palaces piercing the clouds. The beast bore him into the city, making straight for the grand hall at its centre.

Hereupon Chung-li Ch’üan was glad, saying: ‘Lately I have often met with immortals; this place must surely be their abode. The beast meant well to bring me here to enjoy myself; otherwise, why would it not have devoured me early, or borne me back to its den? How came it thus to bring me to this fair place? But I grudge its swift flight; just now it passed many busy markets and I could not examine the conditions of these immortal marts; truly a loss.’ As he thought thus, the beast suddenly crouched down; Chung-li Ch’üan lost his seat and tumbled to the ground. Looking about, he found himself at the great hall. The scene there was beyond description; so exquisite and magnificent, he could only nod with admiration, deeming it a place of great interest and magnificence, and his heart was filled with gratitude to the beast.

As he wandered, he saw a person emerge, dressed in attire somewhat like the men of the imperial palace of the mortal world. Being a man of the capital, he often saw such and knew they were palace people, and knew also their apparel. But this man’s dress differed in size and breadth from the palace men. Presently he came to the hall court, smiled upon Chung-li Ch’üan, beckoning him: ‘The Sovereign summons you inside; you must be careful, and not be mischievous, do you understand?’ Having spoken, he approached and lightly struck him twice, saying: ‘After such rough riding, are you not weary?’

Chung-li Ch’üan now felt as if in a dream, knowing not what was afoot, nor where he was; yet he thought that the beast that bore him was surely sent by the Sovereign to welcome him. Since that was so, he knew that danger was wholly absent. Turning back to look at the beast, he saw it was a great white tiger with hanging eyes and forehead marked white. This was reckoned the fiercest type of tiger; Chung-li Ch’üan had ridden it all night, and now in retrospect felt some fear.

The man, seeing Chung-li Ch’üan intent on the tiger, laughed, saying: ‘Do you still plan to ask it to carry you back? Rest assured; after you have met the Sovereign, he will surely have a way to send you home.’ Chung-li Ch’üan saw that the man had guessed his thought wrongly, and could not help laughing outright; he made no further reply, but followed the man through several palace halls till they reached a small side hall. There he saw one sitting in stately robes, surrounded on each side by more than ten attendants, standing silently. Chung-li Ch’üan knew not the formal dress, but all he saw was more splendid and dignified than any other; and so he thought: ‘This must be the Sovereign.’ With some trepidation, he followed the man into the hall. The man went in first, as if to announce him.

The Sovereign held in his hand a book of yellow face and white heart, seeming to consult some matter. Hearing this, he smiled and said: ‘Bring him in.’ The man withdrew, and Chung-li Ch’üan was drawn up the steps and commanded to kneel in worship. The Sovereign bade him rise, and Chung-li Ch’üan thanked him.

The Sovereign drew him near, and Chung-li Ch’üan now saw he was a fair-faced man with a long beard, of kindly mien; his courage grew much. The Sovereign took his small hand, and asked if he was Chung-li Ch’üan, and if his master was Master Li Hsüan, also called Iron Crutch. Chung-li Ch’üan answered all affirmatively.

The Sovereign smiled, saying: ‘Do you still know who you were in a former life, and why you were cast down to the lower world as a man?’ Chung-li Ch’üan replied: ‘Lately, under Master Iron Crutch’s guidance, I have somewhat understood.’ The Sovereign smiled again: ‘Are you now willing to cultivate the Way?’ Chung-li Ch’üan made no immediate answer, but pressed his lips, put a forefinger to his mouth, and with eyes bright and sparkling, rolling about, looked towards the Sovereign with lively, innocent expression, full of charm and delight. The Sovereign and his attendants smiled with joy.

The Sovereign further said: ‘You are a man of celestial fate; if you set your heart, your achievement will be doubled with half the effort of ordinary men, and your future rank may equal that of your master; not as before, when you but tended your ancestor’s steed. I suppose your master has told you this.’ Chung-li Ch’üan only smiled shyly; he dared not believe he could attain such rank, yet was unwilling to dwell in unworthiness; so he could only smile and give no answer.

The Sovereign, knowing his mind, said: ‘I understand your meaning. This shows you have ambition, yet will not boast; this is the foundation of entering the Way. But you must also know, though you have taken your senior brother Li Iron Crutch as master, there is still error. First, your seniority is not proper; second, by rule, you should not be the Iron Crutch’s disciple, though you know not this. Iron Crutch, though an immortal, lacks care and judgment, and falsely claims mastership; this is his fault.’

Hearing this, Chung-li Ch’üan interposed: ‘With Master Li’s skill, why should he not be my teacher?’ The Sovereign laughed: ‘Now I tell you this, yet you will not understand. In brief, all who enter immortality do so by the same principle; among men, father and son, husband and wife, master and disciple, friends and acquaintances, their meetings and relations are not accidental, but all depend on fate. Now though you and that master cannot be called without fate, yet he may only be your teacher in skill and knowledge. In truth, the master is still Iron Crutch; but in name, let that master have it. This man, none other, child, you may well mark him: the Sovereign now before you is your true master, who will in time summon you to ascend and aid you in salvation.’

Chung-li Ch’üan then perceived the Sovereign’s meaning. The attendants urged him to bow and accept mastership. Chung-li Ch’üan was greatly perplexed, knelt, but would not immediately bow. In his heart he thought he had already taken a master, and that master was well; at home, how could he take another? If he bowed to this master, he knew the home master might not consent; and, as the Sovereign said, he still must consult Master Li in teaching; so this matter seemed unfair to Master Li; what excuse would he give?

While pondering, the Sovereign spoke again: ‘Child, do not hesitate. Your Master Li is but negligent now, lacking calculation; when he understands, he will himself retire to senior brother’s place. But this matter shall only bring you advantage and no harm. Think: one more master to guide you, is it not well? To speak frankly, your banishment by your ancestor was due to carelessness in herding cattle; the cause was your ancestor’s descent to save Iron Crutch. Iron Crutch, seeing you suffer through him, could not rest; being comrades, how could he not guide you? Not only he, but all the immortals of your ancestor’s line will watch over you for kin’s sake. Yet their duty is only to protect and teach; your true master is I, the Sovereign. Now you must take mastership; after returning, your master will understand. When he understands, he will no longer hold to mastership, yet you may still honour him as master, and he will still instruct you in the methods of cultivation and magic. When you succeed in cultivation, you may then redeem me to heaven.’

When the Sovereign spoke thus, he himself did not perceive it, but the many celestial officials present were struck dumb with amazement, and fell prostrate in fear. The Sovereign was greatly startled, and asked: ‘What is the matter with you all, that you behave thus?’ One of their leaders replied: ‘The Sage speaks no jest nor error; now the Sovereign suddenly says he must be redeemed to heaven by Chung-li Ch’üan. We, the humble, fear the Sovereign may descend to the mortal world in person.’

The Sovereign pondered, and stamped his foot in vexation, then said: ‘Rise, and hear my words.’ The officials rose and returned to their places. The Sovereign sighed: ‘I often say the hearts of men below are evil, and their sins many; I consider means of correction and good influence. Such great matters, unless I descend in person, how can they be accomplished? Perhaps I still have some bond with them; this is ordained by fate, and cannot be escaped. Since my first attainment of the Way and ascent, with the aid of Jade Emperor, and the instruction and support of Yuan-shih and Lao Tzu, and under the endorsement of the Queen Mother of the West, the Mysterious Maiden and other leaders, I stand equal with the Jade Emperor’s incarnation, honoured with imperial rank, entrusted for tens of thousands of years. Yet I have no merit or virtue with men; it is rare to have such destiny to descend again to mortal dust, to inspect the customs and morals of today, and to set the morality for myriad ages. I regard this work as no less than Lao Tzu’s repeated mortal births and classic writings, or Confucius’s teachings and example to all generations. How can the Sovereign of the Eastern Flower, dwelling long in heaven, compare even in the least with these? I have resolved that, after redeeming Chung-li Ch’üan to immortality, I will descend in person again, to receive his redemption; he and I will be master and disciple for ten thousand years. Pray, do not in future grieve me thus.’

The celestial officials bowed, heartily content, and said: ‘We little thought the Sovereign had so great a purpose. This is like the compassion of the Buddha Tathāgata: “If I do not enter hell, who shall enter?” And like the great virtue of the former sages: “If one man is unfed or unsheltered, it is my fault.” Such great merit is not to be compared with mere minor功行. We think it better for heaven to have one golden immortal than for the world to have one sage. When your term is complete and your功成, you will return to heaven, and the Jade Emperor will surely trust you more. What loss can it be to you? This is indeed the happiness of myriad generations, and the Sovereign’s greatest功德. Without the wisdom of heaven, who could turn misfortune to blessing, and treat calamity as peace? We are ashamed to rank among immortals, unable to understand your heart; our anxiety is but the shallow view of frogs in a well.’

The Sovereign quickly said: ‘You all have accumulated virtue and功德, and attained the rank of immortals; who would not seek to aid the world and save the people? Only my love is too great; I sometimes speak without thought, and show anxiety in countenance. As for my mind, I see that lately men excel in letters but lack substance; rites abound but feeling is thin; craft and guile daily increase. If this go on, the hearts of men will be changed to beasts, and customs grow ever more depraved, bringing an unprecedented great calamity and disaster without end. I am favoured by heaven, and long in high station, yet unable to aid in times of trouble; I feel the shame of idle days. To descend to the world and do my utmost to recover some, is indeed a field for making amends. If, as you say, I compare with Buddha Tathāgata, the Taoist Patriarch Li, Confucius and the ancient sages, how dare I claim the like?’ Then the officials praised him again.

Chung-li Ch’üan listened and understood; he now knew this was the Eastern Flower Sovereign, and with great awe, who at first had refused to take mastership, now needed no urging, and bowed thrice. The Sovereign laughed heartily; the celestial officials also laughed, saying: ‘Surely the child venerates the Sovereign’s holy virtue, and cannot help but be sincerely pleased.’ The Sovereign further said: ‘Your Master Li has the virtue of foresight; he will know all about today’s matter, but the secrets of heaven must not be told; to reveal them would be sin. You must be careful and not speak lightly.’

Chung-li Ch’üan bowed and accepted the command. The Sovereign then said: ‘Are you sent by Master Li to await Fei Ch’ang-fang coming from the north? He has already arrived at your home; you need not return, but go directly to the region of You-chou, and wait there for your master, the young lady He, and Fei Ch’ang-fang, all to gather. There is a matter that you must settle, and some comrades of yours are now imprisoned by men; you must also hasten to rescue them. Go.’ Chung-li Ch’üan inquired: ‘When I reach You-chou, where shall I seek my teachers?’ The Sovereign laughed: ‘With your master’s powers, how could you fail to find him? I tell you plainly, your master sent you to meet Fei Ch’ang-fang to test your courage and heart. Your nature is fierce and violent; you have slain many fierce beasts, and almost disregard all dangers. This time, to give you a little fright, to show you unforeseen things, is to test if you still have love and kindness, or if you remain as before, delighting only in killing and strength, regardless of life and danger. Thankfully you have patience, and have handled these matters well; otherwise, after the monster, there would have been second and third dreadful dangers. Your master calculated that Fei Ch’ang-fang could now return just in time to help you; so he sent you to meet him, that Fei Ch’ang-fang might bring you home.’

Chung-li Ch’üan laughed aloud. The Sovereign added: ‘But beware those mountain demons and ghosts, who, flattering themselves, take in disciples, preparing to gain progress and invite you to their side, promising benefits. Though childlike, this is arrogant; they do not consider their place. Having learned a few spells, and not having mastered even the small art of prolonging life and health, they think to be masters and redeem others. Not only do they make fools of themselves, but they scatter their mind; with divided mind, they cannot learn finely, cannot preserve themselves, and how can they aid others? I do not speak thus from the matter of last night alone, but out of compassion; I do not chide you harshly, but warn you against rashly taking disciples and recklessly transmitting Taoist arts to evil men. Such mischief would bring great disorder and bloodshed; you would be the first sinner, and your master and I would also be responsible. This is a terrible matter. Do not lightly treat it!’

Chung-li Ch’üan said: ‘I am but young, and ignorant of these harms; in future, even if I have skill, I will not kill rashly. Though I have consented to redeem that demon, I have broken faith with him; knowing its nature, if it should make trouble, not only I suffer, but also my two masters share the blame. Would this not be a perpetual source of trouble?’ The Sovereign smiled: ‘A man without faith cannot stand. Since you have truly promised, how can you suddenly prepare to break faith? It is well that, though this being is accepted by you, it does not have great fortune; rest assured, it will not harm you. You need only be more careful henceforth.’

Chung-li Ch’üan answered obedience, and asked: ‘Is this thing a demon or a ghost?’ The Sovereign replied: ‘A thousand years ago, a wicked man was sent by True Warrior Great Emperor’s black tiger to be devoured. His ghost lingers, sometimes appearing in the mountains, not greatly harmful, but frightening men who meet him into sickness. Now he often comes forth to receive the sunlight, and being deeply moved, his eyes emit light, and he can gather spectral energy to form human shape. In a hundred years more, his elixir will be complete; even without teaching, he will become a small power. But his nature remains fierce; though cultivated, his nature is hard to change, and his end may be foreseen. You must watch well.’

Chung-li Ch’üan bowed again, taking the commission. The Sovereign said: ‘You have stayed long here; stay no more. Take your old mount and go to You-chou.’ Chung-li Ch’üan prayed: ‘That tiger is very unruly; pray, grant me a divine wind to speed me thither.’ The Sovereign laughed: ‘Do not slight that tiger; it is a thousand times older than you. How can you think to command it? Very well; knowing your eagerness to taste the flavour of cloud-soaring, out of our relation as master and disciple, I will first teach you the art of cloud-riding. This art is unlike the common; at first you must recite certain spells and use certain mysteries; but when your heart is set, your feet will rise aloft. In an hour you may travel a hundred thousand li, rivaling your Master Iron Crutch. Such great magic is not for beginners to teach; but seeing your pure and upright intent, your kind heart, I make an exception and teach you. Now, having such rare honour, you should keep a pure heart and do many good deeds.’

Having spoken, he bade Chung-li Ch’üan come near, and whispered something in his ear. Chung-li Ch’üan was puzzled; the Sovereign said sternly: ‘Foolish child, this is the great art I teach you; what do you doubt?’ Chung-li Ch’üan understood, tried to recite the spell, and soon felt himself floating lightly, rising into the air. Chung-li Ch’üan shouted with delight: ‘Good master, dear master!’ Dancing in the air as if mad, he caused the Sovereign and the attendants to laugh heartily.

What events awaited Chung-li Ch’üan upon reaching You-chou, shall be told in the next chapter.
