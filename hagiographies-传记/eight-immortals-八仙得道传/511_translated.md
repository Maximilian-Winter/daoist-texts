# Chapter Forty-Three: The Meeting with the Old Fiend Zhongli’s Stratagem—Preserving the Husband, Meng Jiang, Suffers Calamity

Now it happened that the Sovereign of the East Flower, seeing Zhongli Quan so pleased, turned to the attendant immortals on either side and smiled, saying, “This child is so lively and simple-hearted, truly lovable.” One immortal official beside him reported, “Zhongli Quan is not only simple-hearted, but when he meets with serious affairs, he can yet be mature and steady. Such a man will assuredly not fail the Imperial Sovereign’s gracious favour in times to come.” The Sovereign was greatly pleased, and forthwith commanded, “Zhongli Quan, take good care of yourself. Go now to Youzhou, and need not return here again.”

Zhongli Quan then repeatedly bowed his head amidst the clouds, and with a bound he passed several hundred li, looking back to where the palace and courtyard once stood, now vanished from sight. At this moment, the joy in his heart was beyond all words. After some journeying, he took up again a playful mood, thinking thus: “Although Youzhou is far, having the method of cloud riding, I can reach it in a moment. It would be better to descend slowly along the low clouds, and leisurely enjoy the sights below; what harm could there be?” Having formed this thought, he deemed it very reasonable, and so lowered himself until he was but a few dozen feet above the earth. Looking down upon the figures below, he saw them very clearly; and those on earth could also see a small child slowly journeying northward in mid-air, as if borne by wind and cloud. Some looked up with wonder, some clicked their tongues in amazement; wherever he passed, many whispered and talked among themselves.

When he came to a certain pass, Zhongli Quan knew not what place it was, and was about to descend to inquire the road to Youzhou, and how far remained, lest he pass the spot. Just as he thought to descend, a sudden rushing sound came from behind; turning, he saw two Taoist priests hastening on clouds, laughing and chatting without restraint. One behind said, “What skill has Fei Changfang? His master, they say, is a lame Taoist.” These words caught Zhongli Quan’s ear, and he was startled. He stopped his cloud steps, intending to wait for their arrival and examine the matter with care. Ere he was fully roused, the two priests had come up, and they too saw the child journeying in the clouds.

The two consulted with one another awhile, then suddenly stayed their clouds and hailed Zhongli Quan. Only then did Zhongli Quan carefully survey the two priests. One had a snow-white face, a short stature, and seemed some two or three decades in age; the other had a brown complexion, a tuft of grey-white beard, and a crafty countenance, seeming about sixty years old. The elder first addressed Zhongli Quan: “Young sir, your honoured surname? Whence do you come? And whither are you bound now?” Zhongli Quan, having heard their disparaging words of Changfang and the crippled master, perceived them to be his foes; moreover, their looks were not those of upright men. He therefore would not tell them the truth, but smiling said, “My name is Zhongli, from Hebei; I am now by my master’s command seeking a senior brother, to deliver a certain message.” They quickly asked, “Who is your honoured master?” Zhongli Quan did not answer, but first inquired their Taoist names and from which immortal village they came. The white-faced one said he was Leng Shen, a Qi-refiner from Overseas; then pointing to the black-faced one, said, “That is Elder Brother Yan, who also comes from the sea and is bound for Youzhou; it is fitting to travel in company with you, young sir.”

Zhongli Quan then said, “I am a disciple of the Sovereign of the East Flower. My senior brother He Dagu follows Li Tiegua to Youzhou. My master says that Li Tiegua is no good man, and bids me summon him back to the mountain, so I hasten thither. May I ask what business you two masters have in Youzhou?” The two priests, hearing this, could not help but show joy to one another. Leng Shen said, “So the young sir is a disciple of the Sovereign; truly the young are talented, worthy of respect. That Li Tiegua is not a proper man; why does he have a crippled leg? It is because he was a habitual thief of other men’s wives, but met with a foe who caught him, and threw him from a roof to the ground, breaking one of his legs. Such a man cannot be associated with. No wonder the Sovereign bids you summon him back; it is truly wise. We two are disciples of the demonic sect, but have attained the way and become immortals. This journey is also because Li Tiegua sent Fei Changfang to seize one Fan Qiliang, who the Emperor now sends to the filled city, and plot to seize Fan’s wife, Meng Jiangnu. This is greatly against Heaven’s mandate; Tiegua’s crime deserves thunder’s wrath. The Emperor Qin, having learned the matter, specially sent us to exterminate Li Tiegua. Since you are bound for his side, and he is hated by your master, why not join forces and assist us as an inside agent? When the matter is accomplished, the Emperor will surely bestow rewards for merit; even your master’s side will gain honour. Would it not be excellent?”

Zhongli Quan, hearing this, secretly cursed, “You two demonic Taoists, what grudge has my master against you, that you slander him thus? Since you desire me as an inside agent, I will agree, and use your stratagem against you for my master to slay this villain. Why not?” Thinking thus, he laughed and answered, “What harm is there in that? But after you succeed, do not cast me aside and go alone to seek reward; I shall not consent to that.” The two laughed heartily, saying, “Young sir, you are too suspicious. The rewards come from the Emperor, and we need not pay a farthing; at most we but speak a word for you. Would we dare deceive you?” Zhongli Quan laughed with joy, and asked, “Then what official posts do you hold in Qin? How came you to serve the Emperor? Pray, inform me.” Elder Brother Yan replied, “The present Emperor is a sovereign who greatly values the Tao and trusts immortals. He once sent the minister Xu Fu to seek immortals by sea, but he encountered our elder brother Lao Jiao; Lao Jiao led him to meet our sect’s founder, Patriarch Tongtian. The Patriarch, with us two and our uncle Youmingzi, went to the capital and imparted the way of longevity. At this time, when this matter arose, the Emperor bade us first destroy the demonic men before receiving our titles.”

Zhongli Quan again asked, “Why did not Xu Fu go to Penglai, where many immortals dwell? Why did he not seek more aid there? Is it because Xu Fu did not know the path to Penglai?” The two laughed, “How can the immortals of Penglai compare with the disciples of our sect, who are numerous and all follow the right path? Not to mention others, consider the Emperor himself, a hero who has pacified the world and unified the six states, the true Son of Heaven. Could his insight be lacking? This time he sent Xu Fu to the sea, not to Penglai, but to seek our sect’s men. It shows that the two sects have their own distinctions of right and wrong. The ignorant know only that Penglai is the abode of immortals, not that this is all hearsay and blind following.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan’s heart grew almost aflame. By his nature he would have long since laid hands on them; but having been oft rebuked, he restrained himself, pondering and arranging things carefully, unwilling to act rashly. He found their talk very laughable, and wished to examine them further. So he endured and swallowed the anger within his belly, laughing aloud: “So it is thus! I am young and inexperienced, and do not understand such matters. What of this Xu Fu? Is he returned now?” The two said, “He is a good man; our Patriarch is pleased with him, giving him a floating field in the sea, and appointing him a king of a land. He leads many children thither to open the territory and multiply descendants. He calls himself the solitary ruler, the present emperor. Young sir, if you achieve great merit with us, we may petition the Patriarch for you to have an immortal mountain at sea, to become an independent lord and king.”

Zhongli Quan laughed heartily once more, then asked, “Since you want my help, please tell me what has happened. What was the former disturbance? Who is this Fan Qiliang of the filled city? Why did Fei Changfang have to seize him? What is the true matter?” Leng Shen laughed, “The Emperor, having had Heaven’s warning, dreamed of the fall of Qin by barbarians. He judged the strongest barbarians now to be the northern Xiongnu, and conscripted men throughout the realm to build a ten-thousand-li Great Wall along the border, appointing General Meng Tian as commander. Fan Qiliang, husband of Meng Jiangnu, was among the conscripts. Meng Jiangnu, unwilling to part from her husband and suffer hardship, resolved to accompany him. The wise Emperor, seeing Meng Jiangnu’s heavenly looks, was moved to pity, and sent attendants to care for her all the way.”

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan’s heart was full of laughter; he asked, “If the Emperor is so wise and so fond of Meng Jiangnu, would it not be better to relieve Fan Qiliang of his conscription, so the couple might be reunited, rather than spending more men and wasting grain in sending her attendants? Truly this is the height of perversity. You two say the Emperor is wise; I find this hard to understand.” The two were struck dumb, unable to reply for a time.

Then Elder Brother Yan said, “Indeed; all at first suspected the Emperor was meddlesome. Later, when Fan Qiliang reached the north, General Meng’s proclamation said the vast works of the Great Wall required a land spirit to oversee them. Fan Qiliang was found virtuous and appointed to this office. His earthly life was fulfilled; his body was to be entombed in the wall’s embankment. Meanwhile, the emperors of Yin and Yang decreed him land god, to ensure the work’s secret aid, so that demons, ghosts, beasts might not hinder, and the great work be finished without fail. Otherwise, resistance would arise, storms would come, and the wall would never be complete. The decree appointing Fan Qiliang land god was shown to the Emperor, who awoke with a start, knowing Fan Qiliang was Meng Jiangnu’s husband. Though he pitied their separation, this was a matter of state, the foundation of the imperial line for all generations, and the fate was fixed by Heaven. Fan Qiliang consented to die and become a god. Meng Jiangnu, living still in the world, would have a divine husband, and some future benefit. To fail this destiny through weak pity would harm them more. Therefore, on an appointed day, Fan Qiliang was bound and offered in sacrifice to earth and heaven, entombed in the wall’s embankment. Another decree bade the attendants still escort Meng Jiangnu safely back to the capital. But at this time an unexpected matter occurred: a disciple of the immortal Wenmei, named Zhang Guo, passing here, seeing injustice, opposed General Meng’s taking an innocent man to be wall-filling. By slight magic he blinded the eyes of the people, and rescued Fan Qiliang from the embankment. They planned to escape Youzhou and flee south to avoid pursuit. But Fan Qiliang, saying he would live and die with his wife, refused to abandon her, and planned to seize Meng Jiangnu. She was guarded by troops, making it hard to act; the two delayed several days. When news reached the capital, our uncle came there, and the Emperor sent him to subdue Zhang Guo and recover Fan Qiliang. Our uncle, greatly skilled, was ten times superior to Zhang Guo. Coming to Youzhou, he discovered where Zhang Guo and Fan Qiliang hid; in a breath of wind he spirited Fan Qiliang away, and by magic entranced Zhang Guo, imprisoning him in the general’s camp. After this, Fei Changfang arrived. Though he has some minor magic, he is no match for our uncle. Coming to Youzhou, hearing of Zhang Guo’s capture, he used magic to mix into the army and rescued him. When he sought to rescue Fan Qiliang likewise, our uncle perceived it and drove him away. Zhang Guo, relying on his skill, resisted our uncle, but was captured again. Changfang, relying on his power to shrink the earth, vanished in a moment. Our uncle had no means but to let him escape. Later it was learned he was a disciple of Li Tiegua, and would certainly invite his master to come. Therefore we were sent to assist. Now meeting you, young sir, is a great fortune. If you can take advantage of Li Tiegua’s meditation to stab him dead with the sword, you will save a war and merit boundless merit. Otherwise, when we arrive, you can serve as inside agent to catch them unawares, and they will be easily taken. This is your great achievement. Consider which plan you prefer.”

Zhongli Quan thought and said, “The first plan is simpler; but Li Tiegua is a man of the Way; how can ordinary weapons kill him?” Leng Shen hastened to reply, “If young sir is willing, I have a magic treasure, made of refined golden essence, a small box containing sixteen flying swords of Immortal Execution. Once opened, all sixteen fly forth at once; save for the great Luo Golden Immortal in heaven, none can escape this doom. This is called the Primordial Immortal Execution Box. If young sir can exert himself, I may lend it to you. Best to open it suddenly when he is off guard, and with one gesture strike him down. The method is very convenient.” Zhongli Quan laughed, “A man’s word having been given, how can he go back? Pray lend me the treasure to see if it be so.” The two exchanged glances and hesitated. Elder Brother Yan said, “Now we travel in the clouds; it is inconvenient to produce the treasure. Let us wait until we reach Youzhou and meet our uncle, then we may lend it to you.” Zhongli Quan said no more.

After a while, the two said that below was the Youzhou border. Zhongli Quan looked down and saw the place was not very bustling, far less prosperous than the capital. He followed the two down from the clouds to the camp of General Meng as they said. There an old Taoist met them with two novices, and the two priests called him their uncle. After bowing, he bade Zhongli Quan salute. Zhongli Quan felt disdain but, fearing to jeopardize the serious matter, performed the rite. The two explained the cause to the old Taoist, who then fixed his eyes on Zhongli Quan, nodded, and said, “Very good. How old are you, child? Why have you become a disciple of the Patriarch of the East Flower?”

Zhongli Quan laughed and was angry at heart, but spoke cleverly, telling a casual lie to deceive the old Taoist, who believed him. The old Taoist ordered him to remain nearby to await further orders, promising that after the great deed was done he would personally take him to the Eastern Sea to teach him Taoist arts, and report to the Emperor to seek for him a reward. Zhongli Quan thanked and withdrew.

The old Taoist then summoned Yan and Leng into an inner chamber, whispering awhile, then called Zhongli Quan in again. He asked if he truly had courage to assassinate Li Tiegua. Zhongli Quan replied, “With the Immortal Execution treasure, why should I fear? Without it, I would not dare go empty-handed.”

The old Taoist smiled and nodded, saying, “Of course you cannot go empty-handed. Li Tiegua and the others have arrived and met us; I have burned the demoness surnamed He with poison fire. I expect them soon to seize Zhang Guo; we shall ambush and besiege them. But such stratagems can only trick others; we may not capture Li Tiegua thereby. So we send you first to scout. If you learn when they will come, return quickly to report. Meantime, keep good relations with them. If you can stab him to death, all the better. Otherwise, accompany Li Tiegua in the assault, following closely, and when he is off guard, suddenly produce the treasure to kill him. This is a great matter; you must be very cautious. If you fail, the law of men is unforgiving, and the celestial code more so. Your life will be at risk. Measure yourself; if you cannot do it, tell me now, that you may not regret it later.”

Zhongli Quan, angered, thought that the life of these demonic Taoists was already in his hands, and no need to debate with them, so he agreed at once, saying, “I obey the Patriarch’s orders; I dare not be rash or fail my master’s trust.” The old Taoist was pleased, praising him, and gave him Leng Shen’s treasure box, repeatedly urging caution. Zhongli Quan took the commission and was escorted out, going straight to the Earth God temple outside the western gate, where Li Tiegua dwelt.

What further matters befell Zhongli Quan after meeting Master Tiegua, we shall consider in the following chapter.
