# Chapter 44: The Discourse of the Geomancers of Youzhou on Past Events — Xu Fu Establishes a New Dominion in the Eastern Sea

Now it happened that Zhongli Quan, having met with Master Iron Crutch, prostrated himself upon the ground, and bowed his head without ceasing. Master Iron Crutch, perceiving this, hastened to call Fei Changfang to raise him up, and laughingly said, "I congratulate you; now at length you have obtained your true master. It was I who rashly assumed the position of master, and in my heart I feel very ashamed; but what fault have you in this?" Zhongli Quan, hearing Master Iron Crutch thus speak, grew the more uneasy. Yet he was born in the wilds, and of a nature most loyal and honest, never accustomed to speak with ceremony; his heart unsettled, his face flushed, his tongue tied, and his breath choked — a condition most distressing.

Master Iron Crutch, knowing his mind, could not help but laugh aloud, saying, "Do you suppose that having acknowledged a new master, I, who falsely assumed the master’s place, would sever relations with you as if cutting cloth and parting the bosom? Know that you and I belong originally to the same school, we are but brethren; and by reason you are the younger brother, now degraded and descended to the mortal world, shall the elder brother not exert himself to protect and care for you? Though I have now descended the mountain for other matters, I may say that half of my purpose is for you; it is to awaken you, to instruct you, to support and assist you, that you may not forget your origin, that you may soon escape the mortal dust, and ascend to the celestial realm. When these matters are accomplished, my duty to you is fulfilled. Why then should we cling to the names of master and disciples or brethren? Is it not more reasonable that I, being master, should concern myself with your affairs, and that you, being younger brother, should receive my care and teaching without fail? And how can you say that only by becoming my student can you enjoy my instruction and assistance, or that by becoming my junior brother you forfeit the benefits of my cultivation? Even by the common view of the world, which ever speaks of gratitude and repayment of kindness, we are transcending the common lot; to speak of such things is beyond us. Yet even if we did seek gratitude and repayment, it is enough that you understand my earnest intention and good will; that you do not bring disgrace upon yourself, that you do not abandon yourself, but diligently cultivate, and return early to the ranks of the immortals, that I too may complete my duty to you as soon as may be, and my anxious care be thus explained. This is the first method by which you may repay kindness. Not to speak of me, take your new acknowledged ancestor and master — with such rank and attainment, does he hope for your repayment? What he expects is not other than the few words I have spoken. It is plainly seen that as master, as friend, or as brother, the facts and results are all the same; what more should you trouble yourself about?"

Thus Master Iron Crutch discoursed, with earnestness and sincerity, and with humility yet manifesting encouragement. The fairy maiden and Fei Changfang, sitting on either side, could not but sigh in admiration. Zhongli Quan, however, felt still more uneasy within; from his temples flowed two streams of shameful sweat. Master Iron Crutch yet continued, saying, "Although thus, the name and form cannot be neglected. From this day forward, you should address me as 'Senior Brother,' in accord with the manner of the eldest daughter; and I will call you 'Junior Brother,' as was the custom in former lives. This will restore our former state."

Having said this, he laughed heartily. But Zhongli Quan, hearing these words, suddenly was full of tears, and approached the side of Master Iron Crutch, prostrating himself and weeping aloud. Since his birth, through many dangers and calamities, if he had wept thus, he could never remember so; from the time of his understanding it was perhaps the first. The three — Master Iron Crutch, the fairy maiden, and Fei Changfang — naturally understood his meaning. After a while he ceased weeping and said loudly, "Master, your disciple is coarse of speech and blunt of tongue, and cannot express himself well; yet what you have said today is surely the great truth of a master. Even the Eastern Flower Ancestor speaks thus. But though the fact be so, yet in my heart I cannot feel at ease without the old form of address; it is not only the form of address, but I wish that my master will treat me as before, that the disciple and master be as in former times, and so only can I be at peace to apply myself earnestly, to receive the master's teaching, and not fail the master's hope. Otherwise, I fear I shall receive no benefit, and the pains of both masters be wasted; better then to return home quickly and live with my father among beasts. These few words are all I can say, not knowing what politeness means; in any case, this is no matter of politeness. I have said my say; no more speech can I speak. If my master will not consent, then he may as well not be my senior brother. I beg my master to forgive me."

Master Iron Crutch saw that although his speech was unpolished, it was most earnest and sincere; the more he saw his innocence and truthfulness, the less did he feel able to oppose him, and was at a loss what to do. Yet Fairy He and Fei Changfang, unable to bear this, spoke in his stead: "What both master and junior brother have said is most true; but that your master instructs you in the Way, and gradually promotes and cares for you, is a real matter, not a mere empty word to be glossed over. Since this is so, surely there is no shame or embarrassment in the name; and as among the three teachings there are many examples of one person learning from many masters, this is what is meant by the saying that the sages have no fixed master. Now since master and brother Quan have each their views, we are willing to act as mediators, to proceed by the method of moderation. Master in all things be humble, and will not insist again on master’s place; it is no harm to call him junior brother according to former rank. And Quan, clearly a disciple, may all the more reverence his master by due rites. Let all be as before; what can be amiss?"

Master Iron Crutch could but consent, laughing and saying, "This child is so stubborn, I have no way to teach him otherwise. Luckily the Eastern Flower Emperor will understand that I am not one to boast of mastery or contemn my elders, hence being presumptuous; surely he will forgive me. Quan, you may rise now; why yet do you weep?" Zhongli Quan still felt it was not quite right, and said, "Since master has admitted to the master’s rites, why then call me junior brother? Not only am I unwilling to consent, but I fear the laughter of others, who will say I am the insolent disciple, and that my master is too modest; this too is unreasonable!"

Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying, "Enough, enough, do not argue further. In any case, call you 'Ah Quan' or 'Quan-er,' it is all the same; you may accept carelessly as you like. By rights, immortal affairs must accord with proper names and words, not be so careless; yet today’s matter is not common, and must be somewhat accorded with. This is enough to settle it!" Zhongli Quan now rose. He had not yet seen Fei Changfang; Master Iron Crutch pointed him out, and then smilingly said to him, "I sent you to meet Changfang, partly to test your true courage; it is no marvel if you have courage and strength, but you must show benevolence and act with chivalry; it is not easy for you to do all that without betraying my mind. There is yet a small fault; your ancestor has already admonished you not to speak of it again. At the time, a calculation was made, determining that after you encountered the demons and awakened from your dream, that was the time of Changfang’s return; the two of you should meet in the mountains. So you were sent to receive him, the very proof that you might return together. Yet at evening of the next day Changfang indeed arrived, but you were not with him; this caused doubt. With repeated secret computation, it was known that the Eastern Flower Emperor again took occasion to dispatch the White Tiger General to receive you. Truly the emperor’s Taoist skill is profound, beyond our capacity; yet by a single slip, he has sown a fate for rebirth; the emperor may be said to have brought trouble upon himself; but for you it is an unexpected great fortune, a rare encounter that comes but once in ten thousand years. Probably you have long followed the ancestor; the ancestor saved men and the world, established virtue and words, his merits cover the universe, his Tao equals that of the imperial heaven. You are only a child, but having followed him long, your merit is much; thus in your incarnation you have such a strange encounter. All this is still the blessing of the ancestor; it is no chance matter, not to be misunderstood."

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan was fully enlightened. He saw that the two masters knew all things without seeing, perceived all things without hearing, measuring each other without a hair’s breadth of error; and in astonishment was filled with joy. Suddenly his childish nature appeared again; he ran to the side of Master Iron Crutch, clinging as though glued, his whole body trembling with laughter, saying, "Who would have thought that both your reverences have thousand-mile eyes and ears that hear with the wind? To be your disciple is truly not easy. If we have some faults, we ourselves are not aware, yet you two already have your thunderbolts upon our heads!" Then he shook his head and clicked his tongue, saying, "So formidable, so formidable, extraordinary, extraordinary!" These few words caused Master Iron Crutch and the two disciples to laugh heartily.

Master Iron Crutch then took hold of his topknot with one hand and his little arm with the other, laughing and comforting him, saying, "Child, your insight is good; a man must be so careful, and in the cultivation of the Way must be especially circumspect. But I must further instruct you: cultivation depends upon oneself, not on others. If one fears guilt and responsibility, dare not be negligent, he cannot be called a gentleman who cherishes punishment and keeps the law. Yet in his character there is already a defect; as if his cultivation is not from his true heart’s desire, but because he dares not do otherwise, fearing blame and punishment. Is this not like a naughty child who wishes to avoid the schoolroom and escape the rod by cunning?" At this, Zhongli Quan laughed first, saying, "I but so spoke; who is there that does not have such faults?" Master Iron Crutch and Fairy He laughed again.

The master continued, "This is one truth; yet there is another phrase you have spoken wrongly. The laws of immortals and the ordinances of men are alike, having degrees and distinctions; according to the magnitude of the offence. If, as you say, thunderbolts are frequently used, how many times can a mortal endure lightning and fire? If small matters also are punished so severely, would this not be worse than the present foolish emperors? Good child, I know your words are but jest; yet even in jest there must be measure, lest one be lightly laughed at. In an emergency, a single slip may breed calamity to the heavens. Did you not see what befell your ancestor yesterday? Though he long had this intention, a single slip of the tongue was like a released arrow, irretrievable. The root lies in the daily mood; not necessarily in the slip of the tongue, but the heart concealed within, and the mouth speaking without. The concealed heart may for a time be delayed; a slight utterance becomes the cause of action. When the time is ripe, even with the power of the heavenly emperor, it cannot be restrained for a moment. Is it not dangerous? Is it not fearful?" These words left Zhongli Quan silent for some while.

Master Iron Crutch then admonished, "Ah Quan, this matter is a heavenly secret; you must not leak it; under no circumstances should you speak of it carelessly, for to do so would be to violate the heavenly laws." Zhongli Quan promised assent. He and Fei wished to inquire further, yet dared not speak.

Master Iron Crutch then smiled and said to Zhongli Quan, "The two demons you met on the way — one was a white fox spirit, the elder Yan Daoist; the other Leng Shen, a rabbit who attained the essence. The fox is cunning, the rabbit naturally shrewd; though they can change to human form and have some Taoist skill, they cannot escape their nature. So at sight of you they wished to take advantage, to use you. They knew not that the Eastern Flower Ancestor is a celestial noble golden immortal, utterly incompatible with their heresy; yet they pretend to be orthodox, treating you as a puppet. The elder Taoist they call uncle, but he is not a transformed beast but a former bandit chief named Li Gecko, so called for his boldness and ability to climb walls; a man of many crimes who suddenly repented and became a monk, and also attained his present rank. He is a powerful subordinate of the Sovereign of the All-Under-Heaven. They intercepted Xu Fu, whom Qin Shi Huang sent to the sea, and by slight sorcery made Xu Fu believe them to be true immortals, and entrusted to them the emperor’s imperial edicts. They came to Xianyang in the imperial presence, yet left Xu Fu and his company of several tens upon an island in the sea. Fortunately, my senior brothers, the Perfected Piao Miao and Fire Dragon, took pity on them, having fallen into this trap with no way home. They exercised great magic to establish a village, brought seeds of grain, silkworm eggs, mulberry trees and the like, so that they might till and weave, and no longer need to return to China. Over time they multiplied and might form a state to endure through the ages. One cause is that Xu Fu’s heart was kind, and moreover he went for our teaching; though deceived, he should be treated with special grace, to show the great and boundless benevolence of our teaching. Another is that Qin Shi Huang was cruel beyond measure; the demons Xu Fu took would reveal their true nature before long; when the truth appears, the demons cannot stand, and Xu Fu would be guilty of deceiving the sovereign. Hence he was not allowed to return; this was also an act of protection and preservation. It is heard that the two Perfected took much trouble on his behalf, and even went to the sea to summon the Dragon King and his family. The island extends from north to south, projecting into the Eastern Sea in a narrow and slanting form; when wind and waves arise, the residents of both shores suffer great harm. The shape being narrow and slanting, the loss of either shore leaves only a small interior; plainly half the country would be lost. Therefore they specially charged care for it, to avert disaster. Yet in the sea the quantity of wind, waves, and rain is fixed; the reduction of wind and waves near the shores of the island must be transferred to the distant ocean, making the sea more turbulent than before. In future, Chinese ships must venture great peril to reach the island. Fire Dragon Perfected said well: 'This island is lone, suspended beyond the sea. By immortal arts it is established, self-protected and sufficient for life. Should invasion occur, it would be hard to resist. The natural wind and waves form a shield, which is a most excellent means of defence.' Our aid to Xu Fu was not needed to such a degree; the reason was to leave some memorial in the great sea, to manifest the boundless power of our immortal arts."

Master Iron Crutch’s tale ended here. Fairy He smiled and asked, "Such a great island, was it never before inhabited? Relying on the several tens of boys and girls brought by Xu Fu, to multiply and grow populous will not be easy." Master Iron Crutch nodded and said, "It is said the island’s inhabitants are still as in the ancient times. In future, the increase of population will naturally take these children as root; but because of the urgent need to multiply, there is the evil of premature marriages. According to human vitality and physiology, strong breeding is unlikely; therefore the two Perfected instructed the Dragon King to dispatch water government healers to seek the yang way of the sea dogs, and to make a medicine to strengthen body and breed, given to Xu Fu to distribute among the children. By this method, the descendants left behind will be sturdier than elsewhere, though somewhat shorter; a fitting phrase is ‘short, small, and strong,’ which is the marvel of the immortals! Besides this, there is an unavoidable matter: the marriages are not in accordance with ancient Chinese rites; there is no parental consent nor matchmaker’s word; consent alone suffices, and no one censures them as improper. A man may have many wives at once; a woman may love many men at once; those who love today may part tomorrow; each may seek others at will. Should a spouse die, remarriage is most proper. In sum, the population is too small, isolated from the outside world, and cannot intermarry with other states; the rulers’ first urgent duty is to multiply quickly; all who can bear children are allowed to do so without question. This is the origin of the evil; in future licentiousness will flourish beyond control. The saying ‘to act on coldness breeds harm, to act on greed breeds greater harm’ applies here fully."

All present nodded and sighed. Master Iron Crutch laughed again, saying, "See how absurd these demons are! Even in the matter of Xu Fu, my two senior brothers know how much effort they made to bring him to this island, clear the land, root out weeds, and found a new state. Yet they have the impudence to claim it as their own merit; is it not laughable?" Zhongli Quan smiled and said, "That is just so; they say the same to me." Master Iron Crutch, Fei, and Fairy He all laughed heartily. Master Iron Crutch went on, "Since they dare to covet others’ merits, they will surely resort to their base means, harming Xu Fu’s descendants without end. Watch and see!" The three nodded and sighed.

Master Iron Crutch then asked Zhongli Quan, "Can you take out that treasure box they gave you, and let us play with it?" Zhongli Quan laughed, saying, "Master foresees all; those demon servants still dare to plot secretly; truly they do not know their measure." Saying this, he took from his bosom the treasure box and gave it to Master Iron Crutch. But his heart was too eager; he could not wait, and opened the box. Suddenly there was a loud explosion, and swords sprang forth, dividing and stabbing towards Master Iron Crutch and the two disciples. Immediately a cry was heard, and two were wounded, falling to the ground.

Who they were, and their fate, will be revealed in the next chapter.
