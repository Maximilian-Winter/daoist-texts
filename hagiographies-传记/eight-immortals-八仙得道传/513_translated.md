# Chapter Forty-Five: The Misuse of the Magical Treasure Nearly Brings Great Calamity — The Golden Needles Sent Forth to Win a Remarkable Victory

But now it befell that Zhongli Quan, being of a mischievous and impetuous temper, at once produced the sword-box given him by the demon, and could not wait to open it a little. Thereupon, at a moment’s notice, all the swords shot forth together. Fei Changfang was struck upon the waist and thigh, and immediately fainted away. The Immortal Maiden also was wounded in the arm, crying out aloud as she fell backwards; happily, Zhongli Quan stood just behind and caught her in his arms. Only Master Iron Crutch showed no change of countenance, though he was pierced by swords in seven or eight places, yet no blood appeared, nor did he feel any pain, as if he were quite unconscious of the injuries. At this time Zhongli Quan was already struck with horror, his face changed colour with fear and shame, so that he knew not where to hide himself; he hastily prostrated on the ground, beating his head incessantly, his face turning from green to white, from white to green, and suddenly showing a red colour as if smeared with blood; never before since his birth had he known such terror.

Master Iron Crutch cried out, “Why do you not rise and help your senior brother Fei?” Zhongli Quan then cautiously rose and lifted Fei Changfang in his arms. The Master muttered words of incantation, and with a shout of “Swift!” he pointed his finger and traced three circles around Fei, when suddenly Fei uttered a cry and awoke from his swoon. The Immortal Maiden, already roused, was pale as paper and kept crying out in pain. Master Iron Crutch smiled at her and said, “Why do you keep hidden the Divine Pill? Bring it quickly and make use of it.” The Immortal Maiden was instantly enlightened; she hastened to take from her pouch the pill granted by the Mysterious Lady. The Master bade the two each take one pill, half to be swallowed with warm water, half to be dissolved with saliva and anointed upon the wounds; before the meal was ended, the marks of injury were all at rest, and no pain remained.

All beholding that Master Iron Crutch, though most wounded, suffered no pain, were filled with admiration and wonder. The Master laughed and said, “This is nothing strange. The worth of an immortal lies in having no notion of others, no notion of self; no notion of others, therefore there is none in the world to be feared; no notion of self, therefore there is nothing in the world to hurt me. For I have neither notion; no matter what sword or blade you use, or even the poisonous fireflies set loose by the old demon the other day — though you saw those swarming about my person, yet by a flash of cold light I dispersed them without trace. Why did Sister He escape harm, yet Brother Changfang suffer a slight loss? This is because of the difference between having self and having no self.” Both were moved and gave praise.

Seeing Zhongli Quan still kneeling stiffly, they besought pardon on his behalf: “Though he is of a childish heart, yet his fault is unintentional; the disciples have suffered and are now free from pain by the Master’s Tao and the Mysterious Lady’s Divine Pill, so we beg the Master to pardon and teach him.” Master Iron Crutch bade him rise. Zhongli Quan first thanked his master, then made apology to the two others. The Master could not forbear a rebuke, and said, “Now it is well to use their own stratagem against them. To-morrow you must go back to see that old demon, and say that we are grievously wounded and cannot meet in battle, so as to soothe their mind. If he should come to attack us, that would be best of all. Moreover, the old demon’s poison fire is gathered from ten thousand fireflies, and made with the most deadly drugs and fearful spells of the four seas. The other day Brother Fei was almost slain by it; happily I poured out the gourd water at the moment to extinguish its light, so all was well. Though I escaped harm, I could not destroy him. You shall steal this thing by such and such means, and in that way atone for your fault. Take care, and be no more careless in play.” Zhongli Quan answered to all commands.

Master Iron Crutch then delivered the sword-box to him, bidding, “Once this box is used, a further incantation must be added before it can be closed and opened again. Take it back to deliver to the Flame Daoist, so as to strengthen their faith.” Little did they know that Zhongli Quan, hearing this, was somewhat unwilling to rise. He suddenly asked, “Master, this thing has caused me much trouble. I thought to keep it for my amusement; shall I so easily return it to them?” The Master laughed heartily, “You, a man who has put away the world to cultivate the Way, yet so greedy for others’ things — what sort of talk is this? I tell you plainly, all their treasures will sooner or later be ours; why should you be anxious?” Immortal Maiden also smiled, patting his back, “Junior Brother, go and win merit; such demons are of no great account. Never mind that all shall be ours in time. We will simply remake such a thing; to them it will be a great vexation, but to the Master but a wave of the hand — nothing worthy of mention.” Zhongli Quan then gladly obeyed.

On the morrow, Zhongli Quan returned to the Meng Tian camp, where the Old Daoist and the two demons Flame and Cold met him with congratulations on his great achievement. Zhongli Quan was at first bewildered, but after Cold Shen’s explanation understood that after his departure, as they had little confidence, Flame and Cold had gone in person to spy on the matter, and had heard the sound of the box opening, and seen a sword-light shoot from the chamber to the clouds. At first the two demons were startled, but after inquiry learned that Iron Crutch and the others were all wounded, though not dead, and unlikely to recover soon. They thought Zhongli Quan must have done a great deed and would return at once to camp; but waiting a long while, no movement came, and they could not guess the cause, so returned in haste. After a night’s rest they began to deliberate. Just then news came of Zhongli Quan’s arrival, and all congratulated him and asked why he had not come the day before.

Zhongli Quan laughed, “My skill was very subtle. To tell you the truth, those three demons do not yet know it was I who played this trick; they think you sent someone to lie in wait outside the window to fight with flying swords, and would never suspect me. I took advantage of their stupor to gather up the swords and the box. If you doubt it, look! The treasure has been used, has it not? But now it cannot be closed again. What is the reason for this?” The Old Daoist and the two demons heard and were greatly pleased, saying, “Never mind; this thing can only be used once. To use it twice, the incantation must be repeated.” Cold Shen took the box and muttered some words, and indeed the box closed again, just as before.

At once Zhongli Quan offered counsel: “I report to the three masters that now Iron Crutch and his disciples have been wounded by me and cannot stir; it were best to take this opportunity to attack their dwelling and capture the three demon Daoists; or better yet, use the Master’s poison fire to burn them to death — would that not be excellent?” The Old Daoist nodded, “Your plan pleases me well; we will go tonight.” Then he said to Zhongli Quan, “You should return to that place, for Iron Crutch is very skilled. The poison fire could not harm him last time, so it is not easy to deal with him. But I am sure his skill, great though it be, may be overcome if taken unawares. For now, it is better you take the sword-box back, and when we come, while Iron Crutch is busy in front, you may secretly harm him from behind; there can be no mistake.”

Zhongli Quan hastily replied, “That cannot do. Though the sword-box is fierce, it is not what Iron Crutch fears. Though he escaped the poison fire, that is not what he dreads most. I heard him speak of this treasure; even his face changed colour, and he warned us again and again that if the poison fire came, we must flee at once. You see, he fears the poison fire greatly; even now he has no way to guard against it. Better let the Patriarch give me this thing, and when the two sides meet in battle, while they are busy, I will approach, send forth the poison fire, and cast many fireflies upon their vital parts, so as to strike at their lives. Though they have celestial power, they cannot escape this great calamity.”

The Old Daoist hesitated at first, for he depended upon this treasure; if a mishap befell, the calamity would be great. But thinking the plan clever and necessary to slay Iron Crutch, and seeing that though young Zhongli Quan was yet mature in his acts, he judged no fault would occur, so consented, tremblingly handing over the poison fire bottle to Zhongli Quan, and admonishing him thrice, “You must be most careful; if this thing is damaged, half my life is lost.” Zhongli Quan, hearing this, was glad and amused, pitying the Old Daoist, and could scarce refrain from saying, “It is just what I wish — to see your life all gone.” He strove to hide his laughter, but took the bottle with great gravity, and bade farewell to the three demons, returning to Master Iron Crutch’s dwelling to report his achievement.

By this time Master Iron Crutch had already reckoned that Zhongli Quan would return in merit, and personally came out with He and Fei to meet him. Zhongli Quan hastened to kneel and say, “Master, be not so courteous; I deserve it not.” Master Iron Crutch laughed, “You who can be so cautious are truly a man of great affairs; how can you not be revered? The reason I show you such respect is that I hope you will always deal with matters so maturely, and not disgrace the little esteem I show you today.” Zhongli Quan entered with the three, laughing, “So then, I dare not accept your respect the more.” All laughed heartily.

Master Iron Crutch bade them take out the firefly bottle, saying, “They will surely attack us tonight; Changfang may oppose the Cold Demon. This thing has but one jade pestle, which can change size; to mortals, one stroke would grind them to dust. Though Changfang has no great merit, having taken my Bone-Easy Golden Pill, he is not of the mortal frame, and may hold my sword against him. If they fight evenly, I will come to aid. Sister may oppose the Flame Daoist; this one is not like Cold Shen, whose merit is deep. You have experienced his sword-box; though it cannot kill you, it must not be neglected. You have the Mysterious Lady’s piercing needles, which can change to ten thousand forms, fully enough to break the box. When the demon fox is dead, you may join Changfang to fight the hare.”

They received these instructions. Master Iron Crutch suddenly uncovered the gourd and drew forth a magic treasure, smiling at Zhongli Quan: “I have hidden the poison fireflies, but by magic produced a false firefly bottle, and made your body into two; the false body holds the false bottle at my side, never leaving me, seeming to wait the time to release the fireflies, while the true body hides in the air. When I send forth the crystal light pearl, at that moment you drop this treasure from the sky; it will bury the old demon alive in the earth, with no escape.”

Zhongli Quan took it and saw it was but a lump of mud. He laughed, “Master, all say I am mischievous, and you often scold me for naughtiness; who would have thought you were fond of play? This is but a lump of mud — what treasure is this? Even if it be a treasure, to throw it on a man’s head would but raise a bump; how can it bury the old demon alive? Is this not laughable?” His words made Immortal Maiden and Fei Changfang laugh; they said he was indeed childlike in his understanding — how could immortal treasures be judged by common things? Master Iron Crutch, however, sternly said, “No more words. Are you so clever? You see but a lump of mud, and think it can only raise a bump? How do you know this thing cannot bury a little old demon?” Zhongli Quan was frightened and dared not ask again; he took the mud lump, suppressing laughter and doubt, intending to test it at night.

After dusk, Master Iron Crutch had changed Zhongli Quan’s body and the firefly bottle, all ready. Suddenly a gust of wind was heard in the air, and the Master laughed to the three, “The demons have come.” They looked up to see three black clouds approaching from the east, settling on their courtyard — indeed the three demon Daoists. Master Iron Crutch bade He and Fei act quickly. The Old Daoist, seeing Iron Crutch and the others unhurt and prepared, was greatly startled and did not suspect Zhongli Quan’s device. Having come, he was not afraid, and divided with the two demons to meet them; the three fought in pairs. The false Zhongli Quan held the false firefly bottle, never leaving Master Iron Crutch. The Old Daoist saw this and secretly rejoiced.

The pairs of swords and spears and cudgels first tested their skill; indeed the Flame Daoist could not overcome Immortal Maiden He, and hastily released the sword-box; but Immortal Maiden repelled the flying swords with ten thousand golden needles from her mouth. The swords and needles met with a clang, the sword-light grew dark and the needle-light bright; the Flame Daoist felt his eyes could no longer open. As he tried to flee, his eyes were pierced by the needles and blinded; rolling on the ground, he revealed his true form — a white fox, speaking human words and begging for mercy. Immortal Maiden’s heart was softened; she wished to spare his life, but when all the needles were sent forth together and the swords repelled, the white fox was pierced through and died an untimely death. Immortal Maiden gathered up her needle-swords and turned to aid Fei Changfang. Fei’s immortal sword was fierce; Cold Shen’s jade pestle was no less powerful; the two fought evenly. When Immortal Maiden joined, skilled in Daoist magic and strength, and with Flame Daoist dead, Cold Shen was greatly afraid and fled, dragging his pestle. Immortal Maiden still sent golden needles at his back; with a cry and a gush of blood, he nearly sullied their weapons. They hastened to stop, and saw a rabbit dead on the ground.

The Old Daoist and Iron Crutch fought with their swords for seventy or eighty rounds; seeing the two demons dead, the Old Daoist was greatly troubled; he wondered why Zhongli Quan held the firefly bottle without sending forth the fireflies. Seeing he was near exhaustion, he called out, “Zhongli Quan, why do you not use the treasure?” Then Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, “Your harmful thing can hardly be called a treasure; look at my real treasure.” As he spoke, he opened his mouth and suddenly ten thousand beams of crystal light pressed upon the Old Daoist, enclosing him with a shining pearl of wondrous radiance. The Old Daoist was enveloped and felt discomfort, unable to discern direction, and thought to escape by Earth Flight. At that moment, the true Zhongli Quan leapt into the air and dropped the mud lump upon the Old Daoist’s head. As the lump fell to the ground, it suddenly spread, enclosing the Old Daoist within. The Old Daoist thought it was common earth, and entered it; in a moment he disappeared from sight. Zhongli Quan quickly descended, calling out, “Master, how did you let this demon escape?” Fei Changfang, having slain the rabbit, stood aside watching the battle, stamping his foot, “Alas! Alas! The cruel and villainous thief has escaped.” Only Immortal Maiden He smiled faintly, saying nothing.

Master Iron Crutch laughed, “Where is the treasure I gave you?” Zhongli Quan said, “What treasure? The mud lump? Was it not just thrown upon the old demon’s head? In a moment it spread, and the old demon vanished. Where he went, none know.” Master Iron Crutch smiled and pointed to where Zhongli Quan had thrown the mud lump. Suddenly a great mass of mud rolled together from all sides, and in the twinkling of an eye formed a large round ball. From the midst rose a round thing, wailing and begging for mercy. They all hurried to look, greatly amazed and laughing.

What this may be, or why it is enclosed in the mud ball, shall be explained in the next chapter.
