# Chapter 48: The Flesh of Lady Jiang Transformed into Silver Fish — The Pavilion of Meng Po Detains the Dragon Soul

Now it happened that Master Iron Crutch exercised his magical arts and first gathered the scattered flesh of Lady Meng Jiang into a mass, then divided it again, transforming it into countless slender and pure white little fish, which all together nodded to Master Iron Crutch and dispersed. Master Iron Crutch then stretched forth his right arm, opening his palm over the water in a gesture as if to scoop something up; immediately a faint and almost imperceptible white vapour flew into his palm. Hastily he closed his hand to secure it, then opened his gourd and placed the gathered white vapour inside, smiling he said, "Now at last I have solved a certain case. Let us return hence." The Immortal Maiden and Tonghui inquired eagerly, "What is the use of this?" Master Iron Crutch laughed and said, "Do you not yet understand? This is the chaste soul of Lady Meng Jiang, which I have enclosed in this gourd. Once within, it instantly resumes human form, differing not at all from the original body. Having obtained this soul, I must send it to the nether world, bidding it descend once more to the mortal realm, to begin early the cultivation of the Great Way. As for her husband, Fan Qiliang’s soul-spirit, when we first arrived here, other ghost officials had already dispatched him to the underworld."

Hearing this, the two were exceedingly glad, and asked further about the reason why her flesh was transformed into fish. Master Iron Crutch replied, "This is of no great consequence; it is merely out of pity for her unfortunate fate and respect for her chastity. Since the person is already dead and the soul is to be reincarnated, what use is there for scattered flesh? Let us keep a small memorial. First, it manifests that Lady Meng Jiang may not only attain immortality in the next life, but also that in this life she remains forever undying; secondly, so that all who in future generations see these fish will know them to be the transformed remains of Lady Meng Jiang. Because of this memorial to her, it may also serve as a warning to all later generations to strive to be chaste wives. This is my way of making use of what is left over to chide the world, and it has little real bearing upon Lady Meng Jiang herself."

Both exclaimed, "Lady Meng Jiang, a woman who died to preserve her husband’s memory and loyalty, receiving such a commendation, her renown can endure through the ages, becoming a model praised by countless women. Surely this is of great consequence." Master Iron Crutch nodded and said, "That is also true. You two may consider giving these fish a name, one neither strange nor dull, but deeply fitting to their form and nature." Tonghui smiled and said, "I am not so careful; we should ask Uncle He to think of one." The Immortal Maiden modestly paused, then said, "These fish are pure white as silver, and silver is a precious substance, befitting Lady Meng Jiang. Shall we call them Silver Fish?" Hearing this, the two applauded and praised the name. Now in various regions there are such Silver Fish, their fame transmitted through the ages, all knowing they were transformed from the remains of Lady Meng Jiang by immortal arts. Later, Lü Dongbin attained the Tao and traveled to the Xiang River, where he used wood shavings to create Silver Fish to supply a group of workers for food; within this is also a tragic history, to be told later and not now.

To speak only of Master Iron Crutch’s return to his dwelling, he delivered the soul records of Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qiliang to the Netherworld. The two, though dead, had deep affection, and before the Nether King they wept and begged to continue as husband and wife in the next life. The Nether King kindly said, "Your marriage in the former life was not consummated; the bond of fate remains for the next life. There is no need to petition, you will naturally be united as lovers. But since Master Iron Crutch has delivered you here, it is with deeper intent, and perhaps there is another reason to cultivate you. Mortal life at most lasts a hundred years; the time when husband and wife are most harmonious is but twenty years or so. How much better to break free from the bonds of passion, to enter the company of immortals, to be husband and wife forever, meeting through ten thousand years—how beautiful that is! You both are intelligent; can you not see this? Nowadays all mortals grow weary of the world of men, and bitterly seek true immortals, hoping to obtain some elixir of immortality; yet in millions of people, only two or three succeed. Even your present adversary, Qin Shi Huang, with all his power and fortune, daily speaks of seeking immortality and visiting the Way. What comes of it? Merely a few demons and devils, making strange uproar for a while and then passing away. The end is uncertain longevity at best; often a short life that does not reach its natural close. Thus it is indeed a great blessing from Heaven to be born with the fate of immortality. You have merited this not by great功德 (merit), but by the one point of Lady Meng Jiang’s chastity moving the immortals to compassion and exceptional care. Even Fan Qiliang has benefited; this is what millions and emperors cannot obtain. Do you still begrudge your one or two decades of marital happiness?"

The two suddenly understood and bowed, saying, "We common folk have indeed been ignorant, seeing not this before, and not knowing that beyond the delivery of resentful souls by the immortal master there lies such great intention. We have received grace but failed to know it, and instead cling to worldly dust; truly we are ashamed. But now we fear that though the bond of husband and wife remains in the next life, if the passions of the former life are not extinguished and we are harmoniously matched, then who will come to awaken us to break the realm of sensuality? How shall we cultivate the Way then?"

The Nether King laughed heartily, "Ah, you are cunning in your entanglements! At first you wished to be husband and wife again, which was reasonable; now you change to the contrary, hoping to sever the union of phoenix and dragon. Would you have me hide in your bridal chamber, and when you are in harmony leap out to strike you with a cudgel?"

These words of the Nether King were most wittily and delicately spoken, causing all the judges, little ghosts, horse-face and ox-head demons, and even Fan Qiliang and his wife to burst out laughing. Then one judge stepped forward and reported, "I have a method by which the couple will not lose their original truth; as soon as they are born they will know the affairs of their former lives. If they truly take vows and become monks, they may cultivate from childhood, with no need for others to awaken them, and so avoid missteps. But if their worldly hearts are not dead and their former feelings not forgotten, then it is they who abandon their blessings. I will have the great king lead us to haunt their bridal bed every day, and even then there will be moments of neglect; yet they may still enjoy the pleasures of fish and water in comfort. What say your majesty?"

The Nether King smiled and asked, "What is your plan?" The judge said, "It is not so much a plan as a rule. Those who are to be reborn in the world must pass by a pavilion where there is a soul-forgetting soup. The souls, weary and thirsty, must drink a cup, and immediately become confused, forgetting all about their former lives. Yet many souls are stubborn and refuse to drink, though they suffer thirst intolerably, their viscera burning; when they see such refreshing and palatable soup, they cannot but take a sip. From ancient times to the present, countless millions have been reborn, but none can recall their former lives, because no soul can endure the burning thirst. Now your majesty wishes to preserve Lady Meng Jiang and her husband; let them first drink their fill here, so that when they go thence they will not be parched, and having passed this pavilion, will not suffer the burning thirst of rebirth."

Before the Nether King could reply, another clerk laughed and said, "This will not do. The matter of reincarnation must have rules. If after eating their fill of soup they may forgo the soul-forgetting soup, then surely many would cheat. Who would wish to forget their former lives completely? How then do we hear so few who can remember their former life?"

The Nether King nodded, "True, this is indeed a great matter, and must have rules. But I think there must be some way of concession. Since the immortals have thus favoured them, I too must bestow special grace and think of some method." Then he gently said to Lady Meng Jiang and her husband, "You may withdraw for now. When a method is found, you shall be summoned again." The couple bowed and departed.

According to old custom in the Nether, all souls not yet assigned to reincarnation are provided with apartments in the palace, like the apartments for common people in the world. But whereas worldly apartments are set up by the people in groups, these dwellings are prepared by the palace itself, showing the Nether’s kindness to the souls of the good. This is mere trifling, no need to say more.

Suffice it to say, Lady Meng Jiang and her husband dwelt in these apartments for many days. One day suddenly the Nether King dispatched someone to summon them, saying, "The great king has devised a method for you; quickly come to the hall to await instructions." The two rejoiced greatly, and followed the ghost officials to the hall. The Nether King smilingly said, "Now a fortunate event has occurred. The old woman who was in charge of the soul-forgetting soup was dismissed for neglect of duty, and is seeking a suitable soul to replace her. By chance, your respected aunt, the mother of Qiliang, knowing your misfortune, cried and vomited blood and died. I pity her unjust death and find her loyal and kind; in her youth she once preserved the honour of another, accruing great功德 (merit), so by right she should have an office. Now she is appointed to manage this pavilion. Though busy, it is a position of importance, and besides, it is an opportunity to arrange your affairs. Is this not well?"

Hearing that their mother had died for them, their hearts were moved to tears; and because their own affairs were now settled, and their elder had obtained a post in the Nether, their grief turned to joy. They thanked the Nether King. The Nether King then summoned the soul of Meng Po to meet with them. Mother and children reunited after death, and naturally embraced and wept bitterly, so that the Nether King, judges, and ghost officials were moved to sympathy. Meng Po said angrily, "The wicked foolish king has destroyed my whole family. When my time comes, I shall surely seek revenge and vent our grievances." The Nether King smiled, "Qin Shi Huang was cruel and unkind, poisoning the world; he will soon come here. His sins in life will not be diminished after death; he will be judged according to the severity of his offenses, enough to satisfy your anger."

The three thanked once more. The Nether King gave gentle instructions, then bade them depart, ordering the ghost officials not to restrict them. After Meng Po took office, she might bring her son and daughter-in-law to their place; whenever they reincarnate, they may choose their own times. Now the pavilion of soul-forgetting had no master, only several clerks. Meng Po knew where to reside, so she entered with her daughter-in-law and dwelt there one day, then in due course formally took office.

From that time forth, Meng Po became the mistress of this pavilion, managing the soul-forgetting soup. Hence it is said Meng Po Pavilion, the origin of the name.

Since Meng Po took this office, Lady Meng Jiang and Fan Qiliang dwelt in the pavilion, naturally free from thirst and needing no soul-forgetting soup. Meng Po was loath to part with them, and so kept them there a long time. Later the Nether King learned of this and ordered the ghost officials to hasten their reincarnation. Lady Meng Jiang was reborn in Linhuai town in Jiangnan, in a family surnamed Wang, and named Yueying; Fan Qiliang was reborn in Jiangnan in a family surnamed Lan, named Caihe. Both families were of good lineage. The mothers were pregnant for eighteen months without delivery, causing great alarm and the belief of a demon fetus. When born, one was a boy, the other a girl, both exceedingly fair and beautiful.

More joyous still, before birth both mothers dreamed of a lame immortal carrying an iron staff, at the end of which hung a small gourd, accompanied by two female immortals. The lame immortal said to the mothers, "You will bear children of great foundation, destined to benefit your families. You must cherish and protect them carefully, never slighting them. To the family of the boy, when he marries, seek a bride born in the same year, month, and day; this girl’s surname is Wang, from Jiangnan; remember this well, for a wrong match will bring great calamity. To the family of the girl, her husband must be a Lan from Jiangbei, born the same year, month, and day."

Both mothers told their husbands and parents-in-law of the dream. Within half a day, both gave birth, and a strange fragrance filled their rooms without cease. More strange still, the children spoke immediately after birth, calling their parents “father” and “mother.” The neighbours were amazed and spread the tale. The two families lived but a river apart in a populous place, with daily ferry crossings; such strange happenings and the prominence of both families soon became widely known. Each family sent people across the river to investigate the other’s affairs, and found the coincidences true. Through introductions, they brought the children to meet. At sight of each other, the children showed great joy, clasped each other’s small hands and would not let go. The boy said, "Sister, we have met again." The girl shyly smiled and said, "Brother, let us not forget the immortal master’s instructions." These words exactly matched their mothers’ dreams, and all knew the marriage was truly predestined by Heaven. More wondrously, the families were well matched in status, and so they arranged the betrothal, enlisting a matchmaker to unite them on the day of the full moon. Their future will be told later.

Now Master Iron Crutch had delivered the soul records of Meng and Fan to the Nether, and at their rebirth, by means of dreams, personally accompanied by Immortal Maiden He and Tonghui, he enlightened them. Upon returning, he then related to them the affairs of their former lives.

Whether these two in their former lives were who or what, and why they suffered such tragic fate, will be explained in the next chapter.
