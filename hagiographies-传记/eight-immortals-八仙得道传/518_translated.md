# Chapter Fifty: Chastising the Tyrant—Sawing the Great Tree in the Moon; Pitying the Former Lord—The Spirit Mansion is the Pass of Affection

It is said that the Master Iron Crutch related how Hou Yi was trapped and detained, and spoke some words stubborn and unyielding, yet subtle and reasonable. The assembly quickly inquired, "How then did Elder Wu reply to him?" The Master Iron Crutch smiled and said, "Why all this haste? Consider, the Star Lord of the Moon Mansion is a celestial immortal of extraordinary wit and quickness; how need he be put to questioning? He is already prepared with words to meet all inquiries. In the book above, the Star Lord is reported as having thus explained to Wu Gang such and such matters, which indeed include these very words."

Then Master Iron Crutch proceeded to relate: "Presently, Wu Gang smiled and answered Hou Yi, saying, 'Do not boast and be perverse, slandering the Star Lord. Frankly, our Star Lord—what is her rank, what her divine power? How many Great Luo Golden Immortals have bowed before her, prostrating themselves with reverence? The Queen Mother of the West at the Jade Pool is the leader of the immortals; the Primordial Lord Lao is the ancestor of immortals. Even they, on seeing the Princess, do not presume to assume the airs of superiority—this you well know. With such great power and majesty, is she afraid of a mere petty wretch like you? Moreover, the Moon Mansion is a place of pure seclusion; how many unblessed immortals lack the fortune even to visit here? Because the Princess is the most lofty and pure person among all beings—heavenly or mortal, ancient or modern. Common immortals cannot even behold her; nay, not only can they not see her, they are not permitted even to set foot upon the smallest plot of the Moon Palace. This too you know. Would she raise such a small disturbance for you, a wretch, and then go to the Heavenly Court to petition the Jade Emperor, dispatch generals and troops, and marshal forces against you? No need to speak of such a fuss; even if a host of heavenly soldiers were stationed here for a moment, the Princess would not endure it. She does not lightly use arms; would she come herself, and contend with such a creature as you by speech and magic? Would that not be a greater disgrace to her dignity? There are many difficulties; only in desperation could she devise some small stratagem to lure you here and assign you this task. But what you say about the Princess coaxing you, that is not correct. The Princess did not issue a decree to entice you to saw this tree, thinking thereby to win merit and make amends. Did you not yourself declare that you came voluntarily, obedient to the order? Now the work has not begun; the Princess fears you will start but not finish, sawing halfway, then growing weary, and that you, having newly acquired the art of flight, might suddenly abandon the task and fly off to the Lower Realms. Then the tree would be left half-sawn, with bark and bone still intact, the Sahpa tree. Think what an unsightly sight that would be! Having thought it over again and again, you are a wild creature; gentle entreaties avail not with you. The only way is to use immortal magic to bind you temporarily. For now, say no more; so long as you diligently saw the tree, when it falls, that will be the moment you regain your freedom, and the day your wife and you descend to the mortal world. The Princess has indeed kept faith with you from beginning to end. Where is the deceit in that?'

Hou Yi heard this and said nothing. At first he was angry, unwilling to begin work; but afterwards he thought, 'The basket of wine and food hangs on the treetop; if I do not saw down the tree, the basket cannot come down. Looking at it this way, there is no other tea or food to be had; when hunger comes upon me, I will not endure it. I must therefore put forth all my strength and saw the tree down, then demand my Chang’e back from her. Since she prides herself on her faithfulness, surely she will not create further difficulties?' Thus he resolved to suppress his anger, and exerted his utmost strength to saw this Sahpa tree. Though the trunk was large, it could not withstand Hou Yi’s innate divine force; his two arms alone were sufficient to break it, much less with the aid of such a tool. In a few hours he had cut it through; the treetop fell down, but strangely the trunk tilted outward, while the food basket slipped inward and swiftly came into Hou Yi’s hand. Looking at the basket, it was only slightly larger than a fist, and the wine and food within—could they withstand Hou Yi’s gaping mouth swallowing at will?

By this time, Hou Yi’s hunger fire burned fiercely, unbearable. Seeing this scene, he was both angry and sorrowful; angry that the Star Lord had a mind to mock him, sorrowful that he could not satisfy his belly. He thought, 'What use is such trifling food? I had intended to throw it away, but its fragrance and sweetness are unlike ordinary fare, truly delicious. I cannot but have my mouth water, flowing in streams.'

He thought further, 'Since the work is done, and the matter settled, why quarrel and fret? Now I have good wine and food; I may as well eat it first, then go find Elder Wu Gang. I fear not that he will fail to complete the required ceremony.' So he poured out the wine and drank heartily, and ate of the rice. Strange to say, another marvel occurred: the empty basket again filled with wine and rice. Hou Yi joyfully said, 'So this basket has such wondrous properties! When I see Elder Wu Gang again, I must beg him to grant it to me as a gift.' With this he plumped out his belly and ate three hundred and fifty baskets in succession, then felt completely sated and comfortable. The basket remained full as before, still laden with fresh sweet white rice and a bottle of fragrant good wine. Hou Yi laughed and said, 'A fine thing indeed! Carrying this about, I can travel through the ten provinces and three islands without fearing lack of food; truly a wonderful thing.'

Before he finished speaking, the basket suddenly slipped from his hand, and with a whoosh returned to its place on the treetop. Hou Yi was startled. While hesitating, suddenly he heard a rushing wind; the tree shadows scattered and flickered before his eyes, dazzling him. Sawdust on the ground was swept up by the wind and blown into his eyes. Hou Yi hastily closed them for a while, inwardly reproaching the suddenness of the wind. After a time, the wind ceased and all was silent. Opening his eyes, he cried out bitterly. The place where the tree had been sawed was again joined, trembling and standing upright in mid-air, soaring high into the clouds. Not only was there no sign of the cut, but even the sawdust that had fallen was nowhere to be found. At this, Hou Yi was exceedingly sorrowful, yet dared not curse the Star Lord. He only rued that he had been taught to fly, and deceived into charging into the Moon Palace by devils, causing him great suffering. Long bound to the mortal state, he knew not the potency of celestial magic. Since he boasted himself a Golden Immortal of Heaven, how could he not know the laws of the Moon Palace? The Star Lord with a casual play of power had left him in a state neither living nor dead, unable to advance or retreat. The devil, having no means to overcome others, and not personally aiding him, had led him into this great snare—was this not malicious intent? Thinking thus, he wished to fly at once to the mortal world, and shoot the devil three or four hundred times, tearing his flesh and skin, to vent his anger.

After some anger, he was stupefied for a while. Observing the darkening sky, his ignorant stomach and inexperienced intestines failed to sympathize with their suffering master, and began to rumble and clamor, making Hou Yi exceedingly uncomfortable. He thought, 'They share weal and woe with me; I cannot bear to see them suffer. But short of sawing the tree, though the food is fine, it cannot come down.' Helpless, he sighed deeply, bowed his head, and resumed the same game. Only when the tree was cut through again did the basket come down as before, giving him wine to drink and food to eat, and he was greatly satisfied. The basket again filled with wine and rice, and rolled back in the usual direction. Suddenly Hou Yi thought to hold the severed trunk firmly, not letting it freely rejoin. But no sooner was the thought formed than a wild wind arose, stronger than before. Besides sawdust, sand and gravel were added, blinding Hou Yi’s eyes so that he could scarcely open them, tears streaming ceaselessly. This tumult lasted two or three hours. Hou Yi, being hot-tempered, suffered great pain in his eyes, wishing he had a knife to gouge out his eyeballs. At last all was calm, the tears ceased, no pain nor itching remained, and the wind’s noise was gone. He dared to open his eyes and found, to his great fury, that the twice-severed tree had again rejoined, towering to the clouds, unreachable. The food basket hung high on the treetop, like a watermelon growing from the tree, swaying in the wind, yet still amusing. This left Hou Yi dumbfounded, like a carved figure, unable to move for a long time. Seeing no way out, he endured, still holding on. Later he devised a plan: when the basket came down, he would not eat, but first press down the severed tree. Strange to say, the tree seemed to be enchanted; whenever Hou Yi touched it, a great wind rose immediately, nearly blinding him. Yet in the end, the basket hung as before, the cut tree rejoined as before. Though Hou Yi was vexed, his belly knew no reasoning, his intestines no wisdom; hunger and thirst tormented him; he must eat, he must saw the tree. Thus it went on and on. After two days, Hou Yi’s heart settled, resolved to be a long-term humble worker, no longer dreaming of usurping imperial power or grand designs.

Two days in Heaven passed, but months in the mortal world. At this time, a poor kingdom lost its king, and chaos reigned in the court. The gods and spirits of the kingdom reported to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor found that Hou Yi was now with the Princess; and learned that this man, having held office for over five hundred years, had by his misgovernance brought disaster upon the people, and his tenure was revoked; shortly he was to be slain by his ministers. He commanded Venus, the Golden Star, to convey a message: the body of Hou Yi was to be returned to endure the retribution of being slain by his ministers. As for his soul, it might remain in the Moon Palace, condemned to eternal toil sawing the tree, in place of the punishment of the nether world. Until the sufferings he endured equalled his sins, he was forbidden to be reborn elsewhere.'

Here Master Iron Crutch paused, and the author begged leave to interject a few words, to inform the reader to heed carefully. The story of Hou Yi’s flight into the Moon Palace and all that followed is now told. Many scientists, geographers, and explorers assert that the moon, like other planets, has peoples, cities, and institutions. Yet according to the Chinese tradition of thousands of years, the Moon is governed by the Star of the Great Yin who presides over its affairs. There is one who there saws with a saw the great Sahpa tree, cutting and yet rejoining as he cuts. The basket of food hangs on the tree top; when cut it descends, when joined it ascends. This accords perfectly with what is told in this book. Yet the storytellers of tradition, being ignorant, mistake Chang’e for the Great Yin Star Lord, and know not who the sawyer is, nor why he suffers so. Since the advent of new learning and new theories, such ancient tales have been dismissed as superstition. Learned scholars, unable to find evidence of the moon’s reality, must needs adapt new learning, asserting communication with the moon, and that most moon conditions are ideal. Whether this be so, none dare affirm. In the author’s opinion, many ancient Chinese traditions verge on philosophy; foreign teachings mostly belong to science. The two have often diametrically opposed views. Yet studied closely, is there not reason to be found? For example, lightning strikes: scientists say it is electric shock, a reasonable account. But according to this book, lightning is governed by heavenly spirits. Otherwise, why have the tales persisted that all struck dead by lightning are evil men and fiends, and never upright gentlemen? Though this claim is also somewhat dogmatic, staunch atheists have no better evidence to offer for study. Since this is so for lightning, the moon’s conditions may be viewed similarly. The author suspects that Xu Fu, when he crossed the sea and encountered immortals, established a state and population there. Before Xu Fu's arrival, could the people of that land be other than immortal beings? If not, why do immortals have sovereignty to grant that land to Xu Fu? By this example, perhaps the future Moon Palace, like the ancient sea kingdom, is granted by the Great Yin Star Lord to humans as a colony. Perhaps she, fond of purity and brilliance, cannot bear to sever it, and forbids human approach. These are matters still hard to predict or speak of. To accept the word of a few explorers and assert that the moon is like the earth, inhabited by humans with no immortals coming or going, is as unconvinced as denying spirits in lightning. Enough of idle talk; too much is unpleasant. Let us hasten to the main narrative.

Master Iron Crutch said, 'The Jade Emperor commanded the Great Yin Star Lord to detain Hou Yi’s soul and release his body to suffer punishment in the mortal realm. The Star Lord naturally obeyed. Imagine a man bereft of soul—what good deeds can he perform? Hou Yi returned to his country as a madman or fool. Soon he was killed by Han Zhuo, powerless to resist. With Hou Yi’s death, half his offences were expiated, and by rule he should enter the nether tribunal to receive punishment. The Jade Emperor, however, granted special favour: to remain in the Moon Palace to endure five thousand years’ torment, then be restored to heavenly rank, returning to the retinue of the Black Tiger Star. This was the best outcome. Yet Hou Yi was a man of great licentiousness; though his soul was detained, his mind remained foolishly attached, still longing for Chang’e. Whenever she came to the garden to pick flowers, sweep bamboo, or roam hills and waters, he would wail and call, his voice heard far and near. At first Chang’e paid no heed, but as time passed and feelings changed, men often forget past enmities and remember benefits; how much more so was Chang’e, a gentle and sincere woman. Hearing such piteous cries, though Hou Yi had a thousand faults, he had not a day without good. Now that his soul was confined in the Moon Palace, enduring blazing sun and scorching rain, wind and frost—this was all for his own sake. Having become an immortal herself, she had suffered not a jot of his bitterness, but had in fact been benefited by his endurance. Yet he bore the pain for her; the past days were nothing, but how could he endure the thousand years to come? Moreover, Hou Yi’s wailing, whether the Star Lord heard it or not, was news among her sisterhood, who mocked Chang’e, saying she had heartlessly harmed her husband, and should have compassion and plead for relief before the Star Lord. Such mockery was painful to her. For these two reasons, Chang’e’s heart unconsciously grew tender for Hou Yi.'

At this point, the listening goddesses sighed toward each other, saying, 'The most inscrutable thing in the world is this matter of affection. Pity, pity!' Zhongli Quan, being young and unversed in worldly ways, laughed suddenly and said, 'You two are women at heart, more tender than we men. Be cautious, Master here has said that Chang’e has taken pity, though not the ending, it is foreseen she will descend to the mortal world. Perhaps she is the former incarnation of Meng Jiangnu, none can say. Since you are so compassionate, if anyone comes to you with sweet words of love, you may also pity their devotion and soften your hearts. Then Master will be unable to help you!'

At these words, Zhang Guo and Fei Changfang were struck dumb, while the goddesses Xian Gu and Tong Hui snorted coldly, their faces flushing with anger.

Master Iron Crutch hurriedly rebuked, 'Children who know not the matter dare not rashly judge others. Especially with women, speech must be cautious. Your words just now were utterly frivolous and shameless. Such is unacceptable to others, much more so to your own senior brothers and fellow disciples. Such careless speech shortens life and lessens merit according to immortal law. This is your self-inflicted blame and loss, no concern of others. Be more careful next time, or I shall not dare to meet you.' These words made Zhongli Quan sweat profusely and fall prostrate. The goddesses, seeing this, took each a hand and helped him up, laughing. Zhongli Quan apologized repeatedly to the two. Master Iron Crutch comforted them and then continued, 'Just now Ah Quan guessed that Chang’e is the former life of Meng Jiangnu; this guess is indeed correct. Chang’e, on one hand, pities Hou Yi; on the other, to stop his wailing, secretly entertains the thought of meeting him again. But her heart is timid and fearful, and she dares not go openly. When one has thoughts of love and affection, these grow day by day, hard to escape. When passion reaches its height, however great the danger, one may rashly attempt an encounter. Chang’e’s heart is thus impure. At first, her timidity and shallow feeling allowed her to restrain herself; now, after more than a year, her heart has grown warmer. Though she dares not visit openly, she frequents places near him more often than before. Sometimes she even comes beneath the Sahpa tree, pretending to watch him work. When Hou Yi sees her, he treasures her as a precious thing, his words full of self-pity and grief. At the height of emotion, he would pause work, raise his palm like a large fan, and beat his body desperately. This distressed Chang’e greatly. At first she tried to soothe him with words; later she wept for him. From then on they met day and night, all past grudges were forgiven. Hou Yi asked her to find a way to rescue him. Chang’e, blaming her low status and position, dared not agree outright; yet her heart was anxious for him, wishing to find an opportunity to test the Star Lord’s temper and reason further. But before such chance came, she herself fell into great trouble.'

Master Iron Crutch said to this, the quick-tongued Zhongli Quan could not help but laugh and say, 'The Star Lord must know of this and certainly disapprove of her.'

What great trouble Chang’e had wrought remains to be told in the next chapter.
