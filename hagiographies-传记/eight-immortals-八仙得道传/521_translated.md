# Chapter 53: Fei Changfang, in Wrath, Opens the Slaughter; The God Erlang Descends to Suppress Violence

Now it happened that Fei Changfang, seeing his own wife so insulted and affronted by a band of scoundrels, was seized by a fire raging in his very vitals, and the three corpses spirits within him leapt violently. He beheld the villains drag Madam Bai away; her hair was dishevelled, her feet bare, and her garments torn beyond recognition. She cried aloud, "Help! Robbers seize a woman! Help, good people of the place!" Her voice was pitiful and urgent, grievous to hear.

Fei Changfang could endure no longer; observing that Bai had been dragged some hundred paces away, he employed his art of shrinking the earth beneath his feet, and in a single leap was among them. The crowd, beholding this man appear out of empty air, were full of wonder and suspicion, half believing him a spirit or demon. Fei Changfang spoke not at length, but first inquired of his wife: "Dost thou yet recognise thy humble servant?" Bai, seeing Fei’s guise and dress, and noting his countenance less youthful than in days past, clearly knew him to be her husband, yet a doubt arose within her heart, for many years had passed since their separation; reports had long circulated that he was dead in a foreign land. Now he appeared suddenly, unbidden, as if by some strange chance; or, might it be that he was a ghost returned upon knowledge of her distress, manifesting to save her? At first she saw him not lurking anywhere, and yet instantly he stood before her. Such thoughts made the latter explanation more credible. Since he was her husband, though a ghost, she was not afraid, but seized his robe, and wept aloud, lamenting to heaven and earth: "Thou art surely one long dead; how comest thou here? Is it that thou hast knowledge of thy wife’s peril, and comest to rescue her in spirit?" Fei Changfang answered but once: "Speak not idle words; how canst thou prove I am a ghost?"

Before he had finished speaking, the band pressed forward, demanding: "Art thou man or ghost, or some demon? Even if thou art a spirit, thy wife hath broken the law, and we prepare to deliver her to the magistrate. Thou livest in the nether world, and hast no dealings with us in the living realm; we advise thee meddle no further. If thou dost not desist, we will seize thee first, and bring thee before the City God’s temple, charging thee with the great crime of falsely claiming another’s wife. How wilt thou escape as a harmless spirit?"

Fei Changfang, already wrathful as thunder, grew yet more enraged at these words; drawing his sword, he bade the speaker: "Accursed villain! In broad daylight to ravish a married woman, and then to confound the living with ghosts! I will show you the power of a true spectre." With a flourish of his sword, the man’s head fell lightly to the ground. The villains shouted in alarm, "From whence comes this wild Daoist, who slays a man?" and rushed forward to seize Fei Changfang. Pushing Bai aside, he again employed shrinking earth, and was half a mile away ere the fight began. These ruffians, used only to acting in numbers to oppress and prey upon the village, knew naught of swordsmanship; unarmed, they confronted Fei Changfang with many hands. Furious beyond measure, he disregarded all restraint, wielding sword in wild arcs; in an instant six or seven lay slain, and the five remaining fled, all wounded. Fei Changfang laughed aloud: "Base slaves! Had I known you would lack spirit to fight, why have you wrought such mischief?" He pursued them, and with a shout bade them halt. Their feet were fixed as if nailed to the earth, unable to move. Fei Changfang said: "You scoundrels, to spare your lives is itself a curse upon the land. Better that I expend more effort, and send you all to the nether world, there to meet the City God, who will dispatch men to arrest me and punish my crime." Saying so, he raised his sword and smote two more in succession. Though their feet were bound, their minds remained clear, and they cried aloud for mercy: "Great Immortal, spare our lives; we shall no longer transgress." Fei Changfang laughed: "Do you know what it is to be without evil? Who trusts empty words?" Then he slew another, leaving but two. They wept and entreated: "Great Immortal, be merciful and compassionate, and mindful of salvation. Our crimes are at worst robbery of women; surely not deserving death. Thou hast slain many of our brothers; spare us, and mitigate thy wrath, that we may live a few days yet." Their tears flowed profusely.

Fei Changfang, hearing this, recalled the teaching of the Master Iron Crutch, and judged that these two spoke truly. He had acted excessively; in his wrath had slain many unjustly, seeming to wield magic to oppress the common folk. Moreover, to use a precious sword against unarmed men was neither martial nor humane. His heart repented, and he cast down his sword, speaking bitterly: "Years of cultivation are less than a moment of violence. I know not what enmity lies between us to drive me so."

Having spoken, he saw the two still entreating, and, cast down, said: "I will spare you. Live henceforth uprightly, and do not again disturb the village. If you do, though I spare you, the law and Heaven’s way will not exempt you. Begone!"

The two, saved, bowed and fled like mice. Fei Changfang, in wrath, had slain many; his thoughts turned from anger to sorrow. Bewailing himself, he lingered long, then picked up his sword, listless, and went forward to seek his wife.

Suddenly came a shout from behind: "Where goes the murderer?" Fei Changfang turned, and saw a white-robed Daoist riding a white elephant, rushing like a gale. Knowing escape impossible, and despairing, he boldly prepared to face death. He halted, awaiting the Daoist’s approach; as he neared, Fei lifted hand in greeting: "Whence cometh the Daoist? Pray, what is thy sacred name?"

The Daoist laughed coldly: "Thou rude barbarian, knowest thou manners? We monks hold mercy as our root. Such acts as thine — not only revenge excessive, but defiance of law and Heaven’s decree — are utterly unworthy. Thou, relying on petty arts, oppressing unarmed, lawless common folk, dost disgrace our Daoist order. Magic is meant to save and succour; to kill, unless for great criminals whom law cannot touch, and who harm the land, is forbidden save in rare necessity, and even then the fewest deaths are preferred. To slay many is to wound Heaven’s harmony; how much more to trample human life, and tenfold so! Such cruelty among ordinary men deserves death; how much more among practitioners of the Way, who abuse its powers so? Such conduct would, if unchecked, lead all skilled in magic to slay all mankind. We Daoists would become the executioners of the world. If this evil should flourish, the Daoist faith will perish."

Fei Changfang, filled with shame and remorse, dared not reply. The Daoist continued: "As to thy case: seeing thy wife insulted, thine anger was natural. And thy claim that they are all evil men, so that slaying them removes a plague, seems reasonable. Yet know that when folk offend the law, it is the magistrate’s charge to redress. We who live apart from the world have no right to meddle in affairs of state. Were it so that all Daoists had power to intervene, why then erect magistrates and emperors? If forced to involve ourselves, we should do good works. But to slay and pillage is not ours. Thou hast slain many, and then claim to rid the land of evil — such boast is shameless and groundless. Mark me: evil men have leaders, and others among them are coerced or enticed, or forced by necessity to act ill. When magistrates capture many thieves, they do not slay them all without inquiry. For not all are beyond redemption. Among evildoers too there is rank and degree; mercy and reform should be sought where possible. Thou hast shown no discrimination, but slain all alike. Thy master and his disciples rail against Emperor Qin for cruelty and oppression, even plotting his death; yet thy deeds are more cruel than his. I will speak with thy master, that he may bear some blame for such a pupil."

Fei Changfang, perceiving the reason and justice in the Daoist’s words, and that he knew all his affairs, judged him a celestial immortal of high rank. He felt powerless to resist, burdened with guilt, and feared bringing harm upon his master. No thought had he for his wife’s present plight, nor the cause of his family’s troubles. He prostrated himself before the Daoist, confessing: "I am become a sinner among the Daoists; I dare not face my master, and beg thy strict punishment to remit my guilt." The Daoist, Iron Crutch, sorrowed to see him thus. Bai, within the house, hearing her husband’s voice, peered from the door and, seeing him kneeling before the lame Daoist, knew her master had come. She threw down her work and ran forth, kneeling beside her husband, saying: "I am Bai, your disciple’s wife, and pay homage to the master; may the master’s life be boundless." Iron Crutch sat above, letting Fei kneel without reply. Seeing Bai, he rose and said: "Madam, a virtuous wife of steadfast chastity, we cannot receive such ceremony; pray rise."

Bai saw her husband still kneeling, and knew it was because so many had been slain. She too knelt without rising. Iron Crutch waved his hand lightly: "Rise, and we will talk." The couple stood aside, listening respectfully. Iron Crutch sighed: "All this is fated. Though thou canst endure all, if thou canst not bear insult, the path to Dao is very far. Erlang is a god of strict uprightness, yet full of chivalry. I have met with him concerning thee. Out of pity for thy innocent cause, and for thy wife’s sake, he appoints thee to office as a keeper of fierce spirits. Though alive, thy office is in the nether world. Now in these troubled times, many ghosts wander homeless, many are oppressed by stronger spirits. To be a lone soul is pitiable; how can it endure more wrong? Shouldst thou find such cases, thou must justly protect them. Also, those ghosts who harm the living must be expelled. All wandering souls ungoverned by the laws of the nether world shall be subject to thy rule. If thou govern justly, so that there be no unjust spirits nor ghostly mischief, this will be thy great merit, expiating today’s sins. But if thou abuse thy power, using Daoist arts to oppress ghosts or men, then thou shalt suffer double punishment: not only thunder and fire, but also the sword of Erlang shall be thy fate." Fei Changfang wept and vowed obedience.

Whether Iron Crutch trusted him or no, shall be told anon.

Fei Changfang then used shrinking earth to reach his wife’s place. As the district was thinly inhabited, he soon found her. The two spoke briefly of their separation. He withheld from her the tale of his misdeeds, and together they returned home. Inquiry was made into the cause of the disturbance. It appeared that Fei Changfang, having long ago entered the religious life and left no children, had his brother’s son inherit the estate. This nephew had been the one to open the door when the immortal He visited Fei last year. As a child he was decent, but as he grew older grew worse year by year, delighting in the company of bandits and in lawless deeds. Soon he squandered the entire estate, infuriating his parents till they sickened and died in succession. Madam Bai, though advanced in years, still retained some beauty. While Fei was at home, their conjugal love was strong; after his leaving the secular life, many friends urged her to remarry while still young, to avoid the bitterness of widowhood. Bai resolved to remain chaste, enduring all hardships, and so gained the respect of the district.

The unworthy nephew, having sold off the estate, hearkened to the instigations of others, who said: though his stepmother was old, many young maidens were not so fair as she; why not trick her out and sell her for money? At first he wavered, but poverty drove him to this. He gambled in the gaming-houses, hoping to win a sum to live on, then reform. But Heaven seemed to doubt his sincerity, and fortune did not favor him; he lost all and fell into debt, with evidence requiring repayment by a fixed date. Thus he dared not refrain from plotting against his stepmother. Though Hanyang had suffered war and fire, it being a former capital, the market was still busy and prosperous, and many houses of pleasure provided for the sons of noble families. Madam Bai, famed for her beauty, was long known as a local beauty. The nephew, resolved either not to sell or to sell her to a brothel for high price, quickly found a house willing to pay three hundred taels of silver for her. To ensure her consent, he sent many ruffians to her house, making disturbance, claiming he was under arrest and they would seize his mother to the magistrate.

Bai, a woman unlearned in these ways, was beguiled and went forth. As she passed the gate, the villains employed their arts to assault her, seeking pleasure, for she was famed and rare; none had seen her face easily. They never reckoned that Fei Changfang was then returning home, and so a great case arose at this narrow meeting. The villains’ hearts were not yet opened when their heads fell; indeed a very poor calculation. Fei Changfang, in his moment of wrath, had wrought this great calamity, losing hope in the Way and incurring punishment, uncertain when or how he might escape, and fearful of what penalty awaited. Moreover, though the family matter was investigated, Bai’s safety remained unresolved. The worthless nephew, hearing of his uncle’s return, dared not appear. Fei Changfang was full of remorse, and bore no anger against him; yet fearing the villains’ associates, the nephew hid abroad. Fei Changfang felt deep remorse and despair, and heard news: "The magistrate, receiving report from the local constable, says ten have been slain. Officers are dispatched to investigate and apprehend the culprit." Fei judged that none had seen him slay, for the place was remote and little frequented. Yet he feared his nephew’s evil designs; if he should accuse him, no escape would be possible. Though he might flee, he feared for Bai. Two days later, resolved, Fei prepared to seek his master, to confess the calamity and the punishment by Erlang, and ask for guidance.

Just as he was about to depart, a voice was heard in the air. Hastening to the corridor, he looked up and saw a lame Daoist descending from heaven — none other than his master, Iron Crutch. Fei felt both gratitude and shame, and bowed low, saying: "Master above, thy disciple is now a sinner among Daoists. I dare not face thee, but beg severe punishment to remit my guilt." Iron Crutch, moved by his state, was saddened. Bai, working within, hearing her husband’s voice, looked secretly through the door, and seeing him kneeling before the lame Daoist, knew her master had come. She left her work and ran forth, kneeling beside her husband, declaring herself disciple’s wife Bai, paying homage and wishing the master immortal life. Iron Crutch, seated above, let Fei kneel without reply. Seeing Bai, he rose and said: "Madam, a virtuous wife steadfast in chastity, such ceremony is needless; rise, rise."

Bai saw her husband yet kneeling, and knew it was for the many slain. She too knelt without rising. Iron Crutch waved his hand: "Rise, and we will speak." The couple stood to either side, respectfully listening. Iron Crutch sighed: "All this is predestined. Though thou canst endure all, if thou canst not bear insult, thy path to Dao is very distant. Erlang is a god of stern rectitude, yet filled with chivalry. I have met with him concerning thee. For pity of thy innocent cause, and for thy wife’s sake, he appoints thee an officer over mighty spirits. Though living, thou shalt serve as a netherworld official. Now in these chaotic times, many ghosts wander homeless, many oppressed by mightier spirits. To be a lone soul is dire enough; how can it endure further wrong? If thou findest such cases, thou shalt uphold their cause impartially. Moreover, ghosts who harm living folk must be driven away. All wandering souls ungoverned by nether laws shall be under thy jurisdiction. If thou govern justly, that no unjust ghosts vex men, and no ghostly harm befalls, this shall be thy great merit, and expiate today’s sins. But if thou abuse thy power, overbearing with Daoist arts, oppressing ghost or man, then thou shalt suffer double penalty. Neither thunder and fire, nor Erlang’s sword shalt thou escape." Fei Changfang wept, accepted the charge, and vowed no further error.

Whether Iron Crutch could trust him remains to be told.
