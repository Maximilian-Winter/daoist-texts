# Chapter 059: To Plot for Wealth One Must First Harm Life; In Saving the Master One Earns a Bad Name

Now it happened that Lan Xiu, although forcibly dragged into the house by his wife and thrust upon the bed, was inwardly filled with new anger and old grievances, stirred to rebellious spirit, and could not for the moment restrain himself. He reflected, “For three generations have they depended upon the Lan household for their livelihood; while Lan Wen was alive, he showed them favour and kindness. Now that he himself has died without justice, to be a servant in the world and not avenge him or redress his wrongs is contrary to conscience. Yet that is a thing of the past; and as I was previously unaware, it may be said I could not exert myself. But now there is before me a young master and young mistress, fallen from power and in danger of life; this matter has already plainly come to my ears. Now is the time to act before the event, and I may well make provision beforehand. If I do not warn them in advance, will I not become an accomplice with Hu Qian and his sister in their wickedness?”

After much thought, he felt there was no other way. Moreover, he feared Hu Qian was ruthless and quick in action. Should he strike at once, even if he hurried now it might be too late. How then could he delay? Thus, he made up his mind, feigning deep sleep, waiting until the household was all in slumber. Then he quietly drew himself up, slipped out, opened the door, and took the direct road to the Lan mansion. Though the distance was but half a li, his age and infirmity, his failing eyesight and weak feet, caused him to proceed slowly, step by step, for an hour before he reached the Lan residence. Being an intimate old man, he naturally knew well the situation at Lan’s. Yet he did not approach the main gate nor the back gate, but took a small side door on the west. The gatekeeper was none other than a nephew of Lan Xiu, no more than thirteen or fourteen years old this year. Lan Xiu took advantage of the boy’s ignorance, and went straight to him. The lad opened the side door, and seeing his uncle arrive so late, was greatly astonished. Lan Xiu forbade him to ask questions, and merely inquired where the young master was now living, and where also the young lady of the Wang family resided.

The boy was of a good heart, and hearing the question about the young master, answered mournfully: “Uncle, please do not mention the young master again, he suffers terribly now. Not to speak of other things, only his place of abode is a poor thatched hut behind the cattle shed. In the hut are only three boards and a bed, nothing else. The mistress said that all the herding of cattle and sheep should be done by the young master himself, so they let him live there for ease of management. Now you ask for him, would you not go and see him? But that place is behind the main hall, and to get there one must pass through the mistress’s chambers and several gates. Should the mistress or uncle be awakened, it would not be safe. It is better to see the young lady Wang, who lives nearer. She too suffers greatly, though somewhat less than the young master, and her lodging is much cleaner. The mistress says the young master and young lady are no longer children and should not dwell together, so they are kept apart by several courtyards. They are separated one from the other, and so it is not easy for the young master and young lady to meet. I hear the young master complains about this.”

Before he finished, Lan Xiu sharply rebuked him: “Children must not chatter! Lead me quickly to see Miss Wang.” The boy answered without delay, “That is easy; it is just before my room. Now all is quiet and deep in the night, and everyone within sleeps soundly. If uncle wishes to go, there is no need to disturb others, is that not so?” This pleased Lan Xiu greatly, and he praised the boy for his insight and reason, far above that of his cousin. The boy’s heart was lifted, and he led Lan Xiu to the window beneath the moonlight.

The boy used his forefinger to tap thrice upon the window, softly calling, “Miss Wang, are you awake? Your uncle Lan is here to see you.” At these words came a faint sigh from within, and a voice asked, “Is it not the old steward Lan?” Reader, take note: Miss Yueying, though degraded and insulted, as a lady of a noble chamber still preserved her dignity. At such a late hour, with all quiet and silence, a man’s sudden visit would be indeed alarming and strange. But this boy was very clever, and spoke at once that it was old Lan; this word caused those inside to lay aside much of their fear and wonder. Moreover, how came Yueying not to have slept soundly at such an hour, yet to awaken at the slightest call? It was because Yueying was devoted to her cultivation; at night’s stillness and at dawn she always sat in meditation for an hour. When the boy tapped, she had just finished her practice and was about to retire. She was a woman of exceeding wisdom, and having dwelt for years in the Lan mansion, she knew well the household’s affairs and personnel. She admired the old steward Lan the most. In this hour of life and death, she was ever watchful and alert, planning against misfortune. Hearing now that this long-unseen steward Lan had come at midnight, seeking none but herself, she had already guessed much before a word was spoken.

They exchanged words, and Yueying stepped down from her bed and peered through the lattice. There was indeed a dark-faced young servant holding up an old man, whose white hair was wrinkled and silver like crumpled silk, standing beneath the window. Yueying did not delay, but hastened to open the door. She came out herself, but would not let them enter her chamber. In the courtyard, under the bright moon, they spoke softly and secretly. Yueying asked, “Dear uncle, a midnight visit must surely bring ill tidings; is that so?” Lan Xiu, hearing this, was greatly startled, and prostrated himself, saying, “Mistress, have you also heard? Why then have you not made ready?”

Yueying was struck dumb for a moment, then answered, “I do not conceal from you, uncle, that Caihe and I truly have no news. What I just spoke was but a wild word caused by your strange conduct, and whether it be true or not I know not. But now hearing your words, it seems my wild guess was unhappily correct. Yet Caihe still knows nothing. Pray tell me, uncle, what has now occurred? I had already turned my heart away from the world. Though they are incompatible, it was a good opportunity for me to enter the Way, and I felt my virtue was not exhausted. What I fear is for Caihe alone. Alas! Alas! No need to speak further. Who could have called him… Ah, there is no need to linger on. Pray uncle, quickly tell me the news, so that I may notify Caihe and make provision against the storm.”

Lan Xiu sighed, and recounted all the evil plot arranged by the Hu siblings, and how he had come to know it. He thought Yueying would be greatly alarmed. But upon hearing, she remained calm and even smiled coldly, saying, “Oh, is that so! Then this may count as a fortunate misfortune for me. Pray, uncle, when have they fixed the day to carry out their design?” Lan Xiu said, “That I do not know. The boy says it will be within a day or two. I intended first to tell the young master, but who would have thought he was so daring as to treat the young master so cruelly and unjustly. Not to speak of other things, I could not see the young master today, and should I delay till tomorrow, I fear the villains may act at once. What can be done?”

As Yueying was about to speak, suddenly a laugh rang sharply from an alley. The three, master and servants, were greatly alarmed. Searching for the source of the laugh, they saw several black shadows swiftly emerge from a narrow path. In the moonlight they were plainly visible. The leader was the newly appointed uncle Hu Qian. Following him were three servants recently hired by him.

They came like a whirlwind to Yueying’s side. Hu Qian sneered, “What a young mistress not yet married, what a noble lady in the chamber, turned out to be a low woman who steals men’s favours like a servant wench. To have such a daughter-in-law at Lan’s is to have the family reputation swept away, and all dignity lost. Usually coy and coquettish, she bewitched her husband, seeming a proper woman; but now what is she? Surely caught red-handed, the truth laid bare, her disguise revealed. Very well! Since you are so shameless, I care not for Lan’s reputation. I shall send you to the authorities for trial.”

Having spoken, he turned to his three men and shouted, “Bind these adulterers and harlots quickly!” The three immediately raised fists and sleeves to seize, but did not yet know whom Hu Qian meant. Besides Yueying, there were old and young. The old was too old to be a paramour; the young too young to be a paramour. They whispered to one another. Hu Qian, hearing this, was momentarily stunned, then shouted, “Bind them all at once! I know who the adulterers are!”

The three advanced to seize. Lan Xiu and Yueying were naturally enraged, and shouted curses. The boy nephew, seeing his uncle wronged, and himself implicated, also angrily cursed Hu Qian’s villainy, declaring all his past rogueries and the many times he had come to Lan’s to beg for loans.

While this was spoken, Hu Qian’s feigned anger grew into real fury. He stamped his feet, clapped his hands, urging his men to strike. They advanced: one to guard Yueying, two to seize the old and the boy. But Lan Xiu and the boy had some strength left, and resisted. Hu Qian’s men were all low scoundrels, worn out by wine and women. Though seeming fierce, they were ineffectual. They had been half asleep, and on hearing voices thought them thieves, and had hastily called up three men lodging beneath Hu Qian’s chamber to come out. Seeing it was Yueying and company, they were overjoyed, but the three were still dazed from being dragged from bed, and did not understand the matter, stumbling about to seize, unprepared for resistance. The boy nephew, small in stature and unaware of consequences, reached out and grasped the kidney of one. It is said that to pinch a man’s kidney can be fatal.

In the urgency of the moment, he exerted great force on the man’s kidney and twisted it outward. The man cried out and fell backward. Hu Qian and the guard at Yueying cried out, “The boy has killed a man!” At that moment, Lan Xiu and the man who had been seized were evenly matched in combat. Hearing the cry of killing, they were also startled and ceased fighting, looking at the man lying on the ground.

Such a tumult had roused all in and without the household. From the new mistress Hu down to the menials, all dressed hastily and rushed forth. Even the disgraced young master Lan Caihe hurried out in confusion. Seeing Hu Qian gesturing and pointing as he reported to Mistress Hu, Caihe grasped from a word or two that Hu Qian was framing Yueying, and sought her out, weeping, “Sister, I have harmed you.” Yueying could only respond with moist eyes, glancing up and down at Caihe, wanting to weep yet unable, wishing to speak yet inarticulate.

The guard of Yueying, seeing Caihe and Yueying so affectionate, and angered and ashamed at being beaten so by Lan Xiu and the boy, vented his spite upon Caihe. Knowing Caihe by name a young master, but in truth less than a servant; Yueying a prisoner under his charge, he had no need to be circumspect. He glared, opened his eyes wide, and with both hands thrust out, shouting at Caihe, “Your wife steals men; how can you face her and cry with her?”

Before he finished, there came a slap, then two more. The man felt the blows and, startled, looked to see the first was from Caihe on the left, the next two from Lan Xiu on the right. Caihe cursed him as a bully; Lan Xiu called him a low brute. Hu Qian and his men came to aid the man, insulting Caihe. Caihe scolded Lan Xiu in return, threatening to slap him.

In the great courtyard, uproar rose, voices loud and unceasing. Hu Qian shouted to the crowd, “If you wish to eat here in this house, you must obey Mistress and me. Bind these three adulterers and harlots quickly, and send them to the county. Now they have killed a man, the crime is greater still. If you refuse, Mistress will cast each of you out of the house; you need not serve here.” He spoke several times, but the crowd looked at each other and would not move. The servants’ conscience was awake; they thought Hu Qian and his like were without reason. All had received kindness from the Lan family, and could not forsake conscience to commit this rebellion and lawlessness. Hu Qian grew angry and cursed at them wildly.

Lan Xiu saw the state of things and said quickly to Caihe and Yueying, “Young master, young lady, let us go. The world is wide; where shall we not find food? Let us leave this property to them. Though I am old, I would rather follow you to the ends of the earth and beg, than remain here to suffer daily insult and be plotted against.” Saying so, he took Yueying by one hand and Caihe by the other, and hurriedly fled. The boy nephew followed. The crowd dared not stop them, and the three passed out.

This angered Hu Qian sorely, and he roared like an ox. Returning to his room, he took up three heavy knives, clubs, and ropes, and called out his new servants, driving all out the main gate. In the moonlight, he saw Caihe and the others fleeing along the riverbank. Hu Qian commanded, “Seize these four; there will be great reward. Should there be trouble, I alone will bear it. Should any deliberately let them go, they shall share their guilt.” The men roused themselves and gave chase. In a moment they were upon them. Hu Qian sounded a whistle; all brandished weapons and shouted at them to return at once, threatening death if they resisted. Lan Xiu cursed the villains as heartless thieves and wished them struck by lightning. The boy saw no path and urged his uncle to flee quickly.

Lan Xiu still shouted abuse. Hu Qian took out ropes and ordered the men to bind the shameless ones. Caihe and Yueying were unarmed. Caihe, though master of the house, thought Hu Qian would not dare harm him, and sneered, “We go back to our own home; why must you force us? Sister, let us return and see what means they have to deal with us.” Saying so, he turned and strode towards his home. Yueying followed. Though Lan Xiu and the boy continued to curse, they had to follow behind. Yet Hu Qian was minded to humiliate Caihe and Yueying further. He harboured a wicked thought: if he could kill them both and leave the Hu family to bear the blame, he might seize the opportunity to profit and escape afar. Therefore he would not let them go so freely, but would forcefully bind them and send them to county for trial.

At his command, the men rushed forward, seizing Caihe and Yueying to bind them. Suddenly Yueying cried aloud, “Immortal Master above! I, your disciple Yueying, from childhood until now have never forgotten your instructions, nor ceased my devotion to the Way. Because I could not bear to see my husband fall to evil, I delayed leaving the world for years. But today I suffer such disgrace. Though my fate be hard, I am a lady of good birth, enduring hardship without complaint. But this insult I will not bear. I now care not for my husband’s future, and will risk my remaining life to meet my Master on high.” Saying this, she suddenly broke free and fled toward the riverbank.

All knew her intent was to drown herself, and this was exactly what Hu Qian desired. He called out to his men not to save her. The others were indifferent; only Caihe wept and called out, striving to follow. But one hand was held fast, and in desperation Caihe bit the hand hard, causing pain and release. Caihe rushed after Yueying. Hu Qian said, “Let her go, let her go; see how they die.” Lan Xiu and the boy were held fast and could not follow. All stood in daze, watching the young couple run to the riverbank, clasping heads and weeping, and leap into the water.

The river was a bend of the lower Yangtze, where the water was deep and swift, and to enter meant certain death. Caihe and Yueying were both frail children, and their plunge surely ended their lives. Yet the affairs of the world have not no law but the law of Heaven. Should children so rooted in goodness die at Hu Qian’s hand, would not Heaven’s justice and the law of the land have vanished completely? Be assured, the world is not so unjust.

Now all the villains stared intently as the young masters leapt in, listening for the splash of their fall, to mark their task done and prepare to return for reward. Even Hu Qian watched carefully, awaiting their sinking, ready to proceed with his next plan. But although he saw them enter the water, he heard no splash. This puzzled the crowd, who moved in unison to the river’s edge, peering down. Ah! A wondrous and inexplicable scene appeared before all. Lan Xiu and the boy shouted joyfully, “Heaven is just! Heaven is just!” Hu Qian was dumbfounded, unable for some time to speak.

What this remarkable spectacle was, and how it ended, is a matter for another chapter to unfold.
