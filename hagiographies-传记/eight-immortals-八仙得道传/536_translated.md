# Chapter 68: The Official Appointment to Settle the Case of the Peach Theft; The Refining of the Impure Mirror to Shatter the Eye-Covering Orb

Now it happened that Zhen Zhuzi, on meeting Dongfang Shuo, paid him due respect and sought his favour; and hastily he consented, saying, "Both of us are men who remove harm from the people; there is no need for words of thanks." As he spoke, he took out a small mirror-box, opened it and looked inside, beholding two mirrors, one above and one below. Between the mirrors were reflected two pairs of naked men and women, there performing the rites of the Duke of Zhou. Dongfang Shuo could not help but laugh heartily, and asked, "What is the meaning of this?" Xuan Zhuzi also laughed and said, "The Eye-Covering Orb of Lord Li Shaojun is most potent because of the impure yin vapour it contains, which is refined into a heavy mist. Thus, whether immortal or mortal, none can open their eyes. The bottle formerly used by Tonghui was good, indeed, but it could only break his magic, and could not destroy the orb itself. Now I have refined this mirror, taking its utmost impurity and filth, which can counteract that foul vapour. The light of the mirror is taken from the fiercest sunshine, able to dispel his mist and burn his orb. Without this, it cannot be broken."

Dongfang Shuo rejoiced greatly, and then spoke out the doubts he had harboured. The two immortals said, "This thing has offended Heaven. Heaven has sent down punishment, and it should be done with open and just execution, so as to strike terror into the hearts of the demon folk. What you have seen is truly upright and straightforward. It is well that there is a means to control him; there is no fear of his resistance." Dongfang Shuo agreed gladly, and asked, "When may we begin?" Xuan Zhuzi said, "I, the poor Daoist, cannot stay long. It is best to seize him at once, to interrogate and make the offender die without complaint, so that the bystanders may see and be fearful. Then, proclaim the Jade Decree, and proceed at once to execution. What say you?" Dongfang Shuo heard this, and together with Xuan Zhuzi and Tieguai, went to the west end of the palace, to the mansion of Lord Li Shaojun. They entered and plainly requested that Li Shaojun come forth to receive the decree. Shaojun was then in his rear garden, drinking and making merry with a band of concubines; when a servant reported, "Lord Dongfang has brought two Daoist gentlemen to deliver an imperial decree." Shaojun was at first confused, thinking it was the Emperor's edict, and hastily dressed and came out to meet the three.

Dongfang Shuo stood in the foremost place, and said, "The Emperor on high has commanded: Li Shaojun, kneel to receive." With these words he suddenly roused Li Shaojun. But Shaojun neither knelt nor showed anger; on the contrary, he smiled and said, "Lord Dongfang, we are both ministers of the same court, colleagues, and fellow disciples of the Dao; our situation is closer than with others. Just now you said you came to deliver a decree; I mistook it for an edict from the present Emperor, and so came out with reverence to receive it. But to my surprise, what you proclaimed is the Jade Decree of the Emperor above. If I may speak plainly, men and Heaven are far apart, and it is uncertain how true or false such things are. Since you and I are so friendly, you should first inform me of its contents; in matters of good or ill fortune, I might prepare myself accordingly. What do you think?"

Seeing his crafty evasion, and plainly his contempt for the law and disrespect to Heaven, Dongfang Shuo was greatly angered, and shouted, "How dare you, Li Shaojun, be so rude! You say we cultivate the Dao and should be governed by the higher realm; but even the emperors of men have authority over ordinary people; can Heaven not also control you? You, who act unlawfully and defy both Heaven and sovereign, show plainly your disobedience to the Jade Emperor and your rebellious heart. Your words are arrogant, scorning the Jade Decree; this is a crime beyond pardon." Shaojun, hearing this, was furious; relying on his strong defenses and knowing that Dongfang Shuo's Daoist arts were not very profound, he felt no fear. He wiped his face, sneered coldly, and said, "If so, you must be the imperial officer sent by the Jade Emperor, bent on making trouble for me. Never mind that we belong to different sects; even if we were of the same school, I am now a minister of men, trusted by the Emperor, and need not obey the commands of the higher realm."

Seeing him grow more boastful, Dongfang Shuo quickly said to the two immortals, "This fellow is so bold; I beg you two to seize him for me." Hearing the word "seize," Shaojun drew his sword and charged at Dongfang Shuo. Xuan Zhu stepped forward with his sword to block him. Shaojun shouted, "This is no place for fighting; those with courage, come with me to the rear square." The three immortals shouted, "Even if we reach the demon lord's own den, who would fear you?" So the pursuit pressed on. Unexpectedly, Shaojun ran through a courtyard and came to an open hall, where he stopped.

The three immortals entered the hall, and immediately felt as if a black curtain blocked their sight, so that they could not see one another. They knew this was where he hung the Eye-Covering Orb, and thankfully they had prepared beforehand. Xuan Zhu took out the mirror-box, and held the upper mirror outward; strange to say, the small mirror cast a blue flame of light throughout the hall and outside, instantly dispelling the black mist. Then he held up the lower mirror; there was a clattering sound, and black flakes flew down from the ceiling. It was that Shaojun's Eye-Covering Orb was shattered. Seeing the loss of this wondrous treasure and knowing resistance was futile, Shaojun hastily transformed into black clouds and fled upward into the sky. The three immortals mounted clouds and gave chase. But Shaojun, often entering the palace, for convenience had built a chamber just behind the palace, but a short distance away. In the twinkling of an eye, a beam of blue light shot into the palace, and he immediately vanished from sight.

Seeing that he had entered the palace, the three immortals deemed it unwise to continue the pursuit, and so returned to attend to the matter of Wang Yizhi. Yizhi was naturally unlike Shaojun, having already confessed his guilt. When the Jade Decree arrived, he prostrated himself and begged for death. Dongfang Shuo ordered that he see his master before the law was carried out. Yizhi thanked him and rose to pay respects to Tieguai Xiansheng, bowing with audible knocks and not daring to look up. Tieguai Xiansheng, seeing his pitiable state, sighed and said, "Fate is preordained; why speak further? Since you know your guilt, go quickly to your punishment. As for matters after death, I will bear them on your behalf, so you need not worry. Your disciple Fei Changfang is a man of backbone and uprightness, understanding rites and righteousness; you may call him to see me." Yizhi arose and summoned Changfang, who came to pay respects to the three immortals.

Tieguai Xiansheng commanded, "Your master has offended Heaven and brought punishment upon himself. After his death, I shall guide his soul in further cultivation. If he be diligent, in five hundred years there will be benefit. His office should be continued by you; be careful and attentive, and do it well. If well done, it is a great merit; if not, your master’s fate serves as an example." Changfang wept and bowed, saying, "I do not wish to take on my master's post. But I hope the Forebearer, who opened Heaven and Earth, will remember my master's sincerity and diligence, and acknowledge some merit. I pray that this may be reported to the Jade Emperor, that his death may be spared. As disciples and masters, we shall redouble our efforts to do good deeds and make amends, humbly imploring the Forebearer’s approval."

Tieguai shook his head, saying, "This is fixed; there is no turning back. If you doubt, ask your master. When first appointed to this office, how did I instruct him? As for your succeeding your master, this is not for me to decide; it is by command of the Daoist Ancestor. You must always remember your master’s crime today, never forget it, and strive to be a good man; thus you will be worthy of your master. You yourself will also benefit. But... ah... this need not be said. Affairs of the world cannot escape fate. Who but a man of great wisdom and great fortune can overturn it? Since it is of no avail, there is no need for more words. I have said enough. Brother Dongfang, proceed with the punishment at once."

At that moment, Wang Yizhi was already kneeling before the hall. Dongfang Shuo sighed and said to Tieguai, "Let me take some charge, and give him a complete corpse." At these words, he stretched out two fingers, and a white light suddenly flew forth, attaching itself to Yizhi’s body and becoming a white silk ribbon, binding tightly about his neck. The immortal power is unlike common nooses. In an instant, Yizhi’s soul left his body, and his corpse fell to the ground. Changfang and other disciples wept loudly.

Tieguai had already seized Yizhi’s soul and enclosed it in a gourd. He clasped his hands and said to Xuan Zhu, "Soon Brother Dongfang will have a great calamity, which is also predestined and unavoidable. There is a Ninefold Resurrection Talisman and a Soul-Calling Banner; Brother, keep these with you. When he meets misfortune, place the talisman on his neck. Thus the demon may be cut off. Then use the banner to bring Brother Dongfang away, and daily give him one of the Qianyuan Life-Quenching Pills which he himself has prepared. After three days, he will recover his vitality. Afterwards, when Brother Dongfang’s earthly task is complete, he may return to the Heavenly Court and need no longer remain among mortals. Even the Han Emperor, when his time comes, will no longer require Brother Dongfang’s attendance here."

Xuan Zhu heard this and agreed in all things; then asked Tieguai if any unexpected events might befall him on returning. Tieguai was greatly surprised, and after gazing at him with his spiritual eye, sighed and said, "Words are the voice of the heart, and the heart is the master of events. Brother, be upright and impartial; why harbor such doubts? The Book of Changes says, ‘Good or ill, repentance or remorse, arise from movement.’ Your words are also a movement. For one who cultivates the Dao, the greatest danger is to have a troubled heart. Your future path is indeed not very peaceful. But among my juniors there are kindred spirits who will come to your aid. Have no fear and proceed with your conscience clear. As to bodily punishments, we do not fear them. Heaven’s secrets are hard to reveal. What I know is more than this, but what can be spoken is only this. Farewell!" Having spoken, he raised his hand to his forehead in farewell, and in a moment his figure vanished; he had in truth departed by earth concealment.

Dongfang Shuo and Xuan Zhuzi, hearing Tieguai’s words, felt somewhat uneasy. They gave Changfang several instructions, then returned to Dongfang’s home to confer on further methods to destroy Li Shaojun.

Meanwhile, when Shaojun met the Martial Emperor, he immediately wept and prostrated himself, saying, "Dongfang Shuo envies me my daily service to Your Majesty; fearing I should expose his many great crimes against the sovereign, he specially invited a distant demon to make trouble for me, shattering the magic treasure I have cultivated for a thousand years, and daring to counterfeit the Jade Decree to take my life. I beg Your Majesty to intercede for me."

The Martial Emperor, angered, said, "Dongfang Manqian has deceived me again and again. Now he makes trouble for the gentleman; he is truly a wretch worthy of death. Fear not, I will dispatch the imperial guards to expel him from the realm, forbidding him to remain in the central plains. Is that well?" Shaojun quickly reported, "This man’s Dao is deep, and he has demons to assist him. If Your Majesty will not use him, then he should be swiftly slain. If only expelled, he will bear grudges and seek revenge; not only I myself shall be helpless in defense, but Your Majesty will also be in danger. It is better to execute him at once."

The Martial Emperor, then harbouring resentment against Dongfang Shuo and trusting Shaojun, upon hearing this edict, immediately issued the order to behead Dongfang Shuo, and commanded Shaojun to oversee the execution. Shaojun, delighted, led several hundred imperial guards to surround Dongfang Shuo’s residence. Dongfang Shuo, bewildered, was about to come out and inquire, when Shaojun, with four stout generals, strode in and met Dongfang Shuo, ordering him seized. Dongfang Shuo stepped back a few paces and asked, "What does this mean?" Shaojun, like Dongfang Shuo’s own manner, commanded him to kneel to receive the edict, and drew forth the imperial decree. Dongfang Shuo was a true immortal and naturally observed his ministerial duty; having the decree, he knelt to receive it. Shaojun stood in the middle, opened and read the decree, and without awaiting thanks, swiftly drew a flying sword and cut off Dongfang Shuo’s head.

Reader, take note: this was the retribution for Dongfang Shuo’s theft of the peach, given by the Queen Mother of the West. Yet this matter was carried out too unjustly. Dongfang Shuo was a man of Dao and magic; was he to fear the punishment of one sword? Behold, when his head was cut off, in an instant a new head grew again. Shaojun then used the flying sword to strike again; the head fell, but from the neck there sprang another head; and so it went several times. Shaojun pondered, then thought of a plan. He immediately sent messengers and swift riders to report to the Martial Emperor, bringing the imperial seal, and the Emperor came in person. The Emperor, ignorant of the details, was curious and also unwilling to oppose Shaojun’s wishes; indeed, he arranged his escort and came to Dongfang’s home. Shaojun knelt to welcome him in, and reported Dongfang Shuo’s sorcery, his defiance of the sovereign, his contempt for the law and Heaven. The Emperor was persuaded and angered, yet feared Dongfang Shuo’s strong magic and possible revenge. Since the punishment had been administered, he must be put to death. He quickly asked Shaojun what further measures should be taken. Shaojun answered, "May Your Majesty impress the imperial seal on paper, and when his head falls, place it upon his neck to seal the wound, so that no more heads may grow." The Emperor obeyed, took out the imperial treasure, and stamped a sheet of paper.

Shaojun again cut off Dongfang Shuo’s head with the flying sword, and placed the paper bearing the imperial seal on his neck. Truly, the law is revered and imperial power great; with this paper, even Dongfang Shuo’s great magic was powerless. His head was cut off in vain, and no new head could grow. Meanwhile, Xuan Zhuzi had already emerged, using invisibility to hide at the side. Seeing the head severed and Shaojun speaking with the Emperor, all were careless of the corpse. Taking advantage, Xuan Zhu appeared, pretending to examine the dead, approached Dongfang Shuo’s body, removed the paper, replaced it with Tieguai’s talisman, and placed a small sword about an inch long in his hand, speaking, "Dongfang Shuo, hear this: the law is confessed and retribution clear. Heaven’s law cannot be escaped. Your crimes are here; will you not act?"

Before the words were finished, Dongfang Shuo’s headless corpse suddenly grasped the sword, following Xuan Zhu to fly upward. Instantly, the Emperor and his attendants and eunuchs all cried out, "Alas! The dead ghost escapes!" Though a wise ruler, the Emperor was old and addicted to wine and women, with failing energy. Moreover, as the Son of Heaven, he had never been to the execution ground, nor in battle. Seeing this dreadful sight, how could he hold up? He fell backward fainting. Shaojun, bold though he was, had blinded eyes and suddenly lost his wits. Unable to resist with magic, he was seized by Xuan Zhu’s hands at the throat, who read the Jade Decree aloud, enumerating his crimes. The crowd, ignorant of the truth, dared not approach nor question. When Xuan Zhu finished reading, Dongfang Shuo’s sword flashed in the wind, three feet long, and stabbed Shaojun deeply in the abdomen. Shaojun cried aloud, rolled on the ground, revealing his true form—a huge turtle. He looked about, seeking escape, but Xuan Zhu used magic to restrain him; he crawled about the hall, turning and twisting. The Emperor soon revived, but on seeing Shaojun transformed into a great turtle, was greatly alarmed and frightened; his spirit fled, and he was restless and uneasy, hastily ordering a return to the palace.

Here Xuan Zhu struck the turtle’s shell thrice with the celestial sword; a great crash shook the roof and tiles, but the shell did not move, and Xuan Zhu’s sword fell to the ground. Enraged, Xuan Zhu let his hair loose, took up his sword and strode forth, chanting spells and drawing talismans to summon Lei Gong and Dian Mu. Under the bright sky, suddenly the heavens darkened, the daylight waned. The thunder and lightning deities stood in the air and bowed, asking, "What business calls the Master of the Law?" Xuan Zhu raised his hand in salute and said loudly, "The turtle demon Li Shaojun has repeatedly harmed living beings, a great sinner. Recently he transformed into a man and took a place at court, insulting the pure souls, deceiving the Emperor, and committing many unlawful acts. I, the Star of the Years, have been commissioned by the Emperor above to investigate this case. But the Star himself has a lingering debt unfulfilled, and was deceived by the turtle demon to be beheaded first. Now the Star’s grievance is ended, and soon he may be reborn. But the turtle demon’s sins are heavy; he cannot be allowed to prolong his days. The Star has entrusted me to assist in exterminating the demon. The demon’s true form is now revealed, but his shell is very hard. I am ashamed of my meagre skill, and cannot shatter it. I beg the honoured gods to graciously lend their power to strike with thunder and lightning, that the shell may be broken. Your aid is most welcome." Lei Gong, after consulting Dian Mu, said, "The turtle demon’s mischief long deserved punishment. Fortuitously, it is summer, the season for thunder and lightning to manifest their might. Master of the Law, please step aside and let us begin the ritual."

Xuan Zhuzi thanked them and summoned Dongfang Shuo’s body; they entered together. Xuan Zhu ordered the head brought forward. Holding it in his hands, he aligned it with the neck and restored it to its original place. Then he took out Tieguai’s talisman and placed it at the hairline. Chanting spells, he cried out and joined head and body seamlessly, with no trace remaining. Yet Dongfang Shuo could neither move nor speak. Xuan Zhu laid him aside, then raised his head to the window, hearing Lei Gong and Dian Mu dispatching troops and striking their drums, making a strange clatter. From the ground came a sound like thunder. Where the thunder rose, a golden light shot up from the earth, striking the great turtle in Dongfang’s courtyard. Cracking and crashing, the turtle’s shell shattered into dozens of pieces, blood and flesh spilling, the stench foul beyond words. Thus ended the turtle life of Li Shaojun. Yet the method of the Eye-Covering Orb, invented by him and handed down to this day, is no longer understood, but worshipped as sacred. Hence all call it the Eye-Covering Spirit.

Such magic, if used to catch thieves, investigate cases, or assist all police matters, is very effective. But alas, those possessing such methods are often charlatans, using them to gather money. For example, when a man is publicly killed and dismembered, he can immediately be reassembled; or counterfeit money exchanged for real currency, though kept in the most secure and secret places, can still be altered by magic. These are all effects of the Eye-Covering. Formerly, seasoned travellers often placed most impure things, such as erotic moon-cloth, among their silver dollars, reputed to prevent sorcerers’ secret plots; this is the meaning of Xuan Zhu’s impure mirror breaking the Eye-Covering Orb. This is idle talk, which may be passed over.

Returning to Lei Gong and Dian Mu’s aid in destroying Shaojun’s true form, Xuan Zhuzi mounted the clouds and thanked the two gods repeatedly. They laughed, "We are but servants of Heaven and Earth, performing our appointed tasks; what need for thanks?" Xuan Zhuzi praised their power; they laughed, "We are merely conduits of Heaven’s energy, fitting masters of the moment. What power have we? Moreover, the world is full of evildoers, and thunder and lightning do not come at all times. To raise thunder for one or two villains, bringing trouble upon the people, is not convenient. We have petitioned the Jade Emperor, proposing to make electricity public, so that those with authority to enforce the law might use our power to punish evil-doers. Thus petty men may learn fear, and crimes might lessen somewhat, though this is uncertain." Xuan Zhuzi said eagerly, "This method is excellent. May it be adopted?"

Dian Mu replied, "The Jade Emperor has indeed given this attention, convening all the immortals and Western Buddha in a grand council. The result was that most said, ‘In the world today, evildoers are far fewer than good men; thunder and lightning as a terror suffice to warn the wicked. If the power of electricity be handed to men, and used commonly, familiarity breeds contempt, and the effect of warning will be lost. It is better to leave things as they are.’ Only the Western Buddha sighed, ‘The world grows ever more corrupt, human hearts more depraved. If this continues, within a thousand or two thousand years, one in a hundred may be a righteous man. Then weapons shall lose their effect, and the world will no longer be warned. The method proposed by the thunder and lightning spirits may yet be implemented, but after long time misuses will arise, and petty men will use electricity to oppress the virtuous. Those who may truly administer justice will still have to rely on the thunder and lightning spirits.’ When the Buddha spoke thus, all sighed deeply. This matter remains undecided; who knows what the future holds?" Xuan Zhuzi sighed, "Then we can only wait until that time to deal with it." The two gods nodded, took up their powers, and departed.

Xuan Zhu descended from the cloud to Dongfang’s home. Dongfang Shuo stood dazed to one side. Xuan Zhuzi took out the Soul-Calling Banner and waved it before Dongfang Shuo, who shuddered. Xuan Zhuzi tied the banner to himself and went forward, and Dongfang Shuo followed close behind. They left the house; using earth-shrinking art, they returned to Haining. At an inn, Xuan Zhuzi entered to lodge, leaving Dongfang Shuo outside standing facing the wall. Everywhere they went, people marvelled at the living corpse that fled with them. Xuan Zhu, following Tieguai’s instructions, when the corpse fell, it turned into thick blood. To prevent bystanders from toppling it, he cast a magical circle; none could cross its boundary as if blocked by a wall. Sometimes crossing a river by boat, he placed the corpse at the prow and used the same method to keep the crowd at bay. Along the way, no troubles occurred. But upon reaching Haining, a great matter arose.

What great matter this was, we shall see in the next chapter.
