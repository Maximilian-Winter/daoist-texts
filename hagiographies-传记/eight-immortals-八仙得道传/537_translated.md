# Chapter 69: The Crippled Immortal First Invents the Returning Corpse; The Virtuous Maiden Mistakenly Weds a Flood Dragon Spirit

It is said that in the present time, within the province of Hunan, in the regions about Baoqing and Changde, the customs handed down include a certain method called the Returning Corpse. Whenever a person of place A dies in place B, not only is the removal of the coffin difficult, but the expenses are also exceedingly great. There arose therefore a class of men whose business it was to escort the dead back to their native homes. They possessed a secret incantation, and bore upon themselves a soul-summoning banner; chanting spells over the corpse, the dead would of themselves follow on the journey. When they came upon a place for rest and refreshment, they laid the corpse beneath the eaves outside, with its face turned to the wall. If they encountered a river crossing where boats were taken, they carried the corpse off the vessel, standing it upright at the rear or prow of the boat; in this way the corpse safely arrived at home. Though the journey might last a whole month, in the height of summer heat, the corpse would not change shape nor emit foul odour; yet it must not be allowed to stumble, for once it fell, it would immediately putrefy and swarm with worms, and could not rise again. More strangely still, when the corpse reached the very door of the family, that family ought to have long before prepared the coffin and burial arrangements in readiness. Upon its arrival, the coffin must at once be set in place without delay; if postponed even one or two hours, the corpse would rot and become beyond repair. In general, the method of transporting corpses is counted the most convenient and economical of all. For thousands of years it has been handed down, flourishing without cessation, yet none know when it was first created, or by whom it was invented. According to the investigations of the author of this volume, it is none other than the symbol and incantation whereby the Crippled Immortal taught the spirit Xuan Zhu to carry the corpse of Dongfang Shuo to Haining. For after Xuan Zhu had incurred offence, and was banished to the Xiang River as a crane, he also once changed himself into a commoner and did such deeds; thus this method spread within Hunan province. But only within Hunan does such a method of Returning Corpse exist; nowhere else has it been heard of. The reason is the nature of the Chinese people; when there is some special invention, it is always handed down from grandfather to grandson, not only withheld from outsiders, but even the girls of the household are not permitted to hear of it. For when the girls grow up, they are bound to be married; and once in love with their husbands, they reveal all secrets, and over time the secret spreads far and wide. Would not this secret method thereby become a public means? Hence in Chinese custom there are many secrets and prescriptions that might benefit society and relieve the poor and sick, yet these secrets never spread widely; such is the reason.

Again, things like the Returning Corpse may seem close to superstition; yet whether superstition or not, if indeed it can be done, and can be tested by the people, and is truly convenient for them, who can but believe? To believe to the utmost degree is but right; how then can one call it superstitious? Even if it were truly superstition, so long as it has value in causing belief, even if the belief be extreme, what harm is there? Moreover, all beginnings have some reason within them, though they are commonly regarded as mysterious. The originator speaks only of the method; the receiver cannot fathom the principle, thus forming a condition where it may be used but not known. Such matters most hinder the progress of culture and science. For example, the Returning Corpse is said to be a form of immortal art; this is indeed true. But the affairs of the world have reason, even if the method is not thought out. It cannot be that the method exists without reason. Besides, the immortals are the chosen essence of millions, those who have succeeded in cultivation. If they can invent methods convenient to the people, would they fail to discover the reason for such methods? If there be no reason, whence then the invention? The tales in novels are mostly vague, uncertain, and unprovable ghost stories and wonders, provided only for readers’ amusement after wine and tea, to dispel sorrow and boredom.

Where no evidence exists, there naturally is no reason. But in this book, the various true deeds of immortals and extraordinary persons mostly have evidence, eight or nine out of ten can be sought after. Especially as above recorded concerning the Returning Corpse, to this day it truly exists within Hunan province. Moreover, not only the Returning Corpse, but also the technique of covering the eyeballs of Li Shaojun—though he is dead—the art of covering eyeballs has spread throughout the realm; all manner of wandering men of the rivers and lakes use it as a magic trick, and it is known to all. This Returning Corpse method, likewise, possesses method but not reason. Thus these excellent immortal arts serve only a few poor people as means to earn food and clothing; beyond that they are of no use, nor can they be improved upon. Magic and transformation give rise to many methods convenient to the people; the legislators have no responsibility in this matter. The fault lies with those first possessed of these methods, who either withheld the reason from the legislators or refused to declare the principles, so that over time the practitioners know only the fact but not the cause. How laughable, how lamentable, how regrettable, how hateful! Therefore I have thought that such methods, if invented by present-day scientists and philosophers, would not be lightly let go, but thoroughly studied, even compiled into books and made public to the world. Readers, having read their books and followed their established methods, might further discover other reasons, develop other enterprises, and perhaps improve upon the predecessors’ methods, making them ever more perfect and complete, admirable and consummate—these are plain matters to the ear and eye. The author does not seek to belittle others’ aspirations or disgrace his own.

Enough of empty words; lest the reader grow weary, I hasten to the main text. The last chapter told how Xuan Zhu invented the Returning Corpse method and bore Dongfang Shuo to Haining, whereupon a great disturbance arose. But the author must first declare that Dongfang Shuo, arriving at Haining, was tended to by Xuan Zhu in accordance with the Crippled Immortal’s instructions; before long his spirit and body were restored as before. His banishment was at an end; summoned by the Emperor, he returned to Heaven to serve. His affairs can be brought to a close. The so-called great disturbance refers specifically to Xuan Zhu himself.

Since assisting Dongfang Shuo and executing Li Shaojun, Xuan Zhu believed the old flood dragon had lost his arm of assistance and thus failed to satisfy his desires; he gradually grew lax in guarding against higher powers. Matters in the world are mostly changeful and hard to anticipate; yet if one is cautious and prepares beforehand, one’s affairs will naturally be more secure, especially those concerning the state’s livelihood and security, which are of utmost importance. Those entrusted with such must be especially careful, to avert troubles before they arise.

Yet, to this must be added further reflection. The human mind, often in times of distress, acts with caution; yet when the storm passes and waters calm, it becomes unconsciously careless. Hence the ancients said, “Life is born of anxiety, death of ease.” Such is the principle. The present case of Xuan Zhu is much the same. But the disaster he brought was beyond expectation; as the saying goes, a great wind arises from the least of reeds. Though strong the wind, its source is very slight.

At that time, within the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, there dwelt a government family surnamed He, with no men remaining, only a mother and daughter relying on each other. The mother, called Madam Hu, was advanced in years. Her daughter, Chunying by name, was graceful and lovely, neat and handsome; she was then twenty-five years old. Madam Hu, knowing her own age, and that this was her only daughter, wished to find a suitable man to take into her house, to have a son-in-law to depend upon. But high families spurned them, considering their condition unlucky and an ill-omened lineage, and moreover, the custom deemed taking a husband into the wife’s house a shame, so no one desired to try. As for low families, they were not the mother and daughter’s wish. Thus the years passed, and the fine maiden had reached twenty-five without a match.

Madam Hu was often melancholy, but Chunying found joy in attending her aged mother. She said, “Whether I marry or not is not of concern; only that mother might live a hundred years or more, so that when daughter grows old we might enter the earth and return to Heaven together - that will suffice for my heart’s desire.” Madam Hu laughed and scolded, “Foolish girl! At such an age, you speak madness. Your mother has done no great meritorious work, nor accumulated virtue; how could she live so long? Moreover, if your wish were fulfilled, two old women would live alone, with no one to care for them in life or mourn them in death, and thus the ancestral incense would cease - not a good thing at all. I think it better, when a suitable young man appears, to care little for his family background but to marry him off without delay. If you are truly filial, do not be so stubborn; that is far better than dying together.” Chunying, hearing this, could only nod and consent, saying, “I will obey Mother’s will and speak no more.” Madam Hu thus was comforted.

Not long after, their home was suddenly robbed, Madam Hu’s belongings stolen clean; the matter was reported to the authorities but no trace was found. Madam Hu wept, saying, “My child, this is because we have no man in the house; it invites insult. If that day it were not only thieves, but open robbery, what could two women do but yield? To steal some things is not so bad, but if there were violations, how could my daughter bear it?” She broke into tears at this thought.

After some persuasion, Chunying devised a plan. She said, “Mother, do not worry. I have thought of a measure. The thieves are bold because there are too many rooms and too few people. Why not rent out the many unoccupied rooms? We need not seek high rent, only decent and orderly tenants who can be good neighbours and watch over each other; even if no rent is taken, it is better than leaving the rooms empty, which would soon fall into ruin. Having honest people living there to tend the house would be good. Mother, what say you to this?” Madam Hu agreed, and Chunying herself wrote a rental notice, which was posted at the city office. Within three days many came to view the rooms, but none were suitable; either they were of questionable profession or had too many people. Madam Hu was displeased. On the fourth morning, a gentleman in white came—a scholar of fair countenance, lips like vermilion, demeanor gentle, speech clear. He claimed to be the son of an official family, who, drawn by Hangzhou’s clear and serene scenery, wished to settle here. He said his father had been a high official but was deceased; his mother and younger siblings remained in his home city, and once the house was rented he would bring them here. The mother and daughter were pleased at sight of such a gentleman; believing his words and his many family members, they agreed at once. When asked about rent, Madam Hu said she valued good neighbours more than rent, and would leave the price to his direction. The man paid a hundred taels of silver as a deposit, saying the rent would be arranged when family arrived. Seeing his generosity, Madam Hu trusted that he was a true gentleman and accepted him with courtesy. When asked his name, he said Wang Chengfu, then took his leave.

More than half a month passed when Wang Chengfu returned, saying that owing to unfinished affairs at his home city, he could not yet bring his family, but wished to come to Hangzhou to study, bringing a few servants with him. Madam Hu and Chunying trusted him as a man of good character; what reason was there to refuse? Wang was pleased and immediately brought his luggage and fine furnishings—very exquisite and elegant. Though the He household was wealthy with many treasures, Wang’s furnishings were incomparable. He brought over ten male and female servants. His manner was honest and attentive. Besides studying, he spoke often with Madam Hu, saying that her appearance and disposition resembled his mother’s, and so he took her as a foster mother, and made Chunying his sister; thus there was no occasion for suspicion, and they could meet often. The brother and sister served Madam Hu day and night, delighting her beyond measure. Madam Hu formed the design to take Wang as a son-in-law. She inquired of his servants and learned he was ambitious and wished to marry a talented and beautiful woman; being the same age as Chunying, both twenty-five, she was glad indeed. She told this to Chunying.

Little did they know that Wang Chengfu and Chunying were a true pair of worthy man and beautiful woman; though their acquaintance was new, their feelings deep. Hearing her mother’s words, Chunying blushed and shyly said, “Brother Wang is indeed of good character. Mother, do as you think best.” Madam Hu knew her daughter’s heart was fully set, but knew not Wang’s own thoughts. There was no matchmaker, only her own brother, He Deshan, who often came here and had met Wang several times. Wang called him uncle, and the two seemed on close terms. No one else was available, so they sent for He Deshan and told him of the matter.

He Deshan agreed and at once went to Wang’s house. Wang was engaged in some task when Deshan coughed outside the window; Wang heard and came out, saying, “Uncle, whence come you?” Deshan took his hand and they entered, jokingly saying, “I come to congratulate you.” Wang smiled and asked, “Uncle, you are a senior; no joking. What joy is there to congratulate? Pray tell.” Deshan laughed and explained. Wang was greatly pleased, saying, “Sister Ying’s consent to wed me is not to be opposed. But as I am a stranger here, matters must be simple. I ask foster mother, uncle, and sister to forgive me.” Deshan laughed, “We are all relatives by choice; why quibble over petty forms? So long as you are willing to take her into your house, all may be arranged.” Wang laughed, “Now that we live under one roof, it is as if I have already married in. When we wed, my mother and brothers will come to live with us; with the two families together and close relatives, what division remains?” Deshan agreed and went back to report to his sister. Madam Hu and Chunying approved, but as both families were grown, the marriage should be completed soon. Deshan explained this to Wang, who readily consented.

As the two households dwelt together, all affairs were very convenient. A date was chosen, and some new furnishings acquired; the rest of the household goods were ready, both families being wealthy, so no urgent preparations were needed. All was in order, and when the joyful day came, many relatives and friends came to celebrate. Even Wang, though a stranger, had many friends who came to help and congratulate. The two families held the wedding together, which made it all the more lively.

Three days after, the new couple first worshipped the mother-in-law, then returned together to their home. Madam Hu looked at her daughter and son-in-law, noting their talents, appearance, and bearing, and saw they were well matched, a proper pair; her heart was filled with joy. As the two families were united, Madam Hu worried for her son-in-law; living outside, the servants might not care for him; her daughter, cherished and pampered, would not serve him. So she took the decision to have them move in together, sharing the inner room. The many outer rooms were given to the servants. At this time Madam Hu feared that when Wang’s family arrived, they would take her beloved son-in-law away, like recalling a borrowed object to its owner. She often spoke to her daughter of this, but Chunying, understanding propriety, thought that kin should be reunited under one roof; living in one house but separated by inner and outer quarters, what difference was there? So she never mentioned this to Wang.

Yet strange matters arose. Wang always said his family was in Jianye city, but none had come. He often spoke of his mother and others soon coming to Hangzhou, yet after three years no one arrived. Chunying surmised he was altogether indifferent to his family. Madam Hu, old and dim of wit, only wished her son-in-law and daughter to remain close to her; if no one took her son-in-law away, that was enough. As to his family affairs, she cared not. Chunying, a woman of utmost intelligence, perceived this peculiarity, and could not help but be suspicious. Often she hinted at her doubts and watched Wang closely. Yet Wang seemed troubled; fearful she would question his family matters, he was evasive and uneasy even in answers, thus increasing her suspicion.

By this time Chunying had borne twins twice; strangely, both births were accompanied by dreams of golden dragons entering her. Upon waking, she told Wang. He said, “This is a sign of imperial destiny. Might the children have the fortune of the Nine Five?” Fearing the news would bring trouble, he forbade her to tell others. Chunying was half convinced. Three years later, after the second birth, again twins were born, and again the strange dream occurred—this time clearer. She recognized the dragon’s shape as somewhat different from ordinary dragons, and it bore a fierce spirit that inspired awe. Upon waking, she told Wang of this. Wang’s face changed at the mention of the dragon’s shape; though he smiled and reasoned with her, the smile showed hints of menace and secrecy. Chunying’s thoughts turned sharply; though years of marriage and deep affection bound them, he seemed not wholly sincere with his wife’s earnestness. She felt that though they shared pillow and bed, each had words unspoken. Might her husband’s origin be uncertain? She piled these thoughts in her heart, and resolved to uncover his hidden secret, telling no other.

Yet Wang was a most cautious man. After the birth of the second twins, Chunying sought to probe and examine his conduct and speech. He gave no fault; only concerning his family in Jianye was he at a loss for words. Whenever the mother and daughter pressed the matter, he excused himself or changed the subject. At last he gave a perfect reason: his birth mother was dead; his stepmother in Jianye was cruel and lewd, utterly unfit to live with. His brothers were hers, and naturally sided with her. Frankly, he came to Hangzhou driven away. He had not spoken openly before for the sake of propriety, fearing to speak ill of his mother; now, seeing his wife’s doubts, he must speak frankly, lest she think him of unknown origin. He spoke with tears and seeming deep grief. The mother and daughter believed his words; fearing the arrival of stepmother and brothers, they hoped never to see that woman. After this, Chunying’s doubts were dispelled and her love deepened.

Yet troubles brought by awkward men can never be wholly settled. One hot and oppressive night, from Madam Hu down to her four children, all sat in the back garden to enjoy the cool. Wang, weary of the children’s restlessness, lay alone on a short couch beneath the bean trellis, about a hundred steps from the others. Resting awhile, a clear breeze arose and refreshed his spirit; he soon fell into sweet sleep. Madam Hu, playing with a little girl, paid him no mind. Unbeknownst to her, a great serpent dwelt upon the bean trellis; near the trellis grew many fruit trees with bird’s nests. Madam Hu, kind by nature, forbade servants to destroy nests, so they multiplied until almost every tree bore one or two. Suddenly she thought of her son-in-law sleeping under the trellis; lest the serpent or birds be disturbed and cause mischief, she took the child and quietly approached. But scarcely ten steps taken, the birds all cried out once and flew into the sky. Madam Hu cursed, “You little things, what cowardice! I am so kind; would I harm you? Why such blind flight?” Before her words ended, the grass rustled and the serpent hissed; it dropped from the trellis and swiftly glided away. Madam Hu smiled and patted the child’s shoulder, saying, “See how your father sleeps so greedily; if that serpent had fallen on him, what a fright he would have had!” But as she spoke, near the trellis she looked up, suddenly cried out, and flung down the child; Madam Hu herself fell backward, fainted, foaming at the mouth. The children cried aloud in fright and pain.

What did Madam Hu see that so terrified her? This shall be revealed in the following chapter.
