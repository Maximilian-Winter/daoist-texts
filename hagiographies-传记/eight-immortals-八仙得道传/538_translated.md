# Chapter Seventy: The Manifestation of True Form Terrifies Tai Shui; A Dream Omen Dispels the Clouds of Doubt

It is related that Madam Hu, approaching near the bean trellis, opened her aged eyes to look upon her beloved son-in-law, and suddenly cried aloud, falling down in terror. The little girl she held in her arms, but four years of age, was likewise cast to the ground, crying and shouting. Presently, she turned her gaze to the old man sleeping upon the couch, and uttered a wild cry, fainting together with her grandmother. This tumult had already roused Chengfu from his sleep, who hastened to rise in alarm, hastened down and aided Madam Hu, took up the child, while Chunying and two maidservants also hurried to the scene. All were in confusion, and inquiries were made as to the cause. The girl, first to awaken, seeing that she was supported by her father, cried out loudly, struggling with both small hands, clutching only at her mother’s person, saying, “Father is not a man, father is not a man. I do not wish to be held by him.”

Chunying heard this, greatly astonished, quickly took the child in her arms and anxiously questioned Chengfu, “What is the meaning of all this?” Chengfu, hearing the girl’s words, was perplexed and could not comprehend their import. Standing bewildered and uneasy, when pressed by his wife, he said, “I myself do not know what is the matter. Now we must hasten to send (Madam Hu) back first, and then arrange matters. With all here, it is no matter.”

This word gave Chunying a reminder. She therefore took the girl and several other children—who had also heard the news and hastened thither. Chengfu stood stupefied a while, furrowing his brows, then suddenly smote his breast, his countenance darkening with killing intent. Turning, he commanded the servants, “Attend to the young masters, and do not let them run away.” Then, calling upon his courage, he personally went to carry his mother-in-law. Chunying sought to prevent him, but Chengfu said, “My mother-in-law has ever loved cleanliness, and she is an honest and proper lady. Who else would dare to carry her? I, as her son-in-law, am as my own son, so there is no matter. Moreover, she likes me, and will not find me unclean.” Chunying could but obey him. All went before, with Chengfu carrying his mother-in-law behind. They had passed within the garden gate, Chengfu yet some dozens of paces behind, walking slowly. Yet Chunying and the others plainly heard some breath issuing from Madam Hu’s throat. All thought she had awakened, and were greatly pleased. Soon all entered the main chamber, Chengfu laid her upon the bed, gently setting her down, and said, “Why is it that mother still does not speak? You all come and see; is not this—”

At these words he stopped, not uttering the sentence. Chunying heard this and knew in her heart that her mother was in extremity, hastily giving the child to the second maidservant. Coming near, she saw Madam Hu’s eyes protruded, tongue hanging from her mouth, resembling one strangled. Feeling her body, there was no breath to be found. Chunying forthwith beat the bed and the table, crying out to Heaven and Earth with lamentations. Chengfu likewise bowed by the bedside, wailing aloud.

After a time, the servants came to comfort them. Soon thereafter, their maternal uncle Deshan, together with his wife Zhang, and their son and daughter, arrived upon hearing the news. After much weeping, before they could speak, Chengfu said, “The death of my mother-in-law was most strange, her manner of death most singular. Suppose she was secretly harmed—what great enmity had she with any? Moreover, I myself carried her in, all others saw it. She did not leave my side, and yet upon the bed she was as thus. Could it be some ghostly strangling, that taking advantage of her fall and apparent stroke, took her life from my shoulders? It is hard to say. But such talk verges on the absurd. Uncle, you are the eldest relative here; what think you is the proper way to investigate?”

Deshan was a sage in his cups; so long as he had good wine and meat, he would agree to lend his head for use. Hearing Chengfu’s words, he resolved to meddle as little as might be, and said, “Nephew-in-law, your words are right. Your mother-in-law you carried in yourself; who else could silently take her life from your shoulders? To jest, even if you wished to kill her, it would not be so easy.” At this Chengfu’s face changed; he sought to speak, but Deshan continued, “Upon reflection, except for your ‘ghostly strangling’ hypothesis, there is no other reason to discuss. All are but debts from past lives, now repaid. The person is dead; best to hasten the funeral. These empty words, why speak of them?” Chengfu, hearing this, felt as if a great stone had fallen from his heart. At once all set about mourning and preparing the funeral. Much was to be done, but needless to recount.

As for Chunying, since last year when Chengfu explained the affairs of Jianye, her doubts had been dispelled. Yet now, within a short time, this strange bereavement came. She thought of her mother’s cruel death, which was surely no fright or stroke. Moreover, the girl, four years old, understood somewhat. She said, “That night, grandmother carried me to father’s side, but saw no father; only a great and enormous serpent, like the great dragon in my brother’s books. Father wore only his trousers; those trousers were plainly wrapped about the lower half of that dragon-serpent. So grandmother was frightened and fell, and threw me down. When I cried out, the thing disappeared, and I saw father rise from the couch and take me. Then mother and brothers came. Even now, when I see father, I am afraid and tremble.”

Hearing this, Chunying recalled the dreams at the births of the four children, and remembered many former doubts, combining the questions so as to form a single great enigma. She felt certain that her beloved husband must be a dragon incarnate, hence so many prodigies; with some signs perhaps even unknown to himself, so that he could not explain them. Whether he knew or not, the presence of such auspicious omens showed he was no ordinary man, and might yet have great fortune. Thinking thus, she found some comfort.

Time passed swiftly, and several years more; Chengfu’s youngest daughter was now eleven or twelve. Chengfu neither went abroad nor was seen to have distinguished friends. Though the love between husband and wife remained unchanged, Chunying did not expect him to seek fame or fortune, or titles and honours. Yet the years waned, illusions were endless, the heart secretly laboured, and she felt the strange phenomena were without foundation.

One day, Deshan and wife came for a casual talk, while Chengfu was out. Deshan’s wife You was most honest and sincere, and had ever cherished Chunying. Chunying treated them as parents, and spoke with them openly, though not daring to speak so before Chengfu. That day, they chanced upon the matter of Madam Hu’s strange death, which none understood. Chunying sent the children away, and said to You, “Nephew’s wife has a difficult question long pondered, and wishes to consult uncle and aunt. It concerns a hindrance, and she dares not speak lightly. Today speaking of mother causes me to bear no longer, and I must pour out my long-harbored words to uncle and aunt.” They asked what great matter was so weighty.

Chunying then unfolded all her doubts concerning her husband, from the day betrothal to Chengfu’s terrifying showing of his true form before his mother’s death, speaking in detail. When done, she wept bitterly, saying, “I knew my mother’s days were old, sent to the enemy, yet he had no intent to kill her. But when the matter came to light, the family would be broken, the children left to whom? Moreover, nephew’s wife had hoped that with so many prodigies, he was a man of great talent and promise, and might achieve great deeds, thus bringing honour to mother after death, so she might rest in peace. In Chengfu himself, merit might balance the wrong. Holding this thought, I kept silent then, never revealing it. Often I thought of my dead mother, praying she would not hate me for shielding my husband and not avenging her. At such thoughts, my heart grew faint. Since mother’s death, I have had many conflicting thoughts about Chengfu. One is that the mother’s murder should be avenged, and I long to expose him. Whether he sinned or not, let the law decide. Then I would have been faithful to mother. Yet I also hope he may achieve great deeds for the country, seek honour for mother, and establish a foundation for the children, thus winning forgiveness. These two thoughts have dwelt long in my breast without resolution. Yet as things stand, uncle and aunt here, I do not rashly judge him. By his wishes and acts, to be a hero is not to be expected. I do not ask him to bring glory, but since he cannot achieve success, my mother’s wish is unfulfilled. That is enough. Most strange is that he is a common man, yet has those prodigies; and since such prodigies, why no retribution? I have read that many emperors and ministers showed such signs at birth, especially dreams of a golden dragon, portending great wealth and honour. Now you, nephew and wife, not only the children share such dreams, but he himself shows his true form in sleep. Such signs are extraordinary. Why then does he show no signs of flourishing? I still doubt. I trust you, elder ones, having seen much, will know the truth.”

Deshan was cautious and anxious, fearing the nephew might act rashly; fame and wealth were less to him than safety. Hearing the words, he was stupefied, staring at his wife, unable to answer Chunying’s questions. You, though a woman, was bolder, and laughed, saying, “Nephew’s wife, you should not speak these things to your uncle. He is but a man of little courage, smaller than a mustard seed. Hearing this, his soul fled to the clouds, leaving him no resolve.” Deshan, hearing this, blushed and laughed awkwardly, “What do you say? As uncle, do I not wish my nephew great success? But I confess my learning is shallow. I am ashamed that I cannot answer your questions. Since you say so, you must have insight. You are not a stranger, and come with sincerity; please speak freely and put my mind at ease.” You laughed and spat, “You are a man of courage, yet these small things frighten you, and you always make me speak for you. Now, our niece speaks plain words, and you are afraid. She asks only a few idle questions; whether you answer or not, what harm is there? If you cannot speak, then so be it. What great matter is there that you must thrust upon me? Is it not ridiculous?” Deshan’s face grew redder. He sought to retort, but lacking skill, faltered, and You and Chunying laughed together. Chunying said, “Uncle is truly loyal and honest, even more so than aunt. Since aunt speaks thus, I hope you can help solve this mystery, and tell your niece soon.” You smiled, “Nephew’s wife speaks most amusingly. She is clever and well-read, and many men cannot match her. Can I, a country woman, unlearned and uncultured, have more insight than you? But speaking of country women, I have heard that outside the city is the temple of the Eastern Emperor, most efficacious. Many seek blessings, wealth, or children, and receive them. Since you have doubts, and we have leisure, why not prepare incense and candles, go seek a spirit lot from the great Emperor, and understand the truth?”

These words gave Chunying a hint, and she said, “Aunt is quite right; the Eastern Emperor is indeed most responsive. It is near our home; aunt, let us choose the day, or better, take today, since you both are here. Our nephew has gone out, saying he shall return only in the evening. It is but midday; we shall go quickly and return quickly, hiding it from him, so he shall know nothing. Will you promise? Let us go at once.” Deshan and You were pleased, and ordered a servant to prepare the sedan chair, incense, and candles. The three rode in chairs; in Mrs. Long’s chair was Chunying’s young son Maomao, Chunying herself took her daughter Nannan. A male and female servant accompanied, seven in all, and they went straight to the Eastern Emperor’s temple outside the city. All alighted; servants took the children to play. Chunying let her uncle and aunt first take incense; she followed, bowed devoutly several times, and sought a lot. The three gathered round, looking; the lot bore no words, but a blank slip. They were puzzled. Chunying said, “We did not choose an auspicious day nor fast or purify; surely the spirits find me insincere and refuse to grant a lot.” You advised her to try again. Chunying knelt and prayed again, silently and earnestly, long and long, and got a second lot. Unbelievably, it was the same blank slip. You tried once more, with the same result. This greatly frightened all three, who found themselves at a loss. You said, “Surely one of us has offended the spirits. Long in the temple, we have only provoked the Emperor’s dislike. Better to leave quickly.” Chunying believed this, and with spirits damped, hurried home.

Chunying had gone to dispel doubt, but returned with greater confusion. That night, she found her mind restless, tossing and turning the whole night, keeping Chengfu awake also. At first suspecting illness, he asked repeatedly, but Chunying, fearing suspicion, feigned stillness. Chengfu soon fell asleep, but Chunying wandered, until cock-crow thrice and the east grew pale, when she grew weary and slipped into a dream. There appeared a young immortal, robed in Taoist dress and crown, holding a whisk, who said, “By the Emperor’s command, your husband has offended Heaven and often eluded justice. Now his wickedness is full, and the Emperor orders me to execute him. Yet recalling your loyal nature and innocence, and that you married a villain by mistake, I warn you first. Should accidents occur, flee swiftly to your natal home, cherish no private affection, think not to act, lest you bring upon yourself endless disaster. Your visit to the temple for lots was refused by the Emperor, fearing the secret would leak. The demon is most clever; if he act first, would it not be most fearful? Therefore the utmost secrecy is needed. Know the peril and be cautious; guard against regret.” Having spoken, he departed. Chunying awoke in a sweat, the vision clear in her mind.

Reflecting on the daytime lot, she felt ill fortune was near. Yet recalling years of marriage, knowing her husband to be proper, she questioned what great sin merited Heaven’s wrath. Thus she deemed the dream but illusion, unworthy of belief. Just as Chengfu awoke, seeing Chunying still gazing, lost in thought, he was puzzled, and fearing she might fall ill, embraced and comforted her gently. He asked her feelings, but suddenly she lost composure, and thus the misfortune grew. Chunying, touched by his care, felt his deep love, and forgot the immortal’s warning. Thinking herself a wife, sharing fortune and misfortune, she resolved to reveal the dream to him, for though others could be deceived, not her husband. She told him all, clasping his waist and whispering, “Brother, think with me; how can such a dreadful dream fail to alarm?” After questioning, seeing Chengfu silent, she was astonished, and pressed her fair cheek close to his. Just as she would ask again, Chengfu’s face grew cold as iron, his eyes wide and fixed upon the darkness outside the curtain. The dawn light shone in, revealing a terrible expression. This frightened Chunying into a cry.

What caused Chengfu’s strange aspect is unknown, and will be related in the next chapter.
