# Chapter Seventy-One: The Fiend Reveals His True Nature and Tempts a Virtuous Wife; The Spread of Evil Arts Raises Storms upon the Earth

Now it happened that Chengfu, having heard Chunying relate the details of her dream, was suddenly changed in countenance, his eyes staring wildly. Chunying, whose fair face had been pressed close to his, now suddenly felt a chill, as if she were touching steel. This astonished her so that she was unable to move, holding him tightly and calling out to him without ceasing.

After some time, Chengfu gave a cold laugh, and uttered words that startled Chunying. He said, "Ah, so it is the old Donghua who seeks to trouble me, sending this child to look for me. He surely undervalues this old flood-dragon." With these words, Chunying was so surprised that she loosened her hold and sat upright, opening her bright, sorrowful eyes wide, and examined Chengfu from head to waist with earnest scrutiny, save for what was hidden from view.

Then the flood-dragon perceived that he had spoken too freely, and hastily assumed a smiling countenance, saying to Chunying: "I will tell you plainly, it is but to frighten you. Who bade you frighten others with such vague and indistinct dreams? Is it that you alone may scare me, and I may not return the jest? Look at yourself—what manner of state are you in? Can you really take dreams as truth, and think me some great malefactor, a chief offender whom Heaven will not tolerate? To speak frankly, I have neither such rank nor such qualification. You, who count yourself a wise one, treat such baseless and unreasonable phantasms as if they were matters of great moment, entangling others in frivolities so early in the morning. Ha! How shall I begin to tell you?"

Chunying noted how unnatural were his words, and, knowing that he was deliberately concealing the truth, the more he evaded, the more his furtive conduct was revealed. Resolving to lay all bare, she told him of the matter of the oracle she sought the day before, to see what further evasions he might make, and to observe the expression of his countenance. If she could thus draw forth the truth, their bond of kinship and affection might be strengthened, and if no great crime lay upon him, perhaps for the debts of former lives they might prepare early, offering their vows at the City God’s temple and performing good deeds, which might serve to dispel guilt. Should he indeed bear a great crime, beyond hope of heavenly aid, then she would decide to share life and death with him, or to seek safety elsewhere with their children; better thus than to bear a lifelong burden in silence.

Without hesitation, she related how he had once revealed his true form, how the oracle sought the day before had yielded no answer, with three successive blank slips, and the dream’s contents, asking him straightly what evil he had done. After a few queries, Chengfu looked up to Heaven and laughed coldly, answering nothing. When Chunying had finished, he asked in turn: "If I were indeed a villain of the greatest kind, long overdue for Heaven’s punishment, now full of wickedness and near death, then you, as my beloved wife, so deeply affectionate in times past, pray, what would you do with me?" Chunying was taken unawares and hesitated.

Chengfu continued: "And suppose I were innocent, and yet, through factional strife, accused as a criminal and condemned to death—then, good wife, what would you do?"

At this she could not but say, "Need not say: I would surely aid you in resisting your foes. If misfortune befell you, I would lead the children to avenge you, to the death without regret."

Hearing this, Chengfu sprang up, leapt from the bed, and bowed deeply to her, saying: "May my good wife not forget these words of today. I will now tell you all about my past and my origin, that the doubts within your breast may be dispelled."

Chunying returned the bow while donning her clothes, and they sat side by side on the edge of the bed. Chengfu sighed, saying: "In this world, not only is there no justice in the earthly realm, but even the Heavenly Emperor and immortals above have become a set of cliques and factions. We, unfortunate to be born in such times, mingle with these worldly men of faction, and cannot but suffer trouble everywhere. Good wife, I shall speak plainly to you: though we have been husband and wife many years, begotten children, and now sit side by side on this bed to converse, our daily life is like that of ordinary folk, yet the truth is otherwise. To speak frankly, I am not a mortal like you, nor like the common men of this world, but am a golden dragon of the Western Sea, a cultivated body of ten thousand years."

Having spoken, he glanced at Chunying’s countenance.

Chunying was naturally amazed beyond words. Yet, having long perceived many tokens in her mind, and suspecting that he was not quite an ordinary man, her alarm was thereby much lessened, preventing her from being overcome. Moreover, having agreed to share life and death with Chengfu, and having pressed him to speak the truth, she resolved to show a calm demeanor.

Yet, though so resolved, Chengfu observed her pale face and trembling frame, and smiling kindly, comforted her: "Dear sister, fear not. Am I not still as a mortal like you? All men have an origin: either born of beasts, or fallen immortals and spirits. Who can say that you were not in a former life a star or spirit transmigrated? Yet you know it not. I myself have never died since birth; it is not reincarnation, but transformation, and I may be deemed undying. Truly, you now share my temperament, and differ little from me; if you cultivate likewise, you may attain imperishability through countless calamities. This is a boon few obtain. You have unwittingly gained it, a great fortune indeed, and need not fear or dread."

Though half in doubt, Chunying was glad more than afraid, and nodded, saying: "Since this is so, why have you concealed it all these years, giving not a word?"

Chengfu replied: "I have long wished to tell you, to urge you to practice early and attain enlightenment, but when I once revealed my true form, my mother-in-law died of fright. I greatly feared that, once revealed, you would harbor hatred for me as a matricide. Even if not, it would cause distress within your heart; would it not hinder cultivation and ruin our affection?"

Chunying nodded again: "Since it was unintentional, how could I bear resentment? But if you are an immortal, why marry me, a mortal woman?"

Chengfu laughed: "That is beyond your knowledge. The Way of cultivation is manifold; some renounce all contact with women for a lifetime, while others rely on the union of male and female to balance yin and yang, to refine elixirs permitting ascent to Heaven. I belong to the latter, a disciple of the demonic school. Every woman I wed must be of immortal fate; with diligent cultivation, she too will become immortal. Thus we do not marry any common mortal; if she lacks such fate, the union harms me rather than benefits her. There are also those who lust for pleasure, marrying women devoid of immortal breath; after decades together, no benefit arises, and their essence is drained, falling into the mortal realm without hope of ascension, but subject to tribulation. Such things are common. Cultivation is exceedingly difficult. After a thousand years, many fail at the test of desire. Is it not perilous?"

Chunying smiled: "If so, you should be more cautious, lest your long cultivation be undone by desire."

Chengfu laughed: "That I do not fear. We most detest the injustice of Heaven, which oppresses men so cruelly. From what you saw in your dream, and what the one called Zhongli Quan told you, it is clear they intend to exterminate me."

Chunying, alarmed, said: "Though so, I think dreams are untrustworthy, and perhaps unfulfilled."

Chengfu said coldly: "No, no; what he said is well founded. They have repeatedly sought to destroy me. I am their leader’s foremost disciple, the chief among his followers, and next only to the master himself. They hate and fear me most. They have tried all means to subdue me. Among Taoists, few can match me. That year at Hua Hai village, many immortals came and were defeated by me, scattered and fleeing. Having no recourse, they hatched a vile plot, bribing my fellow disciple, the clam spirit, to betray me, turning against me unawares. This I could never have dreamed. Thus I suffered a great loss."

Chunying, moved by their bond, said indignantly: "Only such men lack conscience, and deserve death! I wonder what gains that little demon obtained by betraying you?"

Chengfu hesitated, then smiled: "Such treacherous and cruel creatures have no rise to fortune. Now he is placed under a snail spirit, named ‘Cultivator’, but truly is a mere servant and beast, driven by them. Moreover, as clam and snail are both aquatic, the clam ranks above the snail. Yet they put him under the snail’s command, a most grievous insult that only such a spirit without ambition would endure. Were he one with shame, no maltreatment could be borne; this alone would be intolerable."

"Since my defeat, I have been in hiding, obeying the master’s orders. Because my fortune is poor, I was told to keep quiet: 'Your cultivation and power exceed the Sea Dragon King’s many times; by right, that throne should be yours. But your pride alarms Heaven and incites jealousy among immortals, so the Peaceful Couple took precedence, holding the title. Their descendants now rule the great seas, dividing them among their sons Ao Guang, Ao Run, Ao Xiang, and Ao Gui. Inland rivers and lakes are guarded by their kin. You, a senior of high talent, are deemed a sinner by Heaven, with no place to dwell in all the world. Now, by my magic, you hide in the East Sea. When they discover you, war will surely follow. I desire to aid you in gaining your rightful place, but first you must secure a base inland. The Qiantang River, with its mighty currents and narrow shores, is an excellent place to establish. Formerly, the Peaceful Wife severed the dragon veins on both banks, barring the true dragon’s entry. There is also a crooked mountain path, serving as a secret way in and out. If you would undertake a great undertaking, this is your best ground.' Thus I obeyed, hiding in the sea for a hundred years, then followed the master to Qiantang’s head, surveying the land. Yet they discovered me, dispatching the treacherous Xuan Zhu to guard Haining, and some fox demon named Hui Tong, allied with the Peaceful Couple and their sons, plotting to confine me by gathering the waters of the Qiantang at Haining, besetting me so that I had no place to stand. They stationed heavy troops there, who watch more vigilantly at every tide, so that I have no foothold. In my anger, I resolved to come ashore in secret, watching for lapses in their guard, so that I might take advantage and employ my power to absorb the waters of the East Sea, flooding the houses and people within a thousand li of Haining. Thus a flood would arise, reaching north to the Yangtze and east to the sea, contending with the Peaceful Couple— a good method for retreat and battle. Upon this plan I spoke to the master, who counseled caution. I said, 'They oppress us too much; this plan I will carry out.' The master bade me be careful, and I obeyed; but I would not be restrained. The master said no more. I then assumed human form and came to Hangzhou. Such is my history before meeting you."

Hearing this much, Chunying found her flood-dragon husband to be kindly and amiable, and half her fear was allayed. She smiled and said: "That is fortunate for me. Had I not married you that year, and you had begun your magic works, would we not have perished together?"

Chengfu laughed heartily: "All under Heaven depends on destiny. We were fated to meet and be joined as husband and wife; how could you refuse me? But let me finish. I told you that immortals mostly marry and beget children to settle one mortal tie, then by adjusting yin and yang refine elixirs to ascend to Heaven. Finding no opportunity to act, my body lay idle here, so I resolved to settle this mortal tie. Coincidentally, my master sent a command by sword-light, saying my mortal tie was a woman of a certain surname, aged twenty-five this year. Good sister, that is your surname. I was astonished at such coincidence. This shows the firmness of fate, and that my thought to marry you was but the will of Heaven and Man, working without my knowledge."

Chunying asked: "You have dwelt here many years with no action. Presumably the defense is too strict for you to strike?"

Chengfu nodded: "Indeed so. That treacherous Xuan Zhu has great skill. Before I came here, a fellow disciple, disregarding orders, entered Qiantang to inspect the situation, but was driven off by Hui Tong. That disciple loved the bustling world too much, and ventured to the imperial court to serve as an official. Later discovered by Xuan Zhu, he was killed. It is a sad tale. The master said he was imprudent, acting without regard to time and place, and warned us repeatedly not to act rashly, lest we repeat past disasters and bring death. Thus I am very careful here in Zhejiang, rarely leaving home or associating with mortals, fearing to reveal our plans prematurely."

As he spoke, Chengfu stamped his foot, clenched his fist, and sighed deeply: "I never imagined, good wife, that you would heed your mother’s words and seek an oracle from the old Donghua. That was plainly giving evidence, revealing to them that in our home lie their enemies. I am the husband of your enemy! Alas, sister, it is not your fault for being meddlesome; my own conduct is suspicious. If our roles were reversed, and I were you, I too would seek oracles and divinations to learn the truth. But alas, my years of hiding and awaiting the time have been utterly undone."

Looking at Chunying, he saw her brow furrowed like spring mountains, her eyes clear as autumn waters, cheeks flushed, and hands clenched tightly, as if with no refuge, near to tears. Chengfu hastened to comfort her: "Sweet wife, do not be so. I have long said it is all fate and the time is not yet come; it concerns not you. And having heard your words of willingness to avenge me and share life and death, my heart is filled with gratitude. Even if misfortune should come, I would die content."

Having thus spoken, tears fell from his eyes. Chunying lay upon him, sobbing without end. Chengfu comforted her, and soon her grief abated.

Desiring Chunying as helper and protector of their children, to avenge their wrongs, Chengfu taught her many magical arts, bidding her learn them thoroughly. At night, in the stillness, he brought their four children to the garden. There he revealed his true form before them, and uttering incantations, touched their necks. Suddenly, the four children rose into the air, transforming into smaller flood-dragons, flying about with great delight. Chunying, at first startled, grew bold and inquired, "Since the children can take cloud and transform, can I too assume a phantom body and fly?"

Chengfu laughed heartily: "If you lack this power, how could you be said to have immortal fate? Moreover, you and I have been married many years, and you have drawn much essence from me. Such blessings surpass those gained from joint cultivation tenfold. If you doubt, you may try." With these words, he spoke incantations and breathed upon her, causing her to rise slowly into the clouds. Chengfu below made gestures and drew talismans, chanting commands. Chunying’s body was no longer her own, and she transformed into a flood-dragon. Knowing this, she was powerless. Fearing her timid heart, Chengfu beckoned her down and struck her once, restoring her human form.

He further taught mother and children the art of drawing water and creating mist. Being of kindred blood, they quickly mastered it with little instruction. Chengfu drew a bellyful of river water from beyond the Dragon Gate sluice, soared into the clouds, and sneezed downward, causing a great rain to fall. Coming down, he asked, "Do you all understand and have you learned well?" Before they could answer, a loud voice boomed from the air: "Bold demon flood-dragon, sneaking into the land with evil designs, a crime intolerable and punishable by death. You dare to seduce women! For such deeds, worse is your punishment deserved. By command of the ancestor Donghua, you are to be taken for trial and punished. Quickly bring your children to kneel bound, and you may yet receive some clemency. Should you resist, I will see your whole family perish within the hour!"

Hearing this, Chengfu and the others were greatly astonished and looked upward. There stood a young Taoist, holding a precious sword, firm upon the clouds. Chunying cried out: "This is the demon Taoist I saw in my dream; he himself said his name was Zhongli Quan, and here he is."

Chengfu, enraged, leapt upward, revealed his true form in the air, and met Zhongli Quan headlong to swallow him.

Whether Zhongli Quan survived was unknown: to be continued in the next chapter.
