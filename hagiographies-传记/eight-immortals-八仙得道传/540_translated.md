# Chapter Seventy-two: The True Way Overthrows the Evil; Divine Immortals Exercise Magic — A Bucket Holds Half the Sea, the Dragon’s Wife Seeks Revenge

Now it is told that Zhongli Quan, acting under the imperial command of the Eastern Emperor, subdued the dragon spirit, and waited aloft in the void for a fitting opportunity to strike. But the old dragon was ignorant of propriety, still training his wives there, raising clouds and sending forth rain, disturbing the people below. Zhongli Quan could no longer endure, and appeared in the sky, crying out loudly: “Foul dragon, cease your wickedness! I act by imperial order, and now seek to subdue thee.” The old dragon and his wives, hearing this, were recognized by Chunying as the very persons seen in a dream. The old dragon was greatly angered, soaring upward to reveal his true form, opening wide his blood-red maw, intent on devouring Zhongli Quan. Seeing his fierce approach, Zhongli Quan transformed himself into a magic body a hundred zhang long and ten times as broad. But the dragon’s power was vast; seeing Zhongli Quan’s great form, he would not yield. Twisting his body, he became like a rainbow in length and a mountain in thickness. Zhongli laughed, saying: “Ugly demon-slave, do you come to measure size with me, to show your wives? My magic form can be as vast as to cover heaven and earth; whatever transformations you perform, I shall still overshadow you. But today’s matter is not a trifle to be sported with. There is no time for such play, lest the people below be terrified. Open your eyes and see—now I take your life.”

The old dragon made no reply, but leapt forward again, opening wide to bite. Zhongli Quan wielded his sword, shouting: “Extend! Extend!” The sword lengthened thirty zhang or more, meeting the dragon’s mouth and thrusting in. The dragon was greatly startled, shrinking himself to his former size. Zhongli Quan would not relent, pressing forward with another stroke, cutting away a large patch of the dragon’s head, blood flowing like a flood, turning the earth within several dozen li to a rain of blood, the stench incomparable. The dragon cried out in pain, the mountains trembling, hastening to assume human form, drawing forth the hooked scythe-spear forged from his dragon body to attack Zhongli Quan. Spear and sword clashed repeatedly in dozens of exchanges. Zhongli Quan recited sacred incantations, summoning a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and generals, spreading the celestial net, surrounding the old dragon as if within an iron bucket. The dragon’s body was pierced by dozens of swords, bleeding profusely, the rain of blood growing heavier. In his anger and despair, the dragon made a fierce bound to the corner of the Eastern Sea, drawing in countless sea waters, then opening his mouth to spray upon the heavenly hosts. At once, the upper, middle, and lower worlds were one great deluge. Downstream of the Qiantang River, the waters surged and flooded, turning the land into a morass.

The heavenly soldiers and generals were driven several paces backward and forced to retreat, yet the old dragon broke through a path of blood, desperate to flee. By chance, his four children, angered by the dragon’s misfortune, came by their mother’s order to assist, each bearing weapons, bravely slaying men and joining the old dragon in hope of escaping to the lower world. But the flood was great, and the celestial guardian Xuanzhuzi, stationed at Haining, had long neglected vigilance, believing the dragon to be lurking beneath the sea and not daring to show himself. Now, upon this disastrous outbreak, he learned of the dragon’s license for havoc. Knowing the grave crime he bore, he hurriedly led his divine generals with the speed of wind and lightning to meet the foe. Just as the dragon and his sons had reached midway, Xuanzhuzi cried out: “Wicked beast, how dare you wreak havoc upon men?” and surrounded him on all sides. The old dragon and his four sons fought separately; before three rounds were completed, Zhongli Quan arrived with his divine troops, joining Xuanzhuzi. They first cleaved the four young dragons, each slain together, leaving only the old dragon alone, sorrowful, urgent, and afraid to linger in battle. He transformed into an owl and flew upward.

Xuanzhu and Zhongli Quan searched for the old dragon in vain. By chance, Erlang Shen, commissioned to patrol the three realms, saw the old dragon rise as a bird, and transformed into a great hawk, swooping upon the owl. The old dragon, alarmed, quickly changed into an eel, diving into the river. Erlang Shen revealed his true form and informed Xuanzhu and Zhongli Quan, then hastened away due to urgent duties. The two immortals restrained their troops and also pursued into the river. The eel rested by the river’s edge, but at Zhongli Quan’s sword point, the waters at once turned to ice. The old dragon, seeing the ice closing, quickly changed into a yellow dog, hiding in a privy to swallow dung.

The two immortals, disgusted by the filth and stench, did not approach. Zhongli Quan laughed at Xuanzhu, saying: “Brother Daoist, see how this demon slave is thus humbled. Our magic treasures are formed from the essence of heaven and earth, and need no such base indulgences. Brother Daoist, please withdraw the floodwaters and protect the living. I will find a helper to deal with this scoundrel.” Xuanzhu complied, wielding his sword and making gestures to disperse the waters drawn by the old dragon. Meanwhile, Zhongli Quan summoned the Thunder God and Thunder Mother, explaining the matter and requesting them to smite the old dragon with thunder and lightning. The two deities assented, swiftly preparing their rites. Zhongli Quan tightened the heavenly net so the dragon had nowhere to flee. Suddenly, under the bright blue sky, a great thunderclap resounded; the people saw the great dragon shattered into seventeen or eighteen sections, its remains and flesh scattered over seventeen or eighteen acres of fields. Thus was the long-standing evil dragon of the Western Sea finally exterminated.

Afterwards, Zhongli Quan dismissed his troops, returned the imperial command, and praised Xuanzhu’s assistance and Erlang Shen’s report. The Eastern Emperor laughed, saying: “Erlang’s aid was proper and to be expected. As for Xuanzhu, who usually guards a district and oversees what? His one great trouble was the old dragon, yet he allowed it to hide inland for decades without notice, and in the end it caused floods that harmed countless people and property. Though he assisted, it does not excuse his negligence. The Emperor has decreed: ‘He was originally a white crane refined to immortality; he is to be punished by being sent to the banks of the Xiang River, remaining a white crane guarding the river’s pass.’ Five hundred years hence, you and I must go to ferry him across. For now, he must endure his suffering.”

Having spoken thus, he sighed softly and added: “Regarding this matter, Xuanzhu was indeed negligent. If not for his wife Pinghe’s entering the mountain paths and severing the dragon’s veins, the old dragon could not have entered so far. This matter, when fully investigated, will reveal yet another great turmoil. This is a story for another time. But several decades hence, you must again journey to Hangzhou to conclude an unfinished matter; only then may your responsibilities be discharged.”

Zhongli Quan asked what this matter was. The Emperor said: “Though the old dragon and his sons are dead, his wife lives on, resolved to avenge her husband and children. This woman is originally innocent, but her method of revenge is grievously mistaken. She believes that our going to slay the dragon arose because she came to our temple to seek a divination. Were the people of Hangzhou not to believe in our gods, she could not enter the temple to burn incense; without incense, her husband’s affairs would not be revealed, and that calamity would not have occurred. Thus, following her husband’s instructions, she now cultivates day and night. When successful, she will draw half the sea’s waters, flooding all the land of Zhejiang, drowning the temple image of our gods, Xuanzhu’s magic body, and all the people and beasts of Zhejiang in one end, thus venting her grievance.”

Zhongli Quan, hearing this, was startled, saying: “I did not expect this woman to be so fierce and cruel.” The Emperor sighed, saying: “Her heart is hateful, but her resolve is pitiful. When you descend to aid the world and meet such a one, if she may be spared, you must preserve her. If she may not be spared, then kill her without hesitation; this is your own way of cherishing blessings.” Zhongli Quan knelt and accepted the command, asking: “Since the old dragon’s wife harbours a mind of revenge, and in the future if her evil grows, it is difficult to destroy her or even preserve her life, might it not be better to enlighten her now, so that she may awaken to her sin, dissuaded from wrongful toil and self-destruction? If she truly repents and returns to the Way, she shall yet have boundless blessings hereafter. Is it not better than waiting until her crime is sure and then raising arms to destroy her?”

The Eastern Emperor shook his head smiling, saying: “When one’s affliction is too great, it is difficult to calm the heart at once. Since you have slain her husband and children, first, she bears deep enmity against you; secondly, before the old dragon died, they had sworn to live and die together in hatred. Such a woman’s feelings are deepest and most earnest. Now not only her husband is slain, but her children too; this heart of vengeance cannot be dispelled by your single word. Moreover, as a lone woman in this world, living or dying, she feels that whether she takes revenge or not, death is certain. To take revenge and die is to meet her late husband in the underworld; to break her oath and live is to have no joy in life and no meeting with husband and children after death. Thus her will for revenge is firm and immovable. As for what you say of nurturing a malignant tumour, that is not necessarily so. By my reckoning, though she seeks revenge, she cannot harm a single life but will suffer herself. Though we wish to preserve her, fate is thus fixed; nothing can be done. Her future depends on whether, after suffering, she turns her heart and changes her will, returns to right and abandons evil; then plans may be made to secure her safety.” Zhongli Quan received the order and withdrew, returning the next day to Mount Hua.

Time passed swiftly, and after more than ten years, Zhongli Quan’s Dao power grew purer, his merit deeper, enabling him to travel in spirit beyond things and foresee the future. One day, while quietly refining his primal功 in a stone chamber, a sudden impulse reached his heart, and he knew the Patriarch’s command had arrived. He hastened to tidy his robes and went forth from the cave. In midair appeared a pair of red birds, descending upon the mountain, transforming into two youths. Zhongli Quan recognized them as the blue and white youths attendant to the Patriarch, and hastened to greet them: “Young brothers, you bring the Patriarch’s command.” The two youths smiled and met him. The blue youth said: “The Patriarch commands that elder brother go at once to Hangzhou.” The white youth added: “What the matter is, you will know when you have arrived.” Zhongli Quan understood at once it was the unresolved case of the old dragon ten years past. He accepted the command, invited the two youths inside, offered them fine fruits from the mountain, and they joyfully thanked him and departed.

Zhongli Quan lost no time, donning suitable garments, hanging on his sword, mounting a cloud and descending to the mouth of the Qiantang River. Considering that his usual appearance might hinder inquiries, and if he met the old dragon’s wife, who had met him twice before, she might remember and prepare, which would be undesirable, he transformed into an old woman, and using the shortening ground technique, entered Hangzhou city, wandering about for a time.

At this time, a rumour was current in Hangzhou: “The old dragon shattered by thunder once had a wife who still lives, preparing to avenge her husband, cultivating day and night to forge a water bucket. This bucket can hold the entire Eastern Sea; when her cultivation succeeds, she will come forth to harm the people.” The rumour spread widely, known to women and children. Zhongli Quan overheard and casually stopped a man, asking whence came this rumour. The man replied: “The old lady is a local; how could she not know such great matters? Now within and without the city, all know the old dragon’s wife seeks revenge. Wealthy families are moving to other provinces, leaving only the poor behind, who have nothing to lose and cannot flee, resigned to their fate.”

Zhongli Quan further asked: “This wife of the old dragon must be a female dragon. Her husband had great power, yet was reduced to flesh and blood, life not preserved. Could the female dragon’s Dao be higher than her husband’s?” The man laughed: “In the past when the old dragon rebelled, heavenly soldiers descended to extinguish him. Now, whether divine persons come to protect us, how could mortals know? They say in old times, Thunder God and the Immortal came together to beat the dragon to a pulp. But the blood rain and flood were enough for us to endure.”

Zhongli Quan pondered a while. The man chattered on, recounting past and present affairs. Zhongli Quan nodded along, then asked: “The female dragon causes trouble, yet issues no proclamations or orders; how then do you know?” The man replied: “There is reason for this. The female dragon was not truly a dragon, but a lady of the local Yin family, named Miss Chunying. She was once beguiled by the old dragon and married him. After the old dragon’s death, celestial troops slew her four children. A woman blessed with good fortune was thus ruined and bereft. She had sworn before her husband, promising to avenge him, hence these matters. It is said she has an aunt who repeatedly advised her against this cruel and unnatural course. But she never consented. The aunt is a good person, over sixty years old, who personally went about urging neighbors to prepare early against the flood disaster. From that, the tale spread, and now few families do not know of it. Yet many stout men say this is all nonsense and advise others not to believe it. One former official, Lord Liu, accused the old lady of spreading lies and inciting the people, deserving death. He notified the authorities to arrest her, but neighbors rallied in defense, saying she was a good woman wrongly accused. There was a commotion, and the palace dared not act against her.”

Zhongli Quan nodded: “So it is. But does the woman seeking revenge still live in the city?” The man shook his head: “She is now a perfected one, coming and going without trace, able to change shape endlessly, invisible. Who knows where she lives? Yet according to her aunt, she often returns home and yearly visits her husband’s grave to offer sacrifices. So she comes often, but cannot be found.”

Zhongli Quan smiled: “If so, please tell the people that the female dragon’s revenge is true. But heavenly gods have sent divine beings to subdue her, and this time the defence is thorough; there will be no blood rain or flood disaster. Ask those who wish to move far away not to act rashly. Those who remain may live peacefully, without fear or loss of livelihood.” Before he finished, the man scowled, spat several times at him, and cursed: “What wicked old woman is this? I kindly tell you, and you mock me with your words. When the flood comes, our strong men still have a chance, but you decrepit old crone will only crawl underground as fish food. Let us see if you still joke then!”

Having said this, he turned and left, paying no further heed. Zhongli Quan laughed heartily, so that the man, unaware, glanced back, only to see a flash of golden light. Zhongli Quan had risen within the shining radiance into the clouds. Many bystanders witnessed the spectacle. The man, frightened, knelt and kowtowed, shouting: “Great Immortal, forgive my blindness and rude speech. I shall now comply with your command and report to every household.” The idle onlookers, seeing Zhongli ascend, also joined the man in reverence. After worship, they asked what had happened. The man gesticulated and related the above events, then called on the people to bear witness and separately notify each household. Immediately, a new rumour spread in Hangzhou: that a celestial being had descended to subdue the female demon, and the people would be spared disaster.

This news soon reached the ears of Chunying’s aunt, Lady You, a truly warm-hearted woman. She hurried to notify her niece, tearfully advising her not to act rashly. First, to avoid harming innocent lives; second, to avoid repeating her husband’s tragic fate. But Chunying did not think so. She said: “Niece has long resolved to act, caring not for success or failure, profit or loss. Alone in this world, life and death alike. Let the heavenly gods and generals come to slay me—death is my will. To live thus is no different from death. Even if revenge succeeds and my grievance is vented, the emperor and immortals will be drowned utterly, and most of the city’s people drowned with them. My husband’s resentment may be relieved, but I shall remain as before. My wish is only for peace of heart; if revenge is achieved, I will die and return to truth, no longer wandering the mortal world. If revenge fails and I die by the gods’ hands, that too is fitting for them and me. I hope aunt preserves her blessings and no longer worries about me. Now that the world knows this, the danger is pressing; niece must act at once.”

Lady You wept and left, seeing no hope of dissuasion. Chunying transformed into an old woman, taking up the water bucket she had painstakingly forged by her husband’s secret method, drawing in the waters of the Eastern Sea, fastening the bucket’s mouth with a fine silk cord, carrying it upon her shoulder as she walked, preparing to ascend to the highest peak of the City God Mountain, where from that lofty place she would pour down the flood, drowning lands for hundreds of li around. She also prepared a sharp blade, resolved that when the waters rose, she would slit her throat and enter the flood, perishing with all the gods and immortals, thus manifesting her intention and fulfilling her husband’s final promise.

After some journey, she reached the foot of City God Mountain, carrying the water bucket, stepping up. At the mountain’s midway point, weary, she set down the bucket and rested awhile. Sitting a moment, she gazed at the sky, clear and serene as a painting; listening to the wind through pines, her heart was moved, and she recalled her life’s course. Since her father’s death, her old mother reared and taught her, arranging her marriage. For ten-odd years, her heart and strength were exhausted. At last she had such a good husband as Wang Chengfu, relying on him as half a son, so that mother and daughter might live without care. But alas, the family tragedy began then. Her mother died of fright at Chengfu’s revealed form; she herself, because of Chengfu, was left alone, homeless, without a place to stand. Now she must bear the burden of revenge. Though success is uncertain, this life’s long course is near its end. Thinking thus, her heart was cut as by a knife. Looking about and seeing no one, she lifted her eyes and wept aloud. Suddenly a voice behind asked: “Madam, for what cause do you, alone and sorrowful, wander this mid-mountain place?” Chunying was startled, turned, and saw a young girl unknown to her.

Whence came this child? The story will be told in the next chapter.
