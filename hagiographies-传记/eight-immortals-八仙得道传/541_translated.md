# Chapter Seventy-Three: The Widow’s Heart Urges Reformation, One Breath Absorbs the Ocean

Now it is said that when a man is about to die, except for the decrepitude of old age and the failing of breath, like a lamp whose oil is spent and the flame about to go out, the life flickers and wanes. Those who complete the term allotted to them, whether in full strength of years or by sudden sickness or by self-inflicted death, though their bodies perish, their spirits do not disperse. After death, such spirits may indeed become malignant ghosts. At the very moment of their passing, there must be many reflections,—sometimes reviewing their past life, sometimes pondering the days to come. In all, there is inevitably some measure of reluctance to part with the world in which they once dwelt; this surely is a fixed principle.

In the previous chapter we recounted how the old flood-dragon’s wife, the young lady Chunying, burdened with a heart full of grief and wrath, bore upon her shoulders half an ocean, and fully intended to ascend to the summit of the City God’s mountain, there to act with the whole world in unison according to this will. To call it cruel is to call it cruel to the utmost; to call it heroic is to call it heroic to the extreme. Especially when such deeds proceed from the hand of a woman, one feels that this cruelty and heroism are things unseen since heaven and earth were created. The noble gentlemen who carefully discern reason and sentiment, when suddenly encountering this, though they do not accuse the author of exaggeration, yet with regard to Lady Chunying herself, they dare not believe she is of ordinary human kind; this much may be asserted. And according to all that the author knows, the matter is indeed as cruel and heroic. Moreover, the one who directs it all is truly a lady of gentle birth and advanced years. Precisely for this reason, before she set about her undertaking, she had reflections deeply consonant with human feeling. From these reflections, one may infer the character and aspirations of this Lady Chunying; she is not simply the cruel and heroic person as described above, but indeed a woman of great purity, chastity, and extraordinary tenderness.

It is for this very reason that the gentlemen feel more strongly the incongruity between the person and the deed. The author, therefore, ventures to sum up in a single phrase: matters great or small depend upon the spirit of the person. When the will is as firm as a mountain, and the breath as vast as the sea, it is possible for a frail woman to undertake affairs of state. Otherwise, even possessing power to govern well or to be lord of the realm, if one be timid and fearful, the end will be only an imbecile and weak ruler, accomplishing nothing of note, not worth speaking of. Enough of empty words; let us now strike at the heart of the matter, and proceed to the main text.

At that time, as Chunying was recalling the past and lamenting aloud to the sky, suddenly she heard a voice from behind: “Madam, you grieve excessively—why have you come to this hillside and begun to wail? Is there some grievous wrong you suffer?” Turning, Chunying saw a young girl with hair hanging down, standing smiling upon a rock, gazing upon her with eyes that would not let go. Chunying had no mind to engage with her, but seeing the maiden lively and charming, fair and intelligent, she found her very lovable, and was somewhat reluctant not to answer. Then she recalled her own childhood, when she too loved climbing mountains and crossing streams, and was fond of meddling in other people’s affairs. Whenever she went out and met the poor and despondent, she always sought to help them as best she could. Now she saw in this girl a likeness to herself in looks and manner, also fond of meddling and loving the mountains; thus their natures coincided. So suddenly her withered heart seemed to receive moisture from the dew, and she felt a slight stirring of life. In her mind, the feelings were neither sweet nor bitter, neither sour nor sharp, but she did not trouble herself to distinguish. In short, she had no courage to refuse the girl’s questioning, that was certain.

She ceased her tears and held back her sorrow, nodding to the girl, saying: “Young maiden, you are the person most upright and joyful under heaven, and also the happiest one in the world. How could it be known that under the same heaven, in the same world, and even in the same life, from youth to old age, one might, without cause or reason, unknowingly and suddenly enter a path where men cannot tread? The joys and happiness of youth all end in contrary results. At this time, there is indeed a state where one cannot be born, nor can one die swiftly. Young maiden, tell me, is such a life easily endured? Can one continue such a life? But—ah, ah—dear little maiden, gentle little sister, such words, how can they enter your ears now? Not to speak of others, but myself: when I was your age, if any one had spoken these words to me, I would not have believed them. Though you are warmhearted and caring about me, I cannot answer your words. Not only cannot, but need not. For if I tell you the whole matter, you may not believe it. Nor do I care to waste my little time in idle talk with you. Young maiden, forgive me, I must go now; farewell.”

Having thus spoken, she rose, took up her water bucket, and hurried away. The girl, smiling, stepped forward and seized the bucket, saying: “Mother, do not go. Even if you do not tell me, I shall not ask you, to spare your grief. But why rush away so quickly? The day is yet early; would it not be better to sit a while longer?” Chunying was held fast by the hand on the bucket, unable to go, and hearing the girl call her mother, with tone and manner most affectionate, her heart was moved again. Suddenly she recalled her own children; involuntarily she stood still, her body numb as if struck by a thousand needles, staring at the girl motionless. The girl quickly took the bucket from her and placed it upon a stone bench, smiling, saying: “Mother, do not be impatient; if there is trouble, think of a way; step by step you will pass through it. After bitterness comes sweetness; the happy days lie still ahead!”

Hearing this, tears rained from Chunying’s eyes. Though she said she had no time to sit, her body unconsciously sank down, and she began to weep aloud. The girl comforted her for a while; seeing her cry without ceasing, she sat silently waiting. Chunying’s heart was naturally grateful, so she wiped her tears away and sobbed: “I understand your kindly intent, young lady. But I cannot accept your good words. For in this world I have long been left alone and solitary. I neither make my own good fortune, nor have I one or two kin to share a star of happiness with me. So my life may be said to have no path to live by. If there be no path to live, much less can there be happiness. Yet by your kindness, meeting by chance on the water, and your care for me, I feel much gratitude. Ten years ago, I looked upon heaven as full of upright gods, and the world full of good men. But in the past ten years, I have seen no good men on earth, nor even an upright immortal in the celestial courts. Perhaps it is my ill fate and narrow vision. Yet knowing this, and having no strength left to rescue myself, I find no peace in my heart and mind if I do not believe all gods and men to be bad. Young maiden, do not laugh at me or blame me. I regret I cannot now fully tell you my story; but—ah—indeed—young maiden, you are a person of heart. I think if you have great blessing and fortune... no... no... I see you are fair and wise, your forehead bright and full, your face upright and kind, your bearing and manner everywhere showing a profound and elegant dignity, neither vulgar nor frivolous. Surely, you must have great felicity and good fortune. Since that is so, I may judge in advance this one thing: soon you will know what sort of person I am; what great griefs and resentments, loneliness and anguish, brought me to this place and to this mountain, and what I have done and will do. The outcome, and my own fate, are things you need not ask, but will know in time. For looking at me on the surface, I am but an old woman, helpless and worthless. Yet, young maiden, alas... it is a pity I cannot now explain in detail. In brief, I can say that I am not like an ordinary old woman. The terrible events I have undergone are not such as an ordinary woman could endure. Hence my affairs differ greatly from those of ordinary women, and may serve for stories told now and in the future, even thousands of years hence. Young maiden, think: am I a formidable old woman, or not? Moreover, understand that I, such an old creature, possess such mighty magic that I can stir the hearts of all the peoples of the world, and endure without decline for ever. By what power and effect could this be? No, no, no; in any case, I am but a woman, how could I have such strength and influence? Simply put, this is the outcome of the terrible calamities I suffered ten years ago. Young maiden, just by my enduring without decline to become a folk tale, you may know the weight of my sorrow and tragedy. Do not say that a woman, living or dying, is worthy of great deeds; yet how else can it be said that I am so mighty? Now, young maiden, our talk today has no record, no written proof; soon you will know for yourself. Whether my words be true or false, whether it be worthy of such exaggeration, you may judge. There is no need for me now to swear or take oath to prove it. But before all, I have one serious thing to declare. The so-called tale of my enduring without decline is not boasting, nor a good deed to benefit my native place or the commonalty. To put it plainly, it is but a great evil for which men heap curses and hatred upon me.”

When Chunying had spoken thus, the girl could not help but smile and ask: “Mother, all you say I fully believe; but from your meaning, it seems you are now about to do a great evil, preparing to cause the death of many people, is it not so? Though I dare not ask what kind of evil it is, I cannot believe that any one knowingly would do evil, knowingly intending harm, just to try it once. I see you are a person of upright spirit, so why knowingly commit such harm? Moreover, if you gain some benefit from the evil deed, it might be worth doing. But now I hear many lofty words, and it seems you yourself desire no good from it, even after doing such a thing, you yourself wish no longer to live in this world, yet you are to be cursed and hated by countless generations. Why suffer this? Though I am but a child, my parents taught me to read and understand reason, and I know some principles of conduct. Only in your words and deeds today I find myself confused.”

Chunying, hearing her clear speech and quick wit, was greatly amazed, and could not help but look her over from head to foot. Then she sighed, and said: “This matter is not for you to know. If you ask too much, you will become a foolish child. In short, my affairs, because of the cruel fate beyond reason, produce deeds beyond reason. For this reason, they become strange matters hard to understand. If, as you see, all were matters of feeling and reason, then I should never have existed in this world. Since I do exist, I should not be doomed to suffer retribution so incompatible with my person and deeds. Young maiden, I deeply appreciate your sincere exhortations. We meet in this life as drifting water, your age is too young, and my affairs too late. We suffice not to be companions in the inner chamber. If fate allows, in the next life we shall become friends and kin. I wish always to receive your teachings and be a good and reasonable person. As for this life and this world, our meeting is now, our farewell is also now. Even if we were to be close friends, the time is too short. Yet I have one more serious declaration. I do not now say, as I have said for ten years, that in heaven there are no upright gods, and on earth no good men. But seeing you now, I dare no longer harbor such thoughts. For in our brief encounter, in this moment, your loving and gentle exhortations have brought a great and swift change in my heart. I dare no longer say that heaven and earth are all devils. I think that all misfortune is my own strange fate, unrelated to heaven, earth, gods, or men. Thinking so, my spirit is much calmed. Young maiden, this also is the good lesson you have given me in so short a time. The ancients said, ‘If one hears the Way early, one may die contentedly at dusk.’ To-day, having received your teaching, I may be said to have heard the Way. I feel this change in my heart, and my body is much refreshed. Alas! I never expected that my mad opinions of the past ten years would be turned back so quickly by your pure and innocent heart. Young maiden, you truly are a good physician of my conscience. You have partly healed my dead conscience; though my body dies, this healed conscience, even after reincarnation or in hell, will know to be grateful to you.”

The girl, seeing her speak so sincerely and mournfully, showed a hesitating and gentle expression, then smiled and asked: “Mother, I dare not take your words lightly. If you value your conscience, why then do you do such evil? If you would not harm yourself, and would keep this part of your conscience, then compare the lives and goods of the many harmed with this part of your conscience; the difference is plain. Why then do you cherish the small and abandon the great? Why treat yourself so kindly, but others so harshly? Moreover, if you value your conscience and yet do evil against it, how will you answer for yourself?”

Chunying was stunned; after a long while she suddenly laughed, saying: “Young maiden, I do not believe one so young can possess such knowledge and eloquence; with a few words you have left me, an old woman weathered by the world and worn by years, without answer. But, young maiden, I must ask you to love and forgive me. I have already said, my affairs are not of common reason. From the moment of my calamity to its final evil outcome, all is beyond human feeling and reason, outside of common principles. Young maiden, you may overturn my reason, but my deeds follow another path, beyond debate; I must rely on your kindness to bear with me.”

The girl, seeing her so obstinate, was also taken aback; the two sat silently facing each other for some time. Chunying suddenly rose, forced a smile, and said: “Young maiden, let us part; the day grows late. Though there are no tigers or leopards here, many evildoers haunt this place. You have been out long, and should return early, lest your parents at home be anxious. If fate allows, we shall meet again in another life, and form a friendship then. I gladly accept your teaching, and will strive to be a reasonable person. As for this life, our meeting and our farewell are now. Though friends, our time is too short.” At these words, her voice was half hoarse. The girl, moved, blushed deeply, and was near tears. But Chunying suddenly took up her bucket, showed a pale face, smiled bitterly once more to the girl, spoke no more, and hastened away.

The girl, seeing her depart, rose hastily to pursue, again seizing her little bucket, and said mournfully: “Mother, you must go, you must do your work. I dare not detain you, nor again waste your time. But our meeting to-day is no chance occurrence; please give me something, a token. For I shall never forget your countenance and manner all my life, and shall wish never to part from you. Since that cannot be, give me some token, that I may see it and think of you, as though we met always. Mother, is this not possible?”

Hearing these sincere words, Chunying felt she could no longer refuse. But she had nothing to give, and pondered. The girl added: “If you have nothing to give, then please let me drink some water from your bucket. Carrying your water in my belly, I will at every meal remember you. Our meeting in the mountains will seem as if we were always together. Mother, what think you?” Chunying smiled broadly, saying: “So be it; young maiden, come and drink.” She sat down again, opened the bucket, and handed it to the girl.

The girl looked into the bucket at the mouth, then suddenly shook her head: “No, no.” Chunying anxiously asked: “Why not? Is the water not clean? It is sea-water, though salty, but very fresh.” The girl shook her head, laughing: “Not so. I see you rise and move, reluctant to part with this bucket. This water must be of great use; it cannot endure my few sips. Having drunk your water, what then?” Chunying could not help laughing loudly: “Young maiden, do not belittle this little water; if it were only for drinking, it would at least supply…” She broke off mid-sentence, regretting her words. Such matters should not be told to others. So she stopped, changed her tone, and said: “Young maiden, drink boldly; do not pity this water. If you can drink it all, I will be your host.” The girl laughed: “If so, Mother, do not speak so generously, lest you repent and make me spit out the water to return it. Do not say I have not the power; the dirty water I spit out will only serve to fertilise your fields.” Seeing her playful persistence, Chunying laughed and loved her, yet was somewhat impatient, saying: “No nonsense, drink quickly. I will not regret it, nor ask you to return it.” The girl, hearing this, laughed lightly, raised the bucket to her small mouth and poured. One heard the gurgle of swallowing, then she raised the bucket, inverted it with mouth to ground, base to sky, shook it before Chunying, and said: “Truly, Mother, you do deceive people; there is but a little water, how can you say so much of the sea?” Before the words were finished, Chunying fell back stunned, speechless for a long while.

Who this girl was, and why she carried such a great belly full of half the sea’s water, remains to be told in the next chapter.
