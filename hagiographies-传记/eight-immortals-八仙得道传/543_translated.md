# Chapter 75: The Immortal of Dajing Alley Preserves Ancient Traces; The Ghost Official of White Cloud Mountain Seeks the Famous Master

Now it is related that after Master Xu the Perfected saved and delivered the female flood-dragon, he opened a fissure of heavenly light beneath the City God’s mountain, and granted her a source of water and a place of refuge; moreover, he promised that when her cultivation was accomplished she would surely attain the brightness of enlightenment. This was originally a phrase of the cultivators of the Way; but it gave rise to a great misunderstanding among the common folk. In the preceding chapter it was told how the people of Hangzhou, at the cave opened by the Perfected Xu, made a great well, a place where the multitudes might drink. Afterwards, tradition was handed down among the people that this well was used by the Perfected Xu to subdue the flood-dragon, and that it was as if one might see the light of dawn, and that the female flood-dragon had emerged therefrom. Therefore, the people warned one another that at evening-tide no lamp should be brought near the well, lest the female flood-dragon come forth.

This well exists even to the present day, and the people of Hangzhou have named the place Dajing Alley. The saying forbidding lamps near the well still lies deeply fixed in the hearts of the common folk; the elders hand down the warning to their children. A single phrase, born of misunderstanding, has thus spread for more than two thousand years; this is indeed most laughable. But that is another matter and need not be further spoken of. As for the saying that the Perfected Xu allowed the female flood-dragon to attain the Way and become an immortal after three thousand years, that time is not yet come. Since the fact has not been revealed, it is even harder for the writer to conjecture, and so it is left unexamined.

Now the book must mention one person again, namely, a disciple of Wang Yizhi, whose name is Fei Changfang. Since the death of Wang Yizhi, Fei Changfang has fully transmitted his master’s techniques, and by diligent application and effort in some respects has even surpassed Wang Yizhi himself. Therefore, upon Wang Yizhi’s death, the office of managing ghosts and spirits devolved upon him. But this post was of low rank, and moreover involved daily dealings with shades and spirits, the yin energy being overpowering. Also, because of his supervision over fierce ghosts, he inevitably incurred many ghostly enmities. When Wang Yizhi was alive, he also was unwilling to take on this troublesome and resentment-breeding business. All because he had not attained the Way, and had lately met with a great calamity, so that it was already fortunate enough to preserve the leader from hell’s torment. Moreover, having been promoted by Iron Crutch and appointed to this post, how could he have further ambitions? He continued in office until he was condemned and met death, a period of not less than a hundred years, before passing the position to Changfang. Changfang was younger and of lofty ambition. Having entered the path of the Dao, how could he not hope to attain the rank of heavenly immortal? Furthermore, seeing the long tenure of his master, and that by occasional carelessness he had eventually died a violent death, it was clear that such things were meaningless. At that time, compelled by the decree of Heaven, he reluctantly complied. Yet he resolved to advance diligently, not daring for a moment to be idle, in hope of ascending to the heavenly realm. Through myriad tribulations and unshaken sincerity, the response would surely come.

By chance, Master Wenmei passed through that region, and hearing that there was such a devout cultivator of the Great Way, he resolved by swordlight to summon his disciple Zhang Guo to test Changfang to see if he had the blessing to become an immortal.

Zhang Guo, obeying orders, came forth; on the way he met the companions Lan Caihe and He Xiangu, who were at leisure wandering. The three met and inquired of each other’s purpose. Zhang Guo invited them to accompany him, and the two immortals gladly consented. Together they mounted clouds and proceeded.

At the border of Luoyang, to the place where Fei Changfang dwelt, they sought a vacant spot and alighted, transforming themselves into common Daoists, and made direct way to Changfang’s home to pay their respects. Changfang was concentrating on his cultivation; hearing that fellow Daoists had come to see him, he was naturally very pleased. He straightened his collar and received them with due ceremony, seating them with due reverence. After inquiring their surnames, the three immortals gave fictitious names and said, “We come from Lingnan. Having heard that your cultivation is profound, and that you command the spirits of all under Heaven, you are truly a man of talent, wisdom, and virtue. Therefore, though we may be rude in our intrusion, we have come to pay homage.” Now although Changfang held a humble post, he was often arrogant and proud, and throughout his life most hated to hear others speak of his dealings with ghosts, as he took it for an insult, plainly regarding it as a sign that he lacked the qualifications for cultivation of the Way. His friends, knowing his temper, refrained from mentioning the word “ghost” in his presence, out of respect for his aversion.

Unexpectedly, these three uninvited guests at their first word lauded his career. Changfang, hearing such words, could not help but blush deeply; he could neither admit nor deny. As strangers had come from afar to pay their respects, it was not proper to offend them, so he muttered a few words and hurried to change the subject. But the three were all simple folk, ignorant of worldly ways and unable to read human countenances. The more Changfang detested them, the more they clung to him, taking up the topic of ghost management and discussing it with him, questioning the state of ghost governance, and what fierce ghosts he had seen. Then they spoke of his master Wang Yizhi, how foolish he was and how he suffered. Their various jibes were as if knowingly provoking, as if partners in mischief who had come specially to tease him. Changfang could no longer endure this; unable to offend his distant guests, he resorted to the method of taking up the lute and singing, feigning preoccupation and laziness in answering. They asked three or four questions, to which he only coldly replied half a word. The three, however, paid little heed and kept on talking, never ceasing to mention ghosts and spirits.

In his heart, Changfang judged these three noble guests as not really strangers from afar coming to seek him out because of admiration or respect; rather, they must have had some grievance with him from before. Or else they might be his master’s enemies, and now that the master had passed to immortality, they came to take vengeance upon his disciple. Certainly those who come with goodwill do not come thus. Since their aim was revenge, he resolved to be most yielding, yet was by no means minded to give up. Moreover, in his youthful vigour he would not easily show weakness. Hearing their continued discourse, he bowed and said, “I most humbly beg pardon of you three. I am charged with the office of supervising spirits; first, to carry on the unfinished business of my late master; secondly, as I have no other occupation, I am glad to play this ill-tuned lute, and serve the people of the locality. I do not disdain this lowly post; but indeed my heart is not set on it. It is a pity that this is our first meeting, and we are strangers, so it is not convenient to speak at length nor speak of the subtle details. But I trust that since this is our first acquaintance, there is no relationship between us. Yet from the moment you entered until now, you have spoken only ghostly words. I do not lightly suspect you of dealing with a band of fierce ghosts; but I do not believe you were sent by any authority to investigate my post. I have always been hospitable, especially to fellow Daoists. But today, meeting your various discourses, I am greatly disappointed. Pray, tell me plainly what you have to instruct, and why you speak not of human affairs but only of ghosts.”

Having said this, he put on a stern face and fell silent. The three immortals heard this and laughed heartily one to another, saying, “Sir, you are indeed a singular man who bears grudges against the world. According to the wishes of men nowadays, if not in the official world of the living, then at least in the infernal regions below, an office as a clerk or subordinate official would be good enough. We did not think that you, bearing so heavy a charge, should be dissatisfied with it. It is plain that men differ in their range of mind and in the loftiness or baseness of their aims. But we would ask, what is your aspiration? What noble employment do you pursue in life? May we hear?”

At first Changfang, full of courtesy and humility, received the three, thinking that these strangers had come with earnest respect and might well instruct him. But after their words stirred his heart to anger, he no longer regarded them seriously, and answered coldly, “Each man has his own ambitions, differing as widely as their faces. Our acquaintance is as floating waterweed; there is no relation between us. I was too busy to inquire concerning your background, and yet you would know of my aims—surely this is meddlesome.”

Zhang Guo, seeing that he was moved, hastened to smile and apologize, saying, “We have not met before, and did not know that you undertake your present post so grudgingly and without sincerity. We imagined that your aspirations were a hundredfold loftier than your present charge. We were not previously aware, and did not mean to be abrupt. We pray forgiveness. We only asked your aims out of admiration for your spirit and a wish to befriend you. How can a man of your spirit and virtue be angered so fiercely at a single word? It seems your magnanimity is somewhat lacking. One so narrow in mind and small in breadth can only serve as a subordinate in the infernal offices, filling ghostly posts. The Way of the Immortals is not suitable for such a one. Or else you have other ambitions, which may surpass the immortals. Should your aim be to cultivate immortality, or to pursue affairs akin to immortals, it seems not a course within your capacity. We hope you will consider this judiciously.”

Changfang intended to be cold to avoid further entanglement; yet angered, and made a laughing-stock, even insulted to his face, how could he endure? Presently his face flushed, veins stood out, and his whole countenance showed displeasure. But considering Zhang Guo’s words, he saw the truth therein. So he turned his thoughts: “Whatever the character of these visitors, they have something to say. As for myself, I should be especially friendly and humble, so as to raise my own station and show the broad and lofty mind of a cultivator. To take offence at a mere word and ask angrily is the act of a mean-spirited man, unworthy of emulating.” With this thought, his anger vanished, and he bowed to Zhang Guo with a smile, saying, “Your visit has brought me great benefit in this one word. How could I fail to receive it with reverence? I will not conceal that my life has been ill-fortuned; from youth I stood alone, lacking the instruction of the court. Later I learned from my late master Wang Yizhi the methods of talismans and incantations, which have no relation to the Great Way. When my master passed away, I intended to abandon home and wander in search of a famous master; but fate compelled me to succeed him in his office. Though able to conduct affairs without hindrance, my duties distracted me from specializing in profound principles, which grieves me and is a source of regret. Unexpectedly, you three, coming from afar, do not assist me by the orthodox Way, but instead irritate me with the very things I secretly resent, without ceasing to mock and ridicule. Though this is not your intention, I cannot but feel great disappointment, and my displeasure is plainly seen in my words and manner. This is the truth.”

The three immortals heard this and nodded to one another, saying, “A boy may be taught.” Their six eyes looked at one another, and they rose from the ground, whereupon the courtyard was filled with multicoloured auspicious clouds, rising gently into the air. The chamber was filled with a fragrance unknown to the world, refreshing the mind and spirit. Changfang was greatly astonished and alarmed; he hurriedly looked upward, and saw the three immortals standing amidst the clouds, smiling down upon him. Changfang hastily knelt and kowtowed, exclaiming, “Three Immortal Masters, just now your disciple was blind and unseeing, and spoke rashly. I pray the Immortal Masters will have pity on my sincere heart, forgive my faults, and graciously accept me, inscribing my name on the gate-posts, so that your disciple may early escape the sea of suffering. For all my days I shall be grateful for your great virtue.” Zhang Guo, hearing this, waved his hand from the clouds, bidding him rise, and then told of his own origin. He said, “If you have sincerity, you may come within three days to the summit of White Cloud Mountain in the western city. There is an ancient temple there, where the three of us shall be, and there will be the transmission of the wondrous Way. Arrive within the appointed time, nor be early nor late.” Having said this, the multicoloured clouds coalesced, and the figures vanished.

Changfang bowed and arose, returning to his inner chamber. His wife had long since died, and recently he had taken another, a lady of a great family, both accomplished in talent and beauty, a most devoted couple. When she saw her husband return, she asked, “Who has called upon you today, that you talk at this time of day?” Changfang smiled and said, “To cheer my lady’s heart: I have never believed in worldly wealth and honours, but have sought only immortality and the Way. Today indeed three true immortals, moved by my sincere heart, came to give me instruction, and bade me come the day after tomorrow to the summit of White Cloud Mountain in the western city to receive the ultimate teaching face to face...”

Before he finished, his wife spat out, “My lord is truly mad. Who does not know that White Cloud Mountain is full of tigers and leopards and the like, which wound many each year? Though you have some powers, you can only deal with men. If you meet wild beasts that understand no spirit, you will be powerless. Why risk yourself for so vain a thing?” Changfang shook his head and said, “I have the art of shrinking the earth, and can in a single step reach the mountain’s summit. Though there be wild beasts, they cannot catch me. Besides, a cultivator of the Way thus fearing death and misfortune on every side were better to live one’s life simply and without cultivation.”

His wife urged him repeatedly, but Changfang would not consent. He thought, “Immortals say not to speak of these matters at home, yet I must go to this dangerous place; it is probably a test of my sincerity. If I use the shrinking earth art and leap there at once, it will be no different from staying at home, and the immortals will laugh at me as a pretender, greedy and lazy. This will not show my sincerity.” So he concealed his plan from his wife, secretly prepared some provisions, and early next day stealthily left home to proceed to White Cloud Mountain. His wife only guarded against his later departure, and so was taken unawares by his earlier setting forth, left anxiously awaiting his return.

Though Changfang dwelt near at hand, he had never before ascended the mountain, for it was full of fierce beasts; the paths were little known. After asking at several places, he reached the foot of the mountain. That very night, looking upon the mountain’s form, he saw it was very steep. Though there was a small path, it was exceptionally narrow. One unused to mountain roads, having just reached the first slope, was already breathless and soaked with sweat, utterly exhausted, yet dared not rest. Encouraged by the moonlight, he pressed onward along the path. After some more journey of several li, his legs grew weak and his body could no longer support him; the moonlight flickered dim and bright, and while bright the path could be discerned, but when clouded and dark, even the path was lost to sight. Changfang, at this point, felt that it was impossible to proceed; so he chose a stone block and sat to await the dawn.

Through the night he heard the howling of tigers in the valley, and saw mountain ghosts roaming. The ghosts feared his presence and could not harm him; but the tigers and wolves were beyond his control. Fortunately he had the shrinking earth art, to be used should beasts attack, to avoid them. Yet though so, he waited until daybreak without once using it. His soul and courage were frightened almost out of his body. Moreover, a strange thing befell him: his shrinking earth art here was utterly useless.

This happened the next day. Having run so hard, he could not help a faint desire to use his power secretly, thinking, “Now that I am close to the summit, it will be no great disrespect to the immortals to employ my art.” Thus he used his power. Originally a single step could cover ten thousand steps; yet, fearing blame, he reduced his power so that one step counted as ten steps. But at the same time as he shortened the distance, the mountain path seemed to lengthen. Clearly before him was a certain mark, the goal to be reached in one step. But when he opened his eyes at the spot, he found himself still eight or nine steps away. By calculation, his step was still only a single step. Changfang was greatly alarmed. He thought that his master had never taught anything that failed; why today this change? This must be the illusion of the three immortals, deliberately making things difficult. The fearful and terrible things he saw the previous night were also their tests, to see if he had courage. If he should shrink back at danger and retreat, or use his art at the outset, the immortals would see that he had no sincerity. Now that the danger was nearly past and the summit in sight, he hurried on, so that the immortals could not say he was unworthy, nor refuse to transmit the Great Way. He looked at the sky and ate some refreshments, resolved to struggle on to the peak, his heart set more than half.

After resting, he rose and resumed his ascent. Seeing the mountain peak in view, and a broken temple on the summit where the immortals must await, his heart was glad, his spirit revived; he cared not for broken shoes nor aching limbs. At last he climbed the summit and stood firm, lifting his head to look, and could not but utter a cry of distress.

How it was that Changfang, having reached the summit, yet met with difficulty, shall be explained in the next chapter.
