# Chapter 78: On the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month, Ascending the Heights; Dog's Eyes Avoid the Pestilence; The Ghost King Enters the Pit, The Scholar Suffers Deceit

Now it happened that Huan Jing was treacherously assailed by a host of ghosts; but fortunately, through the timely words of Fei Changfang, who awakened him to the danger, his whole household took refuge on a mountain top, and thus escaped great calamity. Returning home, he found that all his domestic animals — oxen, sheep, chickens, and dogs — were wholly dead. Examining their bodies, he saw that all were stricken by pestilence, and so he understood that Fei Changfang’s counsel to flee was based upon foresight of the harm wrought by the pestilential ghosts. His heart was full of both gratitude and resentment — gratitude for Changfang’s affection in saving his family’s lives; resentment against the cruel demons who had dealt such poison. While directing his servants to collect all the remains of the animals, suddenly a report came that Fei Changfang himself had been harmed by wicked ghosts and had died in a deep ravine. Huan Jing was greatly startled, and hastened to mount a swift horse and ride to Fei’s house.

Upon arriving at the gate, he heard within a wailing that shook the heavens. His heart leapt uneasily. He dismounted, tied his horse to a tree, and was in the act of drawing the reins when he saw that on both sides of Fei’s gate stood countless grim and fearful demons, whispering together as if in consultation; yet each face bore a joyous expression. Huan Jing, who was able to see ghosts but not to hear their speech, had lately become frequent in his dealings with Fei Changfang, and had learned by some method to understand ghostly speech. Though not as clear and distinct as Fei himself, he could roughly grasp their meaning. Now, having both sight and sound, he could not but be filled with dread and trembling. It happened to be the Double Ninth Festival, and the north wind had just begun to blow, sharp and piercing, carrying many ghostly words into his ears, which he understood fully.

It appeared that after Fei Changfang had informed Huan Jing and advised him to take refuge, he returned home and repeated the matter to his family. Among them was his fifth-generation grandson, named Jinghou, who was over sixty years old, and who reproached him for meddling too much in others’ affairs. He said: ‘I take it that those who are tormented by ghosts must have some reason. As for those who are upright, luminous, well governed, and benevolent, not only can ghosts not approach them, but even gods, Buddhas, and immortals will respect them to some degree. Such men are to be found in the world nowadays. If such good men exist, and ghosts dare not violate them, then there is no need to help save Huan Jing. Therefore, those whom he rescues must be wicked persons who deserve ghostly invasion. Whether it is right to save Huan Jing is itself doubtful. Those ghosts are clever and cunning. If Huan Jing were a person not to be slain, would they dare to risk themselves to oppose him? Thus, whether Huan Jing should be saved is a question. Our ancestor acts out of pity; but as a master of ghosts, he is the leader of ten thousand spirits. When ghosts commit unlawful acts, he should punish them; if not, should he show them favour and thus display the way of benevolence and severity, so that all ghosts might hear and be impressed? Then his work would be easier. If he relies on magic to aid friends and oppress ghosts, even if just, their hearts will not be pleased. What is more, it may not be altogether just. Ancestor, think well — if this matter is done, is there no danger?’

Changfang, hearing this, became greatly remorseful; but his nature was strong and ambitious, and having done the deed, he would not allow the matter to be discussed further. Little did he know that when the ghosts heard that Changfang had frustrated their plans, they were indeed enraged, and called a new assembly. The spiteful ghosts, the clever ghosts, and others declared: ‘Changfang’s conduct is not only without any feeling towards us in the ghostly realm, but now that Huan Jing knows of it, his hatred will increase. In the days to come, he will strive more and more to frustrate our actions. Would that not be self-defeating? Moreover, Fei is our master of ghosts and our leader. If any of us are unworthy, he punishes them; if any are wronged, he clears their names and avenges them. Only so can we respect and honour his sincere intentions; only so is he worthy to be our master. But now he has turned into a public enemy of the ghosts, his hatred even greater than Huan Jing’s. What use is such a leader? Better seize this opportunity to catch his fault and deal with him. Since he rescued our enemy, let him die in his place. This will warn future masters of ghosts, and frighten that Huan Jing not to oppose us again. When he has died and become a ghost, we will contest with him in the underworld. The King of Hell is known for justice, and cannot be partial. Besides, we ghosts, united as one, if guilty, will all be punished; the King of Hell cannot destroy us all. As for this matter, it is Changfang who is at fault. How can the King of Hell allow him such reckless action? Surely in the Court of Retribution he will be charged with some small crime.’

The ghosts, after hearing this, were at first angry, then all agreed to their plan. Changfang had held the office of master of ghosts for several centuries without mishap, and was trusted and esteemed, with no fear of accident. Even so, this matter was grave in the eyes of the ghosts; but he regarded it as a small fault, thinking that in the future an apology would suffice for peace. He never dreamed that malice against man was worse than snake or scorpion, and that among ghosts it was all the more cruel. It amazed him to no end that these petty ghosts would dare rebel against him. Their method was this: though Changfang subdued ghosts with his own magical power, he could not dispense with the talisman taught by Wang Yi, which he carried always; at bedtime he hid it in his hair, never leaving it for an instant. Once he parted from it, his eyes became as if veiled by a heavy curtain, unable to see ghosts. His magic then lost efficacy. Usually, the ghosts, obeying Changfang, did not seek to vex him; and he was careless, taking no precautions. Now that they sought to trouble him, their first step was naturally to steal his talisman. But this talisman was very powerful; any ghost approaching it would lose soul and senses, like a wisp of blue smoke that could not gather, and so the spirit would perish. Therefore, though they spoke thus, when it came to asking who should undertake this theft, the ghosts looked at one another and hesitated long; none dared to accept so perilous a task.

Just in their difficulty, suddenly came a reckless ghost, distraught and lost, whose soul was almost gone. As one bereft of soul, he could hardly be called a ghost; but because of unavenged grievances, a certain ghostly substance had formed in him. Arriving at the meeting-place, he saluted the old ghosts. The others, in sorrow and helplessness, paid him no mind, for such visits were common. But when the clever ghosts saw him, they rejoiced, hastening to greet him. They signalled to the spiteful and wise ghosts, a group of seniors well learned, to come and show respect. The new ghost, surprised by such honour, was grateful, and asked the purpose of the meeting. The spiteful ghosts sighed, and told him of the matter, but concealed the power of the talisman, adding that Changfang’s possession of it was for punishing new ghosts, and that it was very formidable and to be feared.

The new ghost was afraid, and asked if there was a way to resist. The clever ghosts said: ‘We ghosts, new or old, treat all alike. Today, because many new brothers fear the talisman’s power, and cannot bear the hardship, they have asked us old ghosts to devise a plan. To help the new ghosts, the first step is to find a reckless, lost ghost to steal the talisman. The second step, we ourselves will go to his chamber, and with cow-dung and mud plug up his five orifices and seven apertures, suffocating him to death. The third step is all of us to accompany him to the Court of Retribution, to see whether the King of Hell will uphold justice and punish him for misuse of power and oppression of new ghosts, or whether he will show partiality. Then we will have further means to deal with him. Though the plan is agreed, we have not yet found such a reckless ghost, so the discussion continues.’

The new ghost, who was indeed reckless and foolhardy, eager for action and meddlesome, at once volunteered, saying: ‘I am new here, and have not yet achieved anything. Since the elders cannot find such a ghost, and I belong to this kind, perhaps I may be employed.’ The ghosts, seeing his spirit, quickly changed their disdain for the new ghost into favour. Each displayed ghostly wit and cunning, vying to flatter him, offering ghostly words and plans, weaving many schemes and endless talk. Together they made a great ghostly plot.

At last, the spiteful ghosts gave orders, sending that new ghost to steal the talisman. Four clever ghosts and eight brutal ghosts were appointed to bring dung and filth, ready to execute the second step as soon as the talisman was taken. Two subtle ghosts were assigned as support. In gloomy wind and grim ghostly air, the host of ghosts hastened to Fei’s house. These old ghosts were familiar with the place, and led the new ghost to Fei Changfang’s chamber. It was just the fourth watch of the night; Changfang was sleeping soundly, without even dreaming. The reckless ghost, true to his nature, thought no more of consequences, but stepped forward and searched among Changfang’s hair, finding a small piece of paper, hastily pulling it out. Truly, one without soul has no soul to lose. He took the talisman and went off proudly to report his deed.

Meanwhile, the ghosts, seeing Changfang lost his talisman, grew bolder, and began to seal all the orifices of his body tightly, leaving no air. Such punishment, if done by the living, would provoke resistance; but by ghosts, it took no time nor struggle, and Changfang soon died, and with a host of ghosts went to the Court of Retribution to plead his case. Such was the manner of Fei Changfang’s death at the hands of ghosts.

Huan Jing, having heard all, was chilled with fear, and hastened to pay respects. Returning home, his heart overthrown with shock, he soon followed his old friend Fei Changfang to the underworld. This benefited the King of Hell, who could combine several cases for trial, and thus simplify procedure. These are matters of the nether world; this book is not a history of the underworld, nor a record of its judgments. The outcome of this complex case must be passed over briefly.

But here are two things for the reader’s notice: First, that Huan Jing, because he possessed the Dog Pellet, could see ghosts; hence the modern term ‘Dog’s Eyes’ for those who can see ghosts. This phrase originates thus. In truth, Huan Jing’s ghost-seeing depended on the Dog Pellet, which gave him a special eyesight, deserving the name ‘Dog’s Eyes.’ Today’s so-called ‘Dog’s Eyes’ do not necessarily have the Dog Pellet. Some wise men say they only use the name to gather money, not truly to see ghosts. The author holds that even if they truly see ghosts, it is only a physiological peculiarity, not quite corresponding with the name. But customs endure; the name is fixed, and the author cannot defend them. Second, the ninth day of the ninth month is called the Double Yang Festival; today many ascend heights then. This is but a survival of Huan Jing’s story of fleeing ghosts by climbing mountains. It is unknown what enmity people now bear against ghosts that they imitate this. That a matter so baseless should be handed down for over two thousand years, unchanged and unquestioned, is both laughable and strange. The author does not oppose climbing heights, nor deny that the ninth day should be so observed. Climbing heights refreshes the mind and benefits the body, and may be done at any time, not only on the Double Ninth. Indeed, one need not stay home that day to oppose the custom. Whether to climb or not, on the Double Ninth or another day, so long as climbing is not regarded as fleeing danger, all is reasonable and no blind imitation results.

Leaving these matters, after Fei Changfang’s death, another named Hu Ziyu succeeded him. After Ziyu’s death, two more passed the office onward, until in the Tang dynasty the scholar Zhong Kui took the post at Zhongnan Mountain. Zhong Kui, though a man of letters, was tall and mighty, strong as a tiger. Failing to advance in rank, he retired into seclusion. Because of his uprightness, he was given the charge of governing ghosts. Yet he had a peculiar nature, quick-tempered and fiery, often venting anger on spirits. He possessed a certain magic treasure greatly feared by ghosts — a willow branch. By chanting a spell thrice upon the willow, and breaking off a branch to strike a ghost, no one else could see the ghost, but a mournful wail could be heard. After whipping, bloodstains appeared on the ground. Hence it is said willow branches scare ghosts. In the countryside, when a sick person goes to a doctor, it is customary to take some willow twigs, place them on the person or in the vehicle, believing such things drive away spirits. Yet Zhong Kui’s power lay chiefly in his incantations; with the spell, any branch or fruit of peach or plum would serve. To use just the willow without the spell is to lose the root and follow the branch — an act of supreme folly. This, too, is a popular error, a joke passed down, like the Double Ninth climbing and Dog’s Eyes ghost-seeing — forms of superstition which need not be further dwelt upon.

Now as for Zhong Kui, who governed by force, how could ghosts endure? Some brave and wise ghost proposed resistance to him. The host, long suffering his punishments and seeking to break his yoke, naturally agreed. Their plan was excellent. Zhong Kui was afflicted with eye disease, and always wore large spectacles when going out, only thus able to find his way. Without these, he was nearly blind. The ghosts took advantage of this. When he went out, they sent two taller wraiths behind him; taking him unawares, they struck his spectacles from his face. Zhong Kui, losing his glasses, looked back, but the wraiths, being invisible, had vanished without trace. He became irritable and ran about wildly, heedless, while many small ghosts lay in wait, throwing stones to trip him. Thus Zhong Kui fell half dead, dirty and dishevelled, like a muddy sow. Finally, some strong ghosts pushed him into a cesspool, deep and filthy, whence he could not walk or climb out. The more he raged, the more trapped he was, and he made a great noise until midnight, when some came to his relief, hearing him calling, and rescued him. This is the worldly farce in which Zhong Kui was bewitched by ghosts.

Since this loss, Zhong Kui fell ill at home. Knowing it was a ghostly revenge plot, yet grieving that as master of ghosts he was oppressed by those under him, losing face and authority, he no longer wished to govern ghosts. In anger and shame, he soon died. Since then, none dared lightly accept the office. Yet Zhong Kui’s fame endured; all knew he could govern ghosts, and were wont to hang his image before the festivals — such is the meaning of the Ghost King.

Who succeeded Zhong Kui will be told in the next chapter.
