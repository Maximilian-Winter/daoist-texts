# Chapter 82: The Rod and Shout Awaken from the Labyrinth, The Lofty Discourse Overturns the True Immortal

Now it happened that Lü Dongbin stood with difficulty in solemn and upright posture, respectfully awaiting Zhongli Quan to awaken from his deep sleep. Suddenly he heard him utter a phrase that started his heart with terror: "If I go down now, my life will be no more." Dongbin, keen of wit beyond measure, heard these words as if cold water were poured upon his back, a rod striking upon his brow. He hastened a step forward, and in a low voice said, "Master, your disciple is here. Your disciple has long awaited to serve you." Zhongli Quan rolled himself upright, rubbing his eyes, and looked abroad; he exclaimed, "How could I have slept so long? The sky is already dark."

The old steward stepped forward and said, "The venerable master was overtaken by a strong inclination to slumber; our young lord has served him for half a day, not daring even to sit for a moment. Now it is already the time of the second drum; this old servant comes specially to attend the young lord and to bid him to rest." When he thus spoke, Dongbin was exceedingly alarmed, and quickly said, "Old steward, please go and rest. Here let me attend my master. I myself will soon take my rest; there is no need to trouble you."

Zhongli Quan then smiled and said, "Today I have suffered greatly at your hands, you and your worthy father together. My body is indeed weak, and in recent years my spirit has grown much worse. See now, only ten or so cups of wine have I taken today, and yet I am so drunk. It is a hardship upon my disciple to have laboured so long; it is altogether unreasonable." Dongbin, terrified, replied, "How can your disciple bear to hear such words from the master?" Turning, he again dismissed the old steward several times. Zhongli Quan had other attendants bring water and tea to serve him. He ordered them, "My stomach is uneasy; I require nothing but sleep. All should go to rest; there is no need to attend me." The company obeyed and withdrew.

Zhongli Quan laughed and asked Dongbin, "Why does my disciple stand thus here? For what cause have you set up a couch, that you prepare to converse with me through the long night?" Hearing this, Dongbin suddenly knelt to the ground, struck his head, and said, "Master, your disciple understands your deep intent. I know myself to be unworthy; I ought not to be covetous of wife and concubines, thus burdening my master with care; my guilt is beyond escape. Yet I trust myself to have the same aspirations and resolve as before. The desires of the world, however strong, my disciple will never be led astray by them. Pray, master, take heart; your disciple will not fail the earnest hopes or the virtuous teachings of the master. Only that the master ever pities and instructs me."

Zhongli Quan heard this and could not but sigh, saying, "In life, the fear is not in failing to know; the only calamity is in knowing falsely. Those who cannot know, when they meet with one who knows, are straightway guided and learn. But those who trust themselves to know, yet do not truly know, this is a grievous harm, and there is no chance of awakening in their whole life. You have deep roots and fine natural endowment. For all matters and principles which men deem difficult and hard to seek, you can at once explain them; this is your nature. Yet in some respects, you cannot but be overly confident. Confidence in oneself is the first gate to the Way. Without confidence, men will only yield and comply, accomplishing nothing; how then speak of cultivation? But when confidence is excessive, it tends to produce extremity and arrogance; the harm thereof is such that learning becomes mere surface and skin, and errors arise, which last a lifetime and no man dares to correct. Generally, the cleverest men are most liable to this fault. You are a man of supreme cleverness; though you fall into this error, you can awaken from it, but the loss is already not small. For example, the several words you just spoke of 'resolution' reveal a trace of excessive confidence. As I see it, your fault lies in your inability to employ this 'resolution.' You do not solve the problem, yet insist that it be 'decided,' 'determined,' 'resolved' — so many words of resolve are but proof of your excessive confidence. Moreover, you only know that your coveting of wife and concubines is your great sickness of late; unaware that besides this, your eager pursuit of rank and fame is the same calamity as lust. You know one but not the other; this fault also comes from excessive confidence. Because your confidence is so extreme, you say to yourself, 'I am certainly not such a man.' Thus no seedling of the heart will incline towards your own faults. All your acts and deeds, and all your errors, you cannot perceive. Let me tell you frankly, today I have tested you to learn whether you can, amid your errors, awaken yourself to your faults. If you were merely arrogant, and never turned back to consider, even if I slept for ten or fifteen days, you would not have stood thus anxiously and long. Then you would be, indeed, one whom wisdom deceives, becoming the world's greatest fool. But since you have some feeling and can turn inward, I see you are a man of supreme cleverness, truly wise. Though your fault is deep, it is not a fundamental disease. Therefore I judge your opportunity for repentance has come, and I must hasten to correct your former errors. If you do not turn back, alas! Time will hasten and will not spare you ten or twenty years. When your dream becomes deeper, in a twinkling half a life will have passed; then your vital essence will be exhausted, your功 and行 difficult to accomplish. Though you have the heart to enter the Way, your body and spirit will be too late to catch up with the course."

Dongbin heard this and sweat broke forth from all his body. He knelt prostrate, striking his head without cease, tears flowing, and said, "Your disciple understands; he is awakened. All that was before is as if dead yesterday. All that is henceforth only lives today. Your disciple now turns inward, perceiving that his recent words and deeds have already entered a dangerous labyrinth. If he did not think himself in danger, yet dared to boast so boldly before the master, it shows how near the peril is."

Zhongli Quan ordered him to rise and stand aside. Then with solemn countenance he said, "You often suspect me to be a Golden Immortal of Heaven; this is not untrue. Yet because I have not met the opportunity, and many worldly ties remain unresolved, I am not yet able to ascend to Heaven. Even in your matter, I must bear some responsibility. Do you know who you were in your former life? I will tell you frankly: you are none other than the Eastern Emperor, worshipped by the world at this day. And I am your disciple. Zhongli Quan are my true names; I have the style of Yunfang, and men call me Master Yunfang. For this or that reason you yet harbour a great wish, and so you received the Jade Emperor’s command to descend to the mortal realm. At descent, the Jade Emperor entrusted you with a great mission. Therefore your cultivation surpasses that of any other cultivator of the world. And because your cultivation is so worthy, your responsibility is all the greater. How then should you fix your heart and strive diligently, so as not to fail your own purpose in coming to this world, nor disappoint the Jade Emperor who sent you thither?"

Dongbin heard and was struck with sudden reverence. He bowed low and said, "Your disciple fears he has done wrong to be your disciple, to follow you about, and yet until today not know that my master is truly a Great Golden Immortal of the Great Luo, who descends to this dusty world for me alone. Your disciple also knows not the causal relations of former and present lives; nor the great responsibility he bears. The boastful words I have spoken before you, now I know that only when one attains that state is one truly diligent and responsible; then indeed my descent to the world is not in vain. Master, your disciple now has true resolve, and wishes immediately to leave home and forsake office, that he may regain his free and untrammelled self, roaming the mountains and waters, refining my sinews and bones, increasing my knowledge. After several years, perhaps some achievement may be gained. Then I will seek your instruction in the Great Way and the Golden Elixir. If I may become a true immortal early, I may sooner save the world’s people. But your disciple yet has private ties he cannot break; I pray master to explain this for me."

Zhongli Quan saw that he was easily enlightened and nodded in praise, saying, "After all, you are a man of deep roots; higher than other clever men. Your present care is concerning the inability to abandon your parents at once. You would wait to explain and then depart, but fear you may not be granted leave, and so fail in your departure. Is this so?" Dongbin said, "Master is wise, discerning my heart. My mind now is much different from that before this afternoon. Before I still had thoughts of rank, honour, wives, concubines, and children; but now, save only my aged parents, I have no other care. Not that I regard wife and children as strangers, but their years are young; grief and worry will not harm their bodies or hearts. Only my two old parents, whose bodies have long been weak and whose spirits visibly decay. If they know that their beloved son abandons home and departs, such grief may produce a grievous illness; what can be done?"

Zhongli Quan laughed and said, "Did you not say at first that to transform the world you must begin with parents and wife? How now do you first think to abandon your parents? I have long told you that the Way of Immortals is none other than human feelings. To become immortal and yet be unfilial to parents and unkind to wife is to become a man the world would shun; how can such be human?"

Dongbin, alarmed and anxious, said, "Master’s teachings, what word is not ever present in my heart? Yet today’s matters are difficult to reconcile. My cultivation is utterly insufficient; how can I move others? Is this not a deadly difficulty for me?"

Zhongli Quan laughed aloud, "Since you know yourself lacking, will you not seek help from others?" At these words Dongbin immediately knelt long on the ground, striking his head with sound, and said, "Your disciple is resolved to become a monk, and will never look back. Since master so counsels, I beseech you to undertake this matter for me." Zhongli Quan smiled and said, "Enough, those who speak of right and wrong are men of right and wrong. Since I have spoken thus, I cannot but again aid you. Our worldly friendship shall end here. Henceforth when we meet, we shall be master and disciple of the world beyond, and our relation shall no longer be as before."

Dongbin, seeing his consent, rejoiced greatly. Bowing, he arose and asked, "Your disciple resolves to depart at dawn tomorrow. Master, which path do you think I should take?" Zhongli Quan pondered silently a moment, then said, "Since you bear a great aspiration and such basis, beyond Heaven and Earth, within the world, wherever gods, immortals, and Buddhas dwell, you may go. But now you must first journey to Mount Lu. There an immortal dwells in the Jade Chamber Cave, awaiting your teaching of the Heaven-Escape Sword Method. With this sword method, beyond the five escapes, you gain the art of the sword escape; hence its name. To possess this sword is better than a hundred sharp weapons. As for the studies you should pursue these three years, I have fully instructed you these five years. You have only to practise these methods thoroughly. In half a year, you may fast on grain; in two years, you may soar on clouds and summon spirits and generals; in three years, you may have some knowledge of transformations, and understand the principles of the five elements’ generation and overcoming. An ordinary cultivator would take a hundred years to attain this; but by your nature, it may be attained within three years. When the three years are completed, you may await me on the banks of the Xiang River. Then I will together with you rescue one who is similarly fated. At that time I will bestow upon you more refined and profound knowledge."

When he had spoken, he took out a Taoist robe and personally clad him therewith, bidding, "Do not underestimate this robe. It is called the Primordial Eight Trigram Robe. Neither water nor fire can approach it; weapons cannot harm it. When cold, it warms; when hot, it summons winds. Wear it always; you shall need no other clothing. For all cultivators, their home is everywhere. Desolate mountains, ancient temples, riverbanks, all are bestowed homes from Heaven. With this robe, common demons and monsters, perceiving your aura, will be afraid and dare no longer seek you. The first duty of one who leaves the home is to endure hardship. I have planned for you, yet it seems I would not let you suffer. This is because you have your own basis, unlike those who cultivate from emptiness. If you doubt this, you may test it on your journey. If not by other things, by walking, bearing hunger, dispelling sleep demons, braving wind and frost — all the hardships of travel which you have never known in life — yet these shall not distress you, for your former deeds, your cultivation and magic, are deeper and greater than any immortal or god. In this life you have inherited a rare spirit, and need not much cultivate the small ways of refining sinews and lightening the body. Disciple, these are your greatest advantages, beyond all others. If you should stray or be negligent, how grievous and lamentable would it be!" Dongbin bowed deeply and said, "Your disciple understands; master may rest assured."

Zhongli Quan added, "There is yet a small plaything, for your convenience and to save others. It teaches the art of turning stone to silver, and iron to gold." Dongbin asked, "Master, can this gold and silver so transformed remain unchanged forever?" Zhongli Quan answered, "Perhaps for five hundred years. After five hundred years, it returns to its original form. This too is a principle of the cycles of Heaven and Earth; how could it be otherwise? If there were a way for it never to change back, it could not be made gold or silver today."

Dongbin frowned uneasily and said, "If so, your disciple will not use this method, lest it harm those who come after five hundred years." Zhongli Quan heard this and could not but nod in admiration, saying, "Rare, rare indeed! I had not thought of this. It is but a simple and obvious principle. But those who learn methods study their arts; when the method is learned, and with intent to help the poor and needy, that is already a great good, a fine heart. Who then cares for those who after five hundred years receive this gold or silver, and suffer the harm of its return to iron or stone? Not only I, but many immortals can do this, yet none have considered such matters. Who would have thought that you, a beginner, should awaken us with a single word, correcting many immortals who care only for the present and not the future? This one saying alone outweighs five hundred years of功行. Rare, rare — worthy of admiration and respect."

He then laid his hand upon his shoulder, smiling with joy, and said, "Good lad, you have such wise kindness and fine discernment; your future is beyond measure. In a thousand years, you will surely be leader among immortals. Strive, strive; do not fail your fine endowments and talents!" Dongbin, receiving praise, felt somewhat uneasy, and said, "Master’s praise is too great for your disciple. I but seek early true enlightenment, to follow your staff a few times, and admonish the world’s people; that is enough for my wish. As for my own future, how dare I entertain wild thoughts?"

Zhongli Quan nodded, "The honours, ranks, and positions of gods, Buddhas, and immortals are all fixed by fate. What Heaven ordains, men cannot overturn. What Heaven rejects, men cannot save themselves from. On your journey you will immediately be involved in a trifling matter. You cannot avoid it; if you manage it, you will suffer small slanders. Even this small matter has its law of cause and effect. Fortunately, you have protection ahead, and need not fear."

The master and disciple talked until the sky was dim with dawn. Dongbin dared not delay; he bade farewell, and prepared to depart. Zhongli Quan said, "Now the gates are many and heavy; how will you get out? Come, come, let me escort you." Taking Dongbin by the arm, he led him out of the chamber into a small courtyard. Looking up, there was faint light of stars and moon, hidden behind clouds that drifted and would not show their faces, as if ashamed to be seen. The morning wind stirred the branches and leaves of the parasol trees, making a mournful sound. On the branches, birds weary from dreams awoke, chirping and calling to one another, as if saying, "The morning light has come; all should awake and attend to their proper duties, no longer lost in the night." On the ground, the master and disciple, hand in hand, sighed softly.

Dongbin sorrowfully said, "Master, men die for wealth, birds perish for food. Men born into the world, why are they all plunged into the sea of worldly desires? See them rise early and sleep late, ever toiling for fame and profit; they themselves think this is right, the proper course of life. But to one beyond the world, what difference is there from the birds on the branches seeking food? When the time of death comes, life but a moment, can the honours and riches won by cunning and strength be carried to the nether world? And as those birds pass through spring and summer to autumn and winter, busy and idle without rest, in a moment old die in the forest nest, or fall by the hand of wayward children or hunters. What then become the fruits of all their toils? When I began my Way, I was myself in turmoil. Facing such men who only seek the present and think not of retreat, I cannot but silently grieve for them. Master, may your disciple someday relieve them somewhat?"

Zhongli Quan smiled and said, "The ancients said, 'Should one man not be saved, it is Heaven’s fault.' What a great heart is this! The Buddha so said, 'If I do not enter hell, who will enter hell?' What a compassionate heart! Shun was a man, and I am a man. What men can do and say I cannot, that is the act of cowards and slaves, which men of resolve disdain. Disciple, since you have such a good heart, ask not what you may or may not do in future; only strive now with diligence. Heaven’s Way is most just; Heaven’s heart most merciful. When men have good thoughts, Heaven surely follows. Go forth then, disciple, pursue your course, exhaust your strength. Future matters will be dealt with in future. To fret and be troubled brings only suffering and consumes your Way-heart. Farewell, Dongbin; care for yourself. Forget not the appointment on the banks of the Xiang River after three years."

When he had spoken, he raised his hand to the empty air, and suddenly a hoarse cry was heard from the ends of Heaven. Dongbin, startled, looked and saw a white crane descending from the sky, circling the woods thrice, frightening the little birds which chirped in their nests, scattering them in flight. Zhongli Quan shouted, "Wicked beast, how dare you rely on your size to bully the small, neglect your duties? Come quickly to escort your senior brother on his journey." The crane heard and instantly rolled down, alighting on the ground, transforming into a boy, with bright eyes, clear brows, red lips, and white teeth, truly lovable. Bowing to Zhongli Quan, he asked, "Master, which senior brother is this?" Zhongli Quan pointed at Dongbin and said, "This is Senior Brother Lü; he now journeys to the region of Nanchang. You shall escort him to the northern bank of the river, and let him proceed thence."

Dongbin acknowledged with a raised hand in salute. The boy returned the salute. At this moment Dongbin seemed somewhat reluctant to part, holding tightly to his master’s hand, sobbing softly. Suddenly Zhongli Quan cried out, "Since you say you cultivate the Way, how can your worldly heart be so heavy? Go quickly on your way!" As he spoke, he struck Dongbin lightly on the forehead. Dongbin was greatly startled, and hurriedly opened his eyes. Ah, truly the wondrous use of the immortals, mysterious and unfathomable. He found himself already floating and soaring beyond the Nine Heavens. How he mounted the boy’s shoulders he knew not. The boy had again become a white crane, bearing him aloft in mid-air. This frightened Dongbin so that he could not utter a sound.

What extraordinary matters befell Dongbin on his journey are to be explained in the next chapter.
