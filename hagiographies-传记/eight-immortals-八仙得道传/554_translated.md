# Chapter Eighty-Six: The Rescue of the Holy Mother by Borrowing the Glazed-Hall, and the Special Making of the Precious Lotus Lamp for the Infant

It is said, Chang’e and Lü Dongbin discoursed beneath the moonlight, speaking of He Xiangu’s inadvertent word. This stirred the wrath of Erlang Shen, who by his magic laid his own sister, Lady Yuanzhen, under the weight of Mount Tai. The goddess was deeply grieved in heart, and entreated Master Tieguai for counsel in rescue, saying: “If there be any concern or consequence, I dare not harm others; I am willing alone to bear the blame.” Dongbin inquired hastily: “How, then, do they rescue this Lady Yuanzhen?” Chang’e laughed, saying: “Are you then also foolish? Among all the great Luotian immortals, is there one who lacks skill in the art of stealing heaven and exchanging days? Not to say she is pressed under the little Mount Tai, even if confined beneath the sea, they would entreat the Dragon King. Even if the mountains of all the myriad nations were piled upon her, they have the power to move mountains into the sea. Yet Master Tieguai is unwilling to act so rashly, for the lady’s offence is real. If Erlang were to immediately rescue her by force, first, the matter would be too great, and would be as if to rescue from a well; second, it would injure Erlang’s prestige and put him to shame. Both are improper. At last he devised a method that is perfect in both respects: neither to harm Erlang’s face nor to break the heavenly laws, yet so that the lady would feel no burden of her imprisonment, as if she were peacefully seated in the temple as before.”

When these words were spoken, the assembly was filled with joy. Thereupon Tieguai led the company of immortals to the summit of Mount Tai. There was the cave-dwelling of Tieguai, where his disciple Yang Ren practiced the Tao. Tieguai and the immortals first entered the cave, and Yang Ren knelt to receive them and inquired the cause. Tieguai briefly explained, then sent Yang Ren out to summon the local earth gods of the mountain. Yang Ren obeyed, and called together more than thirty earth gods of all ranks. Tieguai instructed them: “Lady Yuanzhen has been pressed beneath the mountain by her brother Erlang for her offence. This poor Taoist pities her, for it was unintentional and can be forgiven. I specially invite you, exalted immortals, to assist in a small matter. My intent is that the heavenly law must not be broken; Erlang’s face must be preserved. Since Lady Yuanzhen has violated the heavenly code, she must temporarily endure this grievance. We only prepare to do her a friendly service, to protect her from suffering. First, to build for her a cave-dwelling beneath this mountain, a place for her to cultivate the Tao in atonement for her guilt. Second, although she cannot leave the mountain, we will visit her from time to time, and a bird-way must be opened from the cave to the mountain’s surface. Third, I beseech the venerable gods to lend their aid, to keep watch over the cave and the bird-way, to prevent collapse or closure, and to attend to her needs whenever they arise. Should the lady have any demand or message, she may communicate with the disciple Yang Ren within this cave. Is this a service to which you can assent?”

The earth gods heard and unanimously agreed, saying: “We obey your command.” Tieguai comforted them and led the immortals to visit the lady. Arriving at the mountain’s foot, Tieguai employed his great art to move half of Mount Tai away by a league. They descended to the base, and saw the lady with dishevelled hair and sullied face, clad in the garb of a criminal, curled up and lying as if dead on the ground. Among the immortals, He Xiangu was the only woman, and her heart was most compassionate. Especially knowing that this matter arose from herself, her grief was unspeakable. She went forward first, weeping and calling, and lifted the lady up.

The lady, seeing the immortals, was both sorrowful and ashamed, thinking it a dream to meet again. After the goddess explained their purpose and confessed herself the cause of the trouble, with deep remorse, the lady sighed: “All this is destiny. Your humble sister has violated the heavenly law and harboured guile. Such matters, in the end, must be revealed, what concern is it of my elder sister? Now, having your invitation, and that of the elder teachers and brothers who have come from afar to help, your humble sister is truly grateful beyond words. Should disaster be averted and guilt removed, and she see the sun again, the great kindnesses of elder sister and all are debts that cannot be repaid in many lifetimes.”

The immortals were moved to tears. Tieguai then employed his wondrous arts to journey in spirit to the sea palace, borrowing from the Crystal Palace a row of five or six glazed houses. In each hung a bright pearl, shining brighter than daylight. Moreover, there were also two pearls for dispelling heat and avoiding cold, which he entrusted to the lady. To be thus provided for in a prison was far more delicate than the temple lodging; the lady’s heart was greatly gladdened. Then the immortals brought furnishings and utensils, completing the chambers so perfectly that it seemed not a fairy abode but the dwelling of wealthy mortals. The lady smiled and said: “Such kindness is beyond words of thanks. Yet to dwell so long in comfort, I fear that after my guilt is removed, I may be loath to depart.” These words caused the immortals to laugh heartily.

Tieguai nodded, and said: “The cultivator should see through all joys and sorrows, and be free from worldly entanglement. Now two matters remain to explain to the lady. First, we have agreed that, no matter when she may leave the mountain, among these ten or so immortals, one will be sent every year to this place to teach her some Taoist arts. Though she is beneath the earth, she may concentrate on her practice. After the disaster is removed, she may ascend to the heavenly kingdom and accomplish greater affairs for the Celestial House. This is most important.” The lady, hearing this, was deeply moved and kowtowed with sound. He Xiangu hastened to support her. Tieguai continued: “Second, the lady will shortly bear a son. This child shall be provided with the essence of mountains and rivers and the light of the morning sun by the great goddess He Xiangu, who shall make a lamp called the Precious Lotus Lamp. After birth, you shall place the child and the lamp in a chamber to the east; the earth gods will see to their delivery, and the child will be given to your husband Wang Chang. This lamp is no mortal fire; wherever its light reaches, all demons and evil spirits flee ten li away, and it is spiritually sensitive to guide the lost. For example, if we wish to go anywhere, we need not ask others, but simply follow the direction of the flame, and we shall not err.”

Here He Xiangu interposed: “Leave this matter to me; I will not err.” Then an elder earth god came forth and said: “When the lady gives birth to her son, I shall personally undertake the protection. It cannot be entrusted to a band of ghostly servants, lest the lady worry.” Tieguai, knowing him to be the earth god within fifty li, bowed and said: “Your honour’s labour is a true comfort to the lady.” The lady also hastened to bow thanks to He Xiangu and the earth gods.

Lan Caihe, seeing that he could do no better, laughed and said: “I will seek some persons for the lady.” The immortals approved, saying: “That indeed is an important matter. You have thought it through.” Caihe invited the chief earth god of Mount Tai to the summit and asked: “Are there any female demons nearby?” The earth god replied: “How could there be none? One hundred li hence is a white rabbit spirit who gathers many solitary rabbits, troubling the mortal realm. Great Immortal, do you wish to detain some of them to serve Lady Yuanzhen?” Caihe nodded assent. The earth god said: “That is well, but I fear these wild spirits will be unruly and a burden to the lady. What shall be done?” Caihe laughed: “I have my methods to keep them from mischief. Moreover, the lady has cultivated Tao for many years; the demons, seeing her, will only strive to flatter her, hoping to attain true fruit in time, and dare not be obstinate.”

The earth god led him by earth-dissolution to the place described. By chance, the rabbit spirit was in a clearing, playing with many female demons. They saw Caihe’s magnificent bearing and took him to be extraordinary. The leading rabbit spirit, harbouring an ambition, said something to the demons, coquettishly smiled, and approached Caihe with a greeting: “Whence comes the Taoist?” Seeing an old man behind him, whom they recognized as the chief earth god of the mountain, she laughed: “Why does this old man follow? A rare guest indeed.” Caihe smiled: “No one comes without cause. I am the Taoist Lan Caihe, come to invite you sisters to a suitable place to serve a heavenly immortal in distress. In time you shall have good fortune and a good fruit. Who is willing to go? If not, I have boasted on the other side and shall drag you along.” 

The rabbit spirit laughed and said: “You are handsome and clever, but really a foolish man. We are free and untrammelled; who would serve another as a subordinate? Even if you force us, it is like a dragonfly shaking a stone pillar; we will not move. Better you be our mountain master, and we five sisters your wives, living a carefree life. Why help these unlucky women?” Turning to Caihe, she coquettishly winked, casting a hundred charms. If a mortal saw this, he would lose his soul and fall into enchantment. But meeting this one whose Taoist heart was pure, it was all in vain. Caihe shouted thunderously as a clap of thunder, wielding his sword and pointing at the rabbit spirit: “Do you think I am joking? Enough! I shall show you some small wonders.” He then opened his mouth and breathed forth myriad silver rays, enveloping the rabbit’s body, turning into countless blades assailing the rabbit spirit. The spirit was terrified, knelt, kowtowed, and begged for mercy, willing to follow the Immortal to serve the suffering fairy.

Caihe inhaled the silver light, drawing it instantly into his mouth, then commanded the rabbit spirit to rise and accompany him to the cave mouth. The spirit went to consult her sisters, and, surprisingly, they all agreed to go. Caihe rejoiced and stood in the midst, recounting the lady’s origin, rank, the present calamity, and the help of the immortals. At last he earnestly admonished: “You, as other beings, have cultivated to such merit; renouncing the path and assembling to mischief is like bandits in the world, who will one day be destroyed by celestial soldiers. Why not seize this chance and abandon evil to return to right? Now many golden immortals help the lady. If you serve long, when the lady returns to her place, will she forsake you? These great immortals know you; if they but assist you, you may ascend to the heavens. This is a rare opportunity. If you miss it, in ten years others will have attained true enlightenment, and you remain demons. Would that not shame you?” The demons all cried out: “We will follow the great immortal and never repent. If we waver, may we suffer the thunder calamity.”

Caihe was greatly pleased: “Rare is your resolve; you shall attain true fruit. If the lady refuses to take you, I will act for you, so that each of you becomes immortal. But one thing: we humans have ceremonies and prohibitions; better to state at the outset: if you would go, each stretch forth the hand to receive a talisman from me. Should you change heart or commit misdeeds, a mere raising of the hand will send forth thunder and lightning to strike you dead instantly. Do not say I am harsh; the initial stage of Tao is the hardest to keep the mind in order. If the heart is afraid, this strong method must be used; with time it becomes natural. At the same time, your merit will be sufficient and the talisman will naturally fade away; no need to undo it. Do you agree?” The demons said: “We leave it to the great immortal.” As they spoke, each extended a hand, and Caihe inscribed talismans on them one by one. Then he led them, scattering lesser demons, to the underworld to meet the immortals. Caihe ordered the five demons to kowtow one by one. Seeing so many radiant immortals, they were ashamed of their own coarseness, and truly resolved to serve the lady faithfully. The immortals finished this matter, took leave of the lady, and dispersed.

But Erlang, ashamed at his sister’s disgraceful act, lacking face to meet men, sought leave from heaven and returned to his place in Guankou plain. Upon leaving, save for official affairs delegated to other gods, he left all his personal matters unsettled. Even his ever-following Howling Celestial Dog was left behind in his office, never taken along. Thus the dog found leisure to descend to the mortal realm and cause trouble.

Chang’e told this long story, then paused a moment. Dongbin then suddenly understood, saying: “I had long doubted how Erlang, so great a god, could be so lax in control that his attendant Howling Celestial Dog could descend secretly. Now, according to the fairy’s account, there is such great cause. This is no wonder. Pray, fair fairy, what is the message entrusted to you by Great Immortal Zhang? Why not entrust another, but repose it with you? Will Erlang come to claim the dog? Pray explain swiftly.”

Chang’e nodded: “Be not impatient. This is the main point. Naturally I will tell you. Lady Yuanzhen, at full term, bore a son named Wang Tai. Though confined beneath the mountain, he was more comfortable than in the temple as a god. Many earth goddesses vied to attend him, and several female demons served diligently. The birth was painless. On the third morning, He Xiangu’s Precious Lotus Lamp was delivered. The elder earth god carried the lamp and child to the capital, delivering the child to her husband Wang Chang. Wang Chang had meanwhile married the daughter of Official Niu. One night, Lady Niu dreamed the earth god bringing her a son. Awaking, she told her husband the dream. Before dawn, they heard the child’s crying from the roof, and sent someone to find a fair child and a small flower lantern, along with a letter. In truth, when Wang Chang and Lady Niu betrothed, he had spoken of this, but she thought it a jest. Upon reading the letter, they knew it was true. The letter explained the origin of the Precious Lotus Lamp, and charged Wang Chang to keep the lamp constantly on the child, to avoid all disasters, and that the lamp would guide the child to find the mother.”

The couple, knowing the child to be divine, cherished him greatly. Wang Chang grieved sorely for his wife’s plight, and wept until he fell ill. Later, someone said the lamp could also cure disease; so he hung it above his sickbed. As foretold, his illness was cured and his spirit restored. Since then, the family used the lamp to heal the sick, who recovered instantly. Lady Niu’s mother, over eighty and suffering asthma and heart pain, was cured by the lamp. Thus the family cherished the lamp as treasure, and loved the child all the more. This was recent news. Because He Xiangu felt guilt for the lady, she swore before her to bear full responsibility for mother and child, and often journeyed between the capital and Mount Tai to report on the child. It was reckoned by Master Tieguai that Erlang would never allow his sister freedom of the mountain; fierce conflicts yet awaited. The immortals and Erlang, being friends in the Tao, could not speak openly. Only when the child grew could they teach and support him, so that his power would surpass Erlang’s, and he might act for his mother, defeat his maternal uncle, and welcome her out of the mountain to resume office. Such affairs were now managed solely by He Xiangu, who was busily occupied. But this concerned you not. As for your case, it also began thus. When the immortals heard Erlang ashamedly return to Shu without settling any private matters, they grieved for him and sought a way to restore his dignity. They thought: ‘The one who tied the bell should untie it.’ They said: ‘Marriage is the affair of the Matchmaker God. Since he can arrange the marriage of Wang Chang and the lady, it shows their union is not casual. The lady’s fault lies only in fearing her brother and keeping secret, which became the crime of marrying without telling. But fundamentally, it arose from respect for her brother.’ Thus they lessened the lady’s guilt and restored Erlang’s face. But without the Matchmaker God’s testimony, how could Erlang believe it? This old man was under the control of the Moon Star Lord. Now, as the Star Lord governs marriage, though it concerns morals, he despises the worldly, and good matches are rare, evil marriages many. Outside of marriage there are weeds, wild dews, the casting of peaches and fruits, and other lewd histories, all under the Star Lord’s jurisdiction. His purity could hardly endure such. Therefore, at the time of appointing many female stars, he himself moved to the outer chief star, yet left the Matchmaker God’s domain on earth, assigning it to the moon.

Chang’e spoke these words, and Dongbin unwittingly said: “What of that destitute Houyi? Is he still in his place?” Chang’e hearing this suspected mockery, cheeks flushed with anger, her face losing its spring, and for a long while made no sound. Dongbin, feeling his blunder, tried to divert the talk but could find no word, his face crimson and utterance broken.

Whether the two fell into dispute is unknown; we await the next chapter for further development.
