# Chapter 87: The Matchmaker Acts as Peacemaker; Erlang Receives the Howling Celestial Dog

Now it is recounted that though Chang’e had undergone two calamities, she had at length attained the immortal body. Yet as to the matter of Hou Yi, her heart still harboured shame and remorse. When she now heard Dongbin inquire concerning Hou Yi, at first she would make a jest, concealing a certain irritation; but upon seeing Dongbin’s anxious countenance, she readily understood and perceived that he did not intend to rake over old grievances, and thus she answered freely and fully: 'As to this man, the Star Lord originally wished to remove him to another sphere. But alas, this man and the Sahā tree have become united as one; it is as though this tree was made for him, and he cannot depart from it. If he were to be removed elsewhere, it would be necessary to transplant the tree with him. This matter is too troublesome, and so it has been deferred for discussion. Therefore Hou Yi remains still in his original place. Yet since the Star Lord has this thought, it will surely be carried out in time.'

Dongbin, hearing this, felt his heart relieved. He further asked, 'Since the Matchmaker dwells with the immortal maidens, is it possible that he might go to Guankou and explain this matter to Erlang?' Chang’e replied, 'Now on this very account, the Great Immortal Zhang Guo has entrusted me to negotiate with the Matchmaker, earnestly requesting him to come to Guankou. This is an obligation the Matchmaker cannot refuse. I must first attend to this matter upon returning, and at the same time entrust the Matchmaker to carry a message to Erlang, informing him concerning the Howling Celestial Dog. One, this will help you out of your predicament; two, it is also a mode of persuasion by which the Matchmaker urges Erlang to resume his duties. For once he departs, even the Howling Celestial Dog at his side will secretly descend to the mortal world. Much more so, there are other matters that will be affected by his absence, of which no one knows how many. He cannot, on account of personal anger, abandon many public affairs, and even harm innocent good men, such as the family of Master Wang Yuanwai, who are among them. Erlang is a man most willing to take responsibility, and least willing to harm others. With this said, it will certainly compel him to return from leave and attend to his office. Meanwhile your pressing situation will also be relieved; is this not a matter of killing two birds with one stone?'

Dongbin rejoiced greatly and bowed, saying, 'Were it not for the immortal maiden’s such care, my disciples would indeed be trapped in a close siege, helpless to devise an escape. But I know not when I shall come to Mount Lu to receive the sword techniques; I hope it does not cause the Great Immortal He and the others to grow impatient.' Chang’e returned his bow with a smile and answered, 'This is the common concern of the multitude. According to Great Immortal Zhang, the wayfarer’s origin is truly extraordinary. Not only do we fall short, but even among the Great Luo Heaven immortals there are few who equal him. Though the wayfarer is still seeking the Dao, wherever he goes there are immortals watching over and protecting him. Great Immortal Zhang is but doing his personal duty, and mostly it is also on behalf of Lady Yuanzhen. Because Lady He misspoke and drove away Erlang Shen, he is still a distinguished guest in the temple. Now all secretly protect the lady; naturally he must also contribute his efforts, thereby showing the brotherhood of the way!'

Having spoken thus, Chang’e smiled sweetly and bade farewell. In a moment the coloured clouds again appeared before them; Chang’e took a step and slowly ascended. In a moment she was raised to the mid-heaven, still waving farewell. Dongbin accompanied her until she was gone, then settled his mind and took up residence at the Wang household. Three days passed unnoticed; seeing the canine spirit did not come, and Erlang also was not seen, and having no news from anywhere, he became utterly perplexed.

That night, after completing his devotions and about to lie down to rest, suddenly there was a rustling sound at the window. He was moved in his heart and looked out. There he saw a monk’s head, through a thin paper window, peering and peeping outside. For a mortal man, this would have been barely distinguishable, at most a dark shape; but Dongbin’s eyes were unlike others’, able to see the minutest things and to look far away. Even through the paper, at more than ten paces, he could see clearly. But his nature was honest and sincere, never suspecting evil in men nor guarding against mischief. Seeing nothing amiss, he extinguished the lamp and went to sleep. Yet, after a short time, the window sounded again. This time it was different; after the rustling came a scraping noise. Dongbin greatly suspected, 'Could it be that the dog slave has again transformed into a monk, coming to seek trouble?' Though thinking so, he did not rise. Looking through the curtain, he saw a strong monk stretching out one hand and gouging a large hole in the solid wall, as if scooping dust and ashes. The monk then crawled through the hole. Dongbin now saw clearly that it was the same Zhi Yuan monk who had come that day to capture demons. Considering his stealth, he could not but suspect him of some ill intent. So he got out of bed, lit an oil lamp, and met Zhi Yuan openly.

Zhi Yuan, seeing Dongbin, said nothing at first, but surveyed the Daoist robe he wore and then asked, 'Brother Lü, may I presumptuously ask a question? Is the robe you wear the very same one you wore that day?' Dongbin laughed, 'My disciples are so poor, where could there be a second robe?' Zhi Yuan examined it further, holding a light to it, then said joyfully, 'Yes, it is indeed the same colour. Before, in the dark, I thought it differed. Now seeing it clearly, it is the same. I have a small matter to discuss with you; might you consent?'

By now Dongbin guessed much of the meaning and smiled, 'If it harms me not, and benefits the monk, there is nothing I would refuse.' Zhi Yuan smiled, 'I cannot say it harms you, but the loss will not be great. To say plainly, even if you must lose it, you cannot refuse. I will speak frankly. Since the day we parted, I have never ceased thinking of your robe...' Half-spoken, Dongbin hastened, 'I thank your concern and am deeply grateful.'

Zhi Yuan was first stunned, then, considering his words, spat and said, 'Slowly, slowly! Our acquaintance is but casual; where is the concern you speak of? I am concerned for your robe!' Dongbin now understood the monk’s purpose, and smiled, 'This too may be called a kind of concern, for the robe is my own garment. I am grateful that the monk is concerned for it.' Zhi Yuan smiled, 'You are too polite. We monks speak only of truth, not empty words. Let me tell you plainly: since that day, I have been thinking of your robe. Though it is now worn by you, it suits my uses deeply. Therefore I have waited these several days, intending to take it from you when you lay down to sleep, and keep it for you. Would not that be convenient? But you Daoists are so mean, forgive me for saying so, truly ungenerous and lacking in friendship. A mere robe, what value is it? You wear it all day and night, from getting up in the morning until sleep and dreams, even during your calls of nature, never letting it leave you. We monks all know that we rely on the Bodhisattvas for our livelihood, yet none of us cling to the Bodhisattvas so closely. Yet you poor Daoists value this robe more than we monks value the Bodhisattvas. It is a wonder I have waited six or seven days, sometimes hiding on the roof, sometimes by the wall, and once even watching all night atop your canopy. If you doubt me, I have several proofs to show you. On the day I sat by the wall, did not Master Wang send fruit to you? You ate an apricot and shared the rest with your servants; is this so? On the day I sat on your canopy, you spoke in the courtyard with a woman about many things seen and unseen—about Erlang Shen, Iron Crutch Li, and also about the Lady and the Earth God, at great length and with much excitement. Brother Lü, tell me, who is this woman? How did she enter, for I saw no one pass the door? Nor did I see you invite her to sit. How then did she leave? I saw not a trace. Could she be as skillful as I, flying over eaves and climbing walls? Or perhaps your cultivation of the Dao has produced demons and spirits to play tricks on you? Brother Lü, I truly worry for you.'

Dongbin, hearing these ill-mannered and biting words, found them both amusing and vexing, and laughed in reply, 'You have indeed bestowed great kindness. I would gladly tell you this woman’s surname and origin, but you, being a monk, do not even know how to reverence the Bodhisattvas, who are your providers of food and clothing, and you look on the Bodhisattvas less than on a Daoist’s robe. As for unrelated immortals, do you know respect for them? Were I to tell you, and suffer your ridicule, better I say nothing. You must know the arts of the immortals are vast; it is not that I fear your mockery, but that I dread adding to your faults and deepening your sins. I, poor Daoist, cannot bear it. So I must beg your pardon and refuse to disclose.'

Zhi Yuan, hearing this, was not angry, but smiled fully, saying, 'All this is empty talk and useless. I will speak plainly: since then I have recognized your niggardly nature. No matter what, do not think to take off this robe. Perhaps you have no other possessions, only this robe, so you cannot take it off; or perhaps you have not even an undergarment, making it impossible. In any case, this robe you will not remove.'

Dongbin laughed heartily, 'You draw a perfect picture of my poverty, as if you had witnessed it yourself. Fortunately, a gentleman remains a gentleman in poverty; what harm is poverty? So long as one’s vision is broad and one’s spirit large, and one does not covet others’ goods or steal, even if one has no robe at all, it matters not. Yet there are shameless men who cannot endure a rare object coming into their sight, and strive by all means to obtain it, even by theft. Such men, though rich as kings, have vile conduct and lose their humanity. What use is such wealth?'

Zhi Yuan laughed in turn, 'You are sharp-tongued. Know that at our stage, praise and blame are of no use; only practical benefit is considered. Say what you will, I do as I please. When I returned to the temple, after much thought, I conceived a good plan in two stages: the first, a gentle approach, as now between us. I again bow, and say: "Brother Lü, pardon me, may I have the honour of your robe? I have a hundred taels of silver, enough to make ten or twenty similar robes, which surely is not a great loss to you." If you consent at once, we may become lifelong friends beyond the world, calling each other brothers and maintaining lasting fellowship. What a happy thing this would be!'

Dongbin nodded, smiling, 'And the second stage?'

Zhi Yuan was silent, then produced a large black bead and gazed about the room. Suddenly he saw four paper balls, children’s toys, of varying sizes beneath the wall. He took them in hand, arranged them in a row, and blew on them one by one towards the wall, making a hole in it through which all four balls passed. Dongbin was greatly amazed, thinking: 'This is real skill, not the false arts of demons. Though my robe protects against blades, fire, and water, I know not whether it can resist such skill.' As he pondered, Zhi Yuan suddenly turned his face with a grim smile and coughed, spitting on the floor. The spit made a hole in the floor. The saliva slowly spread along the edge and trickled down.

Though Dongbin had received years of training in the arts of immortality, and understood many mysteries, he had never seen such martial skill. He grew more alarmed, yet showed no weakness. Before Zhi Yuan spoke again, Dongbin calmly laughed, 'I did not expect you to have such skill. Perhaps you learned it as a child of three or five years? A pity you entered the Buddhist order, wasting your fine abilities. You must know that Buddhist law is boundless; no matter your skill, it would be reduced to ashes by a smile or a finger snap. If you had not entered the order, but merely competed with mortals, ha! Not to flatter you to your face, there might be no invincible in the world, but it would not be easy to find so many as seventy or eighty such as you. But this is not my concern. Having seen your two demonstrations, it is but a glimpse of the hard arts spoken of in heaven. If I fail to appreciate my good fortune and refuse to give up my robe, you might then apply your wall and floor skills to my flesh and blood. But consider: I began my monastic path with no skill at all, whereas your true mastery is so formidable. Compared together, it is like an egg against a stone. I know I am innocent, and the result of resisting will still be to give up the robe. Why then make this fuss? Better to behave honestly and comply with your gentle means, quickly take off the robe, and with both hands present it, receiving your hundred taels of silver, which is much better. But alas, this robe is not man-made, nor my own. It was bestowed by my master Yunfang, to protect against blades, fire, and water. Therefore, since setting out, I have never dared to remove it for a moment. Because it has these benefits, I suppose this is why you love it. And because of this reason I dare not lightly give it away. Yet you have come sincerely and laboured many days, risking being a thief for this poor robe. You might well be its only true friend. Though I am its owner, I do not know its full power. My master says it protects against blades, fire, and water, but whether it can resist paper balls in your hand, or saliva from your mouth, I do not know. Thus I am deeply fearful, and ashamed that I am not its true friend. Now I propose a peaceful solution: you need not resort to paper balls or saliva; but please exert all your skill to damage this robe as much as you can. If, by your skill, it is immediately broken, then this tattered robe will be useless to me, and you, with dignity, will no longer need it. Thus the problem is solved. Conversely, if you, so skilled and valiant, cannot damage the robe, then I need not possess such skill. Relying only on this robe, I can overcome you. Though you had thousands of hands to hurl thousands of iron balls, and hundreds of mouths to spit countless spits, you would still be mocked by this robe. How then could you wear it? So, see, is not this a fair and proper plan?'

Zhi Yuan, hearing this, made no reply but drew his sword and thrust at Dongbin. Without weapons, Dongbin used his robe as armour, dodging and parrying. But Zhi Yuan feared to harm the robe, and only struck where the robe did not cover. Dongbin was nimble, evading when he could; when not, using the robe to shield. After several exchanges, suddenly there was a clang; Zhi Yuan’s sword struck the robe’s sleeve, sparks flew, and the blade broke. Zhi Yuan was greatly startled, but loved the robe all the more, gnashing his teeth and swearing, 'I will first blind your eyes, then see how you will dodge!' Saying this, he drew a dagger from his pouch and aimed at Dongbin’s eyes. Dongbin, fearing this move most of all, saw a gleam rushing towards his eyes. Hastily trying to avoid, it was too late. With a cry, he fell backward. Zhi Yuan rejoiced and advanced to strip the robe. But Dongbin was agile; as Zhi Yuan approached, he leaped aside, circled behind two square tables, and escaped towards the door. Dongbin conceived a plan, pushed one table down to block Zhi Yuan’s path, and thus escaped. Zhi Yuan, enraged, kicked the table with such force as to shatter it, splintering the top and legs in all directions, also smashing a powdery wall. Then he pursued.

The uproar roused the entire Wang household, who came out with lanterns and torches. Master Wang, seeing a monk and a Daoist locked in fierce combat, shouted, 'Masters, please speak calmly. What is the matter? Let us discuss it together. There is nothing that cannot be made clear. Please do not fight.' But the two were engrossed in battle and heeded not. Dongbin, relying on his robe as protection, found no way to flee. Fortunately, Zhi Yuan’s dagger injured only the sleeve, and he could strike only bare hands and feet. Sometimes his blows missed and struck the robe, which was as if against thick steel. Though trained to endure pain, flesh and blood cannot resist steel; after several blows, he was somewhat worn down. Dongbin was now at his wit’s end, unable to hold out. At the critical moment, suddenly a dog barked in the air. Master Wang and his wife were so frightened they crouched to the ground, crying to the sky for help, fearing the dog spirit had come to wreak vengeance. But Dongbin and Zhi Yuan clearly heard a voice rebuke, 'Wicked beast! You have wrought great calamity and still dare to make noise!'

The two looked up; in a flash appeared a golden-armoured god, descending from heaven with a dog. Seeing Dongbin unable to overcome Zhi Yuan, the god suddenly stretched out a foot and kicked Dongbin into midair, and he vanished in an instant. Then with a hand he seized Zhi Yuan and handed him to the dog, commanding, 'Take him to Baoguo Temple and deliver him to his master. I will follow shortly.' The dog howled fiercely and bit Zhi Yuan’s leg. Recognizing it as the Howling Celestial Dog who chased that day, Zhi Yuan knew the golden-armoured god must be Erlang Shen, the dog’s master. Terrified, his martial skill fled him. The dog bit repeatedly, blood flowed profusely, and the pain was unbearable; he cried for mercy. Erlang ordered, 'Do not bite him. Such a thief’s flesh and blood are unclean; do not soil your dog’s mouth.' The dog barked once more, then seized Zhi Yuan and leapt into the air, heading straight for Baoguo Temple.

What orders Erlang gave Master Wang, and the fate of Zhi Yuan and Dongbin, remains to be related in the next chapter.
