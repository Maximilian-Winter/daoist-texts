# Chapter 089: Subduing the Adulterous Husband and Lewd Wife at Mount Lu; Entering the Hidden Valley to Find a Blessed Cave Heaven

It is said that a whirlwind suddenly arose, enveloping a man walking by the roadside. It whirled about him several times; from a distance, this man appeared wrapped tightly in black mist, so much so that he himself seemed to have become a lump of fog. In an instant, as if his soul had fled, he was no longer master of himself, but tumbled and scrambled over, clutching the legs of Lü Dongbin, crying aloud, "Immortal Sir, redress my grievance! Immortal Sir, redress my grievance!"

Lü Dongbin, possessed of the clairvoyant eye, though it was night, could see clearly. He summoned boldness and demanded, "Who art thou, a wronged ghost? For what injustice hast thou perished? Speak first to this poor Daoist, and then we shall consider how to redress thy wrongs."

The ghost, sorrowful and plaintive, wept and told his tale: "I am the eldest son of the little ghost Zhu, named Zhu A-ming. Just now the local earth god passed on a message to me, saying: 'There is a great immortal Lü come hither. Thy grievance can only be redressed by him.' I inquired of this great immortal whether he would be willing to act for me. The earth god said: 'He has already learned of thy family affairs; it was the man Niu Da-mao on the mountain today who told him. This great immortal is most warm-hearted and most willing to aid men. He is even now lingering outside thy back door, no doubt preparing to redress the grievances of thee and thy ancestor. Hasten to seek him, for if thou delay, he will depart. Miss this opportunity, and the unjust grievances of old and young alike must be buried beneath the sea, with no one to plead for you.' Therefore I hastened to fetch the soul of my grandmother; together we have come to implore the great immortal, earnestly hoping for his heavenly favour to redress this grievance, that we may cherish and remember his great virtue."

Presently, the figure changed voice, speaking with that of an old woman, repeating the same words. Lü Dongbin knew this to be the grandmother of the little ghost; his spirit involuntarily became solemn. "What the earth god says is true. I am not unwilling to interfere in the affairs of men, but I have but recently become a monk, and my cultivation is yet slight. This matter of ghosts and spirits is also a thing new to me. I know not what means to employ to save you and redress your grievance."

Hearing this, the two ghosts knelt hastily upon the body of the man and bowed their heads. From the mouth of the man there issued alternating tones, sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes old, sometimes young, speaking together: "Only pray the great immortal to bring the ghosts into his own house. We have our own methods to deal with our enemies. But if trouble is made, the City God’s underlings will come to investigate; then we shall need the great immortal to act as our advocate and bear witness for us. The City God, pitying us as wronged souls, will doubtless bestow special grace, first permitting us to be transformed early into living men; and we shall be ever grateful."

Lü Dongbin said: "If this be so, you may return home yourselves; why must you drag me along?" The voice changed again to that of the old woman, saying: "The front and back gates are guarded by the door gods; we dare not enter alone. The great immortal must lead us once, after which we may come and go at will." Lü Dongbin could but consent, and said: "Follow me, then." As for the man walking by, he was sent back, with instruction not to be troubled.

A-ming replied: "This man is no good either. He beats his father and scolds his mother, commits adultery with his brother’s wife, and sells his nephew away to become a strolling player in a distant place. His conscience has long been dead. Though living in the world, he has no trace of yang energy; only thus can we spirits attach to his body. If he were a man of uprightness and principle, how mighty would be his yang vigour! We mere spirits could not approach him, but would vanish like smoke; how could we dare to trouble him?"

Hearing this, Lü Dongbin sighed deeply and said: "Though this be so, you have no enmity with them. If he does evil, his retribution is his own concern, not yours to meddle with. Now, to go to your home and keep him by your side is also improper. Let him return home." Before he had finished speaking, the man suddenly fell to the ground, as if awakened from a trance. Lü Dongbin paid no heed, but proceeded to the back gate of the Zhu family, picked up a stone, and knocked on the door. He soon saw a light within.

After a while, a woman's voice came, cursing as she opened the door: "In the dead of night, not knowing where you have drunk your fill of strong liquor, and now crawling home to die." Lü Dongbin then knew that Zhu the little ghost had not yet returned. As the door opened, two columns of black smoke rose up from the ground and wrapped about the woman who opened the door.

Lü Dongbin looked closely; it was none other than the scolding woman he had met on the mountain in daylight. Now the woman had been possessed by two spirits and was senseless, leaving the lamp burning unattended, shutting no door, questioning no one, but turning and walking into the house. Suddenly, the indoor cries rose to the ceiling. Following that came the sound of tables being struck, stools beaten, knives and sticks thrown. Shortly after, a man rushed out the back door, fleeing as if pursued by the wind. Lü Dongbin recognized him as the adulterous husband who had entered earlier.

Knowing that the woman Niu had been possessed by the two ghosts and was now mad, he sighed deeply. Seeing no benefit in lingering, he returned by the same path and casually found a pavilion to sit through the night. Early the next morning, he went to inquire about the situation. Unexpectedly, at the gate were hung many Taoist implements. Inside, cymbals, gongs, sheng pipes, and drums made a tumult like a tempest.

Lü Dongbin laughed and said: "This is because the little ghost Zhu has been so disturbed by the two ghosts that they must make a business of his younger brother, trying to expel the two ghosts from the house. Such scoundrels, unable to preserve their own lives, yet wishing to cure the lewd and violent wife!" Thinking this, he could not help but cast a few glances inside. This proved a mistake. A girl appeared at the door, who was none other than Xiao Jinzi. Upon seeing Lü Dongbin, she immediately fled inside.

Soon she brought out a hideous, squat, pockmarked man, probably Zhu the little ghost himself. Another, older and also pockmarked, was dressed as a Taoist; Xiao Jinzi called him uncle.

The elder brothers, upon reaching the door, asked no questions but dragged Lü Dongbin inside, beating and hauling him to the altar where the ritual was in progress. Lü Dongbin asked: "Why do you seize and strike me without cause? I know you not; have we some grudge or enmity?"

The Taoist shouted: "What wild Daoist art thou? Hast thou not inquired what our family is? How dare thee disturb the ruler of the year, and bring in demons to wreak havoc on my elder brother's household?"

Lü Dongbin was about to ask for proof, when the scolding woman inside, hearing his voice, hurried out, prostrated herself, and bowed as if pounding garlic, crying: "Immortal Sir, save us! Immortal Sir, save us!" This bewildered not only Lü Dongbin but also the two pockmarked brothers.

Lü Dongbin, however, understood somewhat, guessing that she spoke of a pair of spirits, old and young. But having just denied everything, he now asked the Taoist brothers for proof. They naturally would not admit it. Lü Dongbin then shouted: "Who art thou, woman, to vex me with such nonsense when I know thee not?"

Unexpectedly, the two spirits, unaware of his difficulty, confirmed: "Great Immortal, we are indeed the mother and son of little ghost Zhu. Last night you took us inside..."

Before the words were finished, Zhu's brothers sneered: "Well, the demons have confessed themselves. No use denying now." Lü Dongbin was at a loss for words. He composed himself and listened as the woman cried: "...yet this drunkard is unreasonable and has called Taoists to perform rites to expel us."

Lü Dongbin was curious and asked: "Have these Taoists skill in magic?"

The woman replied: "Though their magic is slight, their talismans are real. Just now they recited a scripture to subdue demons and spirits. We felt as if burned by fire and pricked by nails. Just as we tried to flee, the great immortal came. Good Immortal, you are a golden immortal of heaven; please see the matter through. Pray command them not to be so foolish. We are their mother and nephew."

Hearing this, Zhu the little ghost said to his brother: "No need to say more. This is a wild Daoist who brought demons in false names of our mother and A-ming to seek me out. He dares to spy about. If it were not for him alone, why would he so attentively inquire early this morning?" These words shut Lü Dongbin’s mouth, and he was silent a long while.

Zhu grew angry: "This wild Daoist is a rogue. Let's imprison him and see what mischief he can do." The Taoists all agreed, saying: "Well deserved!" Some added: "Bind his hands and feet so that even if watchers come, he cannot fly away." The brothers agreed, and all seized to bind Lü Dongbin.

Seeing their numbers, Lü Dongbin knew resistance was useless, and since they were as senseless as deer and boars, he kept silent and did not struggle. They bound him tightly, like a wrapped bundle. Zhu said: "The broken house behind is no longer used to store things. Let's confine him there, and when Xiao Jinzi’s mother recovers, then release him for questioning and punishment, so he dare not come again, without harming his worthless life."

All laughed and with great effort carried the large bundle to the broken house, slammed the door, and locked it. Zhu’s brothers outside said: "We have no skill; we cannot even frighten ghosts. You great Daoist, a transcendent immortal, rest here for some days and then show us some astounding technique."

They departed, leaving Lü Dongbin locked inside, angry and gloomy. The house was a converted privy, redolent of osmanthus scents mingled with foul odors from many broken and filthy household utensils. The smells assailed his nostrils, causing great discomfort.

Lü Dongbin thought: "Although this robe can resist sword and fire, can it shield me from such foul smells?" Luckily his hands were not bound tightly. With a strong effort, he freed his right hand but could not manage the rest. He raised the sleeve high to cover his nose, and indeed, no odor could be perceived. Waving the sleeve about, the foul scent lessened. Having solved this hardest problem, his spirits lightened.

At noon, Zhu’s obstinate daughter Xiao Jinzi brought food to Lü Dongbin. Fearing she might detect a flaw, he kept his hands bound but feigned entreaty, asking her to release his hands to eat.

Xiao Jinzi, noting his handsome appearance and love in her heart, loosened his bonds, quietly smiling: "You Daoist are courting trouble. Even I fear to speak of my family's matters; what concern are they of a stranger? Now the ghosts of grandmother and brother have been driven out by the uncles’ incantations. Mother is no longer mad, though her body is weary, her chest, hands, and face are scratched by grandmother, causing great pain. She will soon be well. Once she recovers, you shall die. My father and uncles are plotting your death."

While eating, Lü Dongbin asked: "Why do not your grandmother and brother seek out the villain surnamed Wang?"

Xiao Jinzi replied: "They have tried, but the man is cunning. When mother went mad, father was absent. Mother seized him, speaking all sorts of ghostly words. Yet he was skilled, not charmed, and pushed mother down, opening the back door and escaping. I know not what magic he used, but he frightened the avenging ghosts away."

Lü Dongbin pondered and begged her to save his life. She thought a moment, then nodded: "There is indeed a way. If they make no moves this afternoon, at night I will take a knife and cut your bonds, letting you escape by the back door. But how will you repay me?"

She smiled coyly at Lü Dongbin, playing the coquette. Lü Dongbin inwardly thought: "This is a dire situation. How can I deal with such a child who has such secret knowledge and boldness? To coax her would be to lie, which a monk cannot do; but to refuse her means she will never free me." After consideration, he said vaguely: "Little maiden, do not speak so plainly. I am not heartless. If fate permits, and we meet again, I will repay you to the best of my ability."

Xiao Jinzi bowed her head in thought: "Is that true?" Lü Dongbin said: "How could a monk lie?" She joyfully promised: "I will surely save you. But I fear that once you finish your meal, my uncle and father will trouble you. Then there will be no remedy." Saying this, she took away the dishes and closed the door.

After her departure, Lü Dongbin wished the sun would hasten, eagerly awaiting Xiao Jinzi’s return to escape. Yet the trouble she feared soon arose. About mid-afternoon, before the hour of the Monkey, footsteps approached. Lü Dongbin groaned, knowing they had come to seize him. Indeed, Zhu’s two brothers and a tall, stalwart Taoist entered. They noticed Lü Dongbin’s freed right hand and wondered: "Who loosened his hand?"

Lü Dongbin smiled: "Since you kindly offered me food, how could I eat with bound hands? I begged for release of one hand. But I am clumsy and awkward; once free, I cannot be bound again. I can only wait your coming to bind me anew."

He bent his right hand behind his back to prepare for binding. Zhu laughed: "This fellow is tough, a hard head who fears not death. We are here to move you to a new place, a quiet and elegant spot fit for a gentleman to rest and abide. Time presses; let us depart."

While he spoke, the two Taoists bound Lü Dongbin’s hands tightly, twisting twice, laughing: "Let us see if he can borrow that claw again."

Zhu hurried: "Brothers, no jesting; get him out and end this worry." The tall Taoist lifted Lü Dongbin onto his shoulder, the two brothers followed behind. They carried him behind the broken house, through a narrow lane, then turned left at a small bend.

Zhu stepped ahead, gently pushing open a bamboo gate. It led to a vast, neglected garden. They went to its eastern end, where a high mound rose. Zhu climbed and looked about: "No ghosts in sight. Let us hasten to give him a housewarming."

Lü Dongbin puzzled, thinking: "These three fools know not where they are leading me." Before he could finish his thought, the Taoist dashed him down to the ground. The fall nearly stunned him.

Opening his eyes, he groaned. Below the mound was a deep pit, bottomless as far as could be seen. The entrance was hidden by thick wild grass, making it unclear. Lü Dongbin worried: "It seems clearly they mean to bury me here in this cave. That is indeed a hidden valley, so why call it a housewarming?"

As he pondered, Zhu ordered: "Brothers, why delay? Put him into the cave. If others pass by, it will be troublesome."

At the command, the Taoist strained and lifted Lü Dongbin, while the brothers pushed aside the grass. Zhu laughed: "This is a good comparison."

His brother asked: "What comparison?" Zhu said: "Is it not like spring grass at a cave’s mouth? Now to stuff this living thing in, what else could it resemble?"

The two Taoists laughed heartily. The brother shook his head: "This is not quite apt. For a good comparison there must be entrance and exit. Now that this thing is in, is there hope of coming out?"

They laughed and laughed again.

Lü Dongbin thought: "I never imagined these Zhu brothers to be such unblinking murderers. No wonder he married such a woman, who slew his son and mother, yet they call themselves loving husband and wife."

As he thought, he felt his body rise in space and heard laboured breathing. Bound like a bundle, he was thrust into the cave. Lü Dongbin, resigned to death, felt no fear.

Within the cave, he rolled downward, striking neither side, showing its vastness. Rolling for about the time of a tea-cup, he had not yet reached the bottom. He wondered if this was one of the fabled bottomless pits.

The entrance was pitch dark with no light. As he rolled deeper, the light increased. After nearly another tea-cup’s time, he felt the ground beneath.

He had expected to be shattered, but midway a hope arose — if his body first found firm ground, the protection of his Daoist robe might save him; at worst he would be shaken and dizzy but survive. As for escape thereafter, he could not think.

Yet the world is full of wonders beyond all imagining. When Lü Dongbin landed, he felt his body soft and comfortable. Opening his eyes, he beheld a sight inconceivable and wondrous.

Beneath that vast deep pool lay a blessed cave heaven. The ground was level as a mirror, the grass soft as down, the fragrance of flowers sweet, bird songs melodious. Pavilions, towers, rocks, and streams decorated the place with natural elegance. The term "quiet and elegant" used by Zhu was but a poor comparison.

The sky was high and clear, clouds light, the air mild and pure, and all who entered felt refreshed in ear and eye, their spirits brightened.

Lü Dongbin was overjoyed. Looking down at himself, he found he lay upon a broad meadow of fragrant grass. The ropes binding him were gone; no pain or numbness remained where his limbs had been bound. From such peril he had come to such a place; he cried aloud, "Today, I, Lü Yan, ascend to the immortal realm!"

Before he finished, a warbler’s voice laughed softly in his ear: "The immortal realm is far away indeed. Today only thou art a guest entering the cave; no slight honour for one named Dongbin."

Turning, Lü Dongbin saw a maiden about seventeen or eighteen years old, leading several girls of about ten years, standing beneath a flowering Tangdi tree and smiling gently.

Lü Dongbin recognized her as the mistress of the place. He hastily rose and bowed, saying, "Disciple Lü Yan, fallen into peril and entering the cave, is fortunate to meet an immortal teacher, and begs for salvation." He bowed his head deeply.

The maiden hurried to return the greeting, saying, "Let us count ourselves friends; to call me immortal teacher would be too great a title, and I dare not accept."

Lü Dongbin arose from his bow. The maiden bade him sit on the grass, and she sat with him. The girls stood about solemnly. She smiled and said: "A man who meddles in others’ affairs and strives to right wrongs is naturally earnest; yet he must consider whether his skill and ability suffice. Moreover, matters have their urgency and sequence. To attend first to urgent matters and later to the less urgent is proper. Dost thou understand?"

Lü Dongbin, full of fear, said: "I understand. I came to study swordsmanship, sent hither by Erlang Shen. I have learned little of the Way, and why seek I out an immortal teacher, instead meddling in others’ affairs? My ignorance has brought these misfortunes. Now I think, might the immortal teacher be He Xian-gu who instructs me in swordsmanship? My worldly eyes failed to see this; I deserve a thousand deaths."

So saying, he rose again, determined to greet her as teacher. He Xian-gu stepped back, shaking her hand and laughing: "To teach the Way is not necessarily to be teacher and pupil. Between us there is no such distinction, only fellowship. If thou treat me as teacher, it will hinder my teaching swordsmanship."

Lü Dongbin yielded and reported his movements, telling how he met the wronged ghosts and brought them home. The immortal smiled: "Thou knowest not that the woman of little ghost Zhu truly deserves death, yet her adulterous husband is a good man. Much good fortune remains for his later years. Such ghosts cannot approach him; if they do, the spiritual radiance above his head repels them, and he is guarded by underworld officials. If ghosts have grievances, how dare they trouble him? In the end, they only torment themselves."

Lü Dongbin was amazed: "Sister immortal, these words accord with what I heard on the mountain; the case is perplexing. If this man be so unworthy and wicked, how come he is said to be so good? I cannot understand."

The immortal laughed: "Not only thou canst not understand; readers may understand even less."

Wait a moment, and after some rest, we shall continue in the next chapter of this book.
