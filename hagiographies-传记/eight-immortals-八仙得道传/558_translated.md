# Chapter 90: The White Snake First Repays the Virtue of Release; The Immortals Still Have Ties Unended

Now it is said, in all affairs under Heaven, nothing is without marvel. Last time we spoke of Lü Dongbin, who, having been cast down into a deep valley, became a guest within a cavern, where he met the long-desired He Xiangu — a matter already most wondrous beyond further marvel.

Yet it was not told that the Fairy spoke to him, revealing that the villain who had treacherously slain two lives was in truth a great man of virtue, who not only would attain great fortune in time to come, but even now was protected by divine beings, who came and went through his inner chamber’s door. Such words — are they not strange beyond all reason? Yet once laid bare, they proved exceedingly simple, and nothing to wonder at. Then, seeing Lü Dongbin’s startled countenance, the Fairy laughed, saying: ‘You likely already understand that the two resentful spirits, the old and the young, have no need of that man surnamed Wang, the villain.’ Lü Dongbin replied: ‘Indeed it is for this that I am most astonished beyond measure!’ The Fairy laughed again: ‘Those who know not the matter, and do not carefully examine, are apt to judge hastily. As for this man named Wang, a betrayer of women, he naturally deserves his blame. But at most, he has only committed adultery…’

Before she had finished, Lü Dongbin interrupted: ‘No, no, according to what I have heard, there are things more grievous than adultery.’ The Fairy smiled: ‘You have heard the words of that child, Niu A Mao, have you not? But it is not only he. In that village, all who know of this case of treacherous killing speak thus. Among those fond of high talk, some even change the facts with falsehoods and exaggerations, turning the truth of the matter on its head. In short, if the case is brought forth, the man named Wang will inevitably be deemed a common murderer. Even the most discerning officials would find it difficult to clear him. Yet all this is but the theory of the mortal realm. As for the twists and turns within, they cannot be hidden from us immortals. Brother Lü Dao, I will speak plainly to you. I dare assert that this man named Wang is not a murderer at all, and indeed he remains in ignorance even of how the old and the young came to their deaths. His dull and muddled state is truly like that of the woman’s husband, Zhu the little devil; they might as well have sworn brotherhood, being of equal measure and alike in every way. This is because Wang is a gentleman of upright conduct. Though the woman named Niu committed adultery with him, she dared not disclose to him such unnatural, rebellious, murderous deeds. Therefore even now he does not believe that the two—old and young—died with wrongs unredressed. As for his faults, they lie only in the crime of violating another’s wife. Know this man is not given to lustful indulgence; though his wife died ten years ago, he has remained faithful, rearing his orphan child and refusing to remarry. Even in the ordinary places of pleasure, his footsteps are seldom found. Why then alone with this woman of the Zhu family has he such secret intimacies? To speak of this, I must first tell you of his former life. You know what that woman of the Zhu family was in her past incarnation? She was a white snake spirit, a talent among the demons of the three or four paths. In that year when the orthodox and heterodox schools battled fiercely at Huaihai village, the sea was nearly turned upside down. Any who have cultivated the Way for some years, and know a few transcendent ones, must have heard somewhat of this.’

Lü Dongbin nodded and said: ‘True enough, my master Yunfang has spoken of this matter.’ The Fairy said: ‘After the defeat, that snake spirit somehow fell into the hands of a fisherman, and was fortunately bought by a kindly person, who released it. Therefore the snake spirit never forgot to repay this great kindness. After more than a thousand years, it obtained permission from its sect master to be reborn as a man, to repay kindness in human form. But the snake demon’s conduct was evil, having harmed many; its destiny ordained that it should not live a contented, peaceful life. So upon coming down to the world, it was mismatched to this Zhu little devil, called to repay kindness but in truth only to become a fleeting consort. Having said this, you should now understand who its benefactor is.’

Lü Dongbin nodded: ‘I see now. This man named Wang was surely the one who released it.’ The Fairy smiled: ‘In human affairs, whether just or unjust, there is mostly a cause in a past life. All say that rightful husbands and wives are predestined in former lives, their names inscribed in the red records of the Moon Elder, and so matched by the red thread of fate. But few know that even such fleeting unions as those of passing couples are not formed by chance. Their names are also inscribed in the marriage registry. As for this man Wang and the woman of the Zhu family, since their illicit love came to pass, is it not true they have some history? Knowing their origin, their matter ceases to be strange.’ Lü Dongbin listened and only nodded.

He Xiangu continued: ‘Yet I know that the entanglement of these two, man and woman, may not be ended in this life alone. Because the snake spirit’s purpose is to repay kindness, and when kindness is not repaid but instead harm is done, the deeper the remorse the more urgent the desire for reparation, and the more difficult the means to be fitting. You and I are fortunate to be transcendent ones, free from mortal snares, and need not fear death from unforeseen calamity. To us, three or five hundred years in the mortal world are but a fleeting moment. What their outcome shall be? Fear not to see it yet.’ Lü Dongbin heard and was greatly amazed, then asked: ‘Fair sister, since you say this, do you know what their future end shall be?’ The Fairy laughed: ‘You are indeed a zealous fellow, meddling in affairs hundreds of years ahead—how can that be allowed? Alas, my Way power is not deep, and I cannot know their full details. Yet I may roughly prophesy: this white snake will again appear five hundred years hence to repay former kindness. The man named Wang will have become a miserly man, yet he must gain some benefit from her, which will be far better than in this life. But the snake spirit itself, burdened by heavy karma, must suffer many years of cruel calamity on behalf of its benefactor. As for the ultimate result, it shall be most happy and complete. Because it ever remembers to repay virtue through life and death, this conscience distinguishes it from common demon sect members. Therefore it moves the heart of Heaven, who permits its renewal and guides it to the right path. These are the broad circumstances and no more.’

Having spoken thus, the writer must here interpose a word, to relate for the reader that the matter of the white snake’s repaying kindness first occurred in the case of the Niu family and the man Wang’s adultery and murder. The second time, five hundred years later, the white woman married Xu Xian in lawful wedlock, but was afterwards subdued by Fa Hai beneath the Leifeng Pagoda at West Lake. Twenty years later, their son became the top scholar, and by imperial order offered sacrifices at the pagoda; the white woman also repented her former sins and returned to Buddhism. Many know this story; it needs no further telling here. Only their first union and affairs remain unknown to the world, so it has been related above, briefly and in one word passed over.

Returning now to Lü Dongbin, having heard the talk, he asked what place this was, and why beneath this deep cavern? How far was it from the plain? Once outside, whither should one go? And why was the Fairy here likewise? The Fairy smiled: ‘This is my newly opened cave dwelling, called the Jade Chamber Cave. Recently, the Patriarch’s command came down, ordering each according to rank to be assigned fixed abodes for cultivation of the True. Iron Crutch Master and Master Yunfang, and others such as Lan Caihe and Zhang Guo, either remain at their original places or have sought new abodes, all nearly arranged. As for you, though not yet accomplished the Way, the Patriarch regards you specially, and has appointed for you a cave dwelling. When the time comes, Master Yunfang will surely take you thither.’

Lü Dongbin bowed hurriedly in empty air to give thanks. The Fairy continued: ‘This was originally a great earth fissure. Being so deep as to have no bottom, no man ever came to disturb it. Three years ago, I accompanied my teacher, the Mysterious Maiden, on a journey hither. When we reached the valley’s foot, we noticed our footsteps sounded lighter than elsewhere. The Mysterious Maiden summoned the Earth Spirit to inquire, and found it true. She laughed and asked me: “Immortal abodes are not on hilltops, nor upon the sea. Now you may try to build a dwelling beneath the earth, would you like that?” I was naturally overjoyed and gave thanks. She then called many spirits and goblin workers, who with their wondrous skills, in but a short time, transformed this abyss into a blessed grotto—spring evermore, no rain at any season. They borrowed the light of sun and moon; day and night are gentle and clear. I dare say, since the time of immortal caves, this place is the most unique and elegant. I recall a phrase in the Zuo Commentary: “Our lord is at the mouth of the valley.” The so-called valley mouth is but a cellar or suchlike made by mortals, only somewhat grander in build, so given that name. Yet compared to my cave, it is but a little wizard to a great one, the difference unknown by tens of thousands of miles. As for the exit from the cave, there are two: the one by which you entered is one. My intention was to plug it with a ball of mud, to prevent future harm from causing falls. Yet the Mysterious Maiden’s power is great indeed. She foresaw you would come to my place to be taught the Heavenly Escape Sword Art, and must enter by this mouth. Therefore she forbade its closure. She said that in a few years, you will find a comrade to teach you the Heavenly Escape Sword. This man must enter by this mouth, and only then can the mouth be sealed. Is not such divine power wondrous beyond words?’

Lü Dongbin again raised his hands in salute and thanked the Mysterious Maiden from afar. The Fairy said: ‘Now that you have come, stay here awhile. Within a day or two I shall arrange for your unfinished business to be settled, and also seal this cave mouth, thus filling a defect in Heaven and Earth. In future, our way out shall be beneath the great waterfall. None without knowledge of the Water Escape may enter the cave; none without Earth Escape, even if they enter, will find it difficult to reach my cave. With this waterfall guarding naturally, it is indeed a marvel beyond belief. Moreover, the waterfall ever flows with rapid current; though there is a cave mouth, ordinary eyes cannot see it. Thus the way seems not to be a way; if one came by reputation and saw the scene beneath the spring, one could only sigh and despair.’

Lü Dongbin listened in admiration, and asked again: ‘Fair sister, you said you would settle my unfinished business—is it on behalf of that woman, the Zhu little devil? Since she and the villain have such ties, why should we trouble ourselves further with such idleness?’ The Fairy laughed: ‘Fate is fate; crime is crime. I do not excuse their adultery, but how can I overlook the crimes of killing son and mother? Moreover, this woman is so cruel. This time, the disaster began with her. Can she escape punishment in the future? Even though her husband Zhu the little devil is so dull and cruel, from their side it may be the continuation of mother and son; yet from your side, though you have not suffered death at their hands, their cruelty is such that the killing of men is but child’s play to them. Such men should not long remain in the world, but share the punishment with their brothers. Even if not slain immediately, they deserve at least crippling punishment, to prevent further harm. As for the man named Wang, his adultery was not of his own heart; though by adultery came killing, he did not partake in it; yet Heaven’s law is clear, good and evil must be recompensed before men. If for original reasons he were exempted, men would suspect Heaven’s justice to be ignorant. Therefore he too must suffer some chastisement. Fortunately, he has done many good deeds and has been good in many lives. His good recompense is deep, and future blessings great. To endure some small suffering for a time is not grievous. This case involves many matters. Human affairs are ordinarily managed by officials, and need not our intervention. Yet because the case is so old and no complaint made, there is grave fear the dead’s grievances remain unrevealed, and the living’s lives endangered. Our immortal sect acts according to fate to do good and save lives everywhere; it is convenient to manifest some retribution for all to see.’

Lü Dongbin nodded in agreement, and said: ‘Fair sister, your words accord with my own thoughts. The worth of immortals and spirits is to admonish and punish the human world. If one were cold and indifferent, caring only for one’s own leisure and ignoring the affairs of men, then though one might be alone virtuous, what benefit would that be to the world?’ The Fairy smiled and said: ‘Men’s minds differ, as their faces differ. This is each man’s view. To each his own wisdom, and each follow his own way.’

Lü Dongbin listened, and felt somewhat lost and despondent. From that day henceforward, he began to study the Heavenly Escape Sword Art within the cave. According to the Fairy, this sword art was first created by the True Man Fire Dragon. But the method was incomplete, only able to change at will, coming and going as desired. Later the Mysterious Maiden obtained it and further refined it, so that by her method, when perfected, one may infuse the sword with spirit and hide the sword in the heart. Where the mind goes, the spirit follows, and the sword gathers its effect. It is not only for preserving life and saving the world, but can intricately weave all things and refine Heaven and Earth. Even the Great Golden Immortals cannot fathom its ends. Lü Dongbin’s nature was pure, unlike the common, and unlike other immortals; once guided, he attained the samadhi. The Fairy said that before, the Mysterious Maiden took thirty years to teach others the sword art to some degree. Now Lü Dongbin, within a few days, has grasped its essentials, surpassing the Fairy and even the Mysterious Maiden. The Fairy further said: ‘Judging by Lü Dongbin’s talents, within three years he may master all its changes. Afterwards, his cultivation may strengthen by borrowing the sword’s energy, making power easier to command. When sword study is profound, man and sword become one; man wields the sword, and sword energy controls worldly thoughts, enabling body and spirit to advance unseen. This is truly a divine sword of wondrous effect. How can an ordinary treasured sword compare?’

Three years passed in the cave, and Lü Dongbin had learned the sword art in its main features. He also practised thoroughly the various magic arts taught by Zhongli Quan. All common arts of escape and transformation, and the summoning of generals and spirits, he could now employ. The Fairy laughed and said: ‘Having learned the sword art, you need a divine sword to match. Recall your master’s three-year appointment; go quickly to the meeting place to seek him, and ask him to find you a good sword, which must be further cultivated before you can wield it at ease.’ Lü Dongbin heard this, and made eight bows to her, thanking her for teaching the sword art, and begged the Fairy to send him out of the cave. The Fairy laughed: ‘You have studied for these three years, equalling a hundred years’ effort of others. Now you must leave the cave and enter the water, which is as level ground. Though I need not see you off, that is no matter. But I must go overseas to visit a disciple, so I shall accompany you a part of the way.’

Immortals act with the utmost freedom, unlike mortals, who have many ties and formalities in leaving. They went forth, she first, he after, hardly a few steps when they heard the sound of flowing water striking rocks. Lü Dongbin thought: ‘Can it be that the waterfall above pours all the way down here? Such a source is indeed remote.’ Yet, looking up, he saw the place whence the waterfall descended; it was but a short distance. Having climbed from the lowest part to the mountain’s summit, he was quite astonished. The Fairy laughed: ‘Why do you stare? Immortals on the road must travel like common folk, one step at a time, a stage at a time, orderly advancing. How can one travel ten thousand li in a day or cross four seas in a night?’ Lü Dongbin then understood that she had applied the art of shrinking the earth, and smiled quietly. The Fairy said: ‘Now show some of the skills you have learned these three years. If one learns magic and never tries it, when the time comes to use it one is sure to be stiff and awkward, unable to act naturally, and even panic, thus causing greater harm.’

Lü Dongbin smiled, formed the Water Avoidance hand seal, and boldly entered beneath the waterfall. Indeed, passing through myriad streams, his clothes were not wetted at all. Together with the Fairy he ascended the mountain peak, where she pointed to a village below and said: ‘Do you remember this is the place where you formerly sought justice for a wrong and caused a disturbance?’ Lü Dongbin laughed: ‘Indeed. I have feared to speak of it for fear of disturbing my heart. But now, fair sister, tell me how you have punished that licentious woman, her foolish and poisonous husband, and the adulterer. Are those people still in the world?’ The Fairy said: ‘Is it not easy to settle? But I do not need to act myself. I merely caused the woman to become ill and forced her to write a confession. Then I made clear to them that the one who entered the earth cave was a true immortal, one who with good intention sought to redress wrongs for the dead and protect lives for you living. This made the brothers repent bitterly. They even wished to find you in the cave, and before your face bury the woman alive or cast her into the cave, then apologize to you. I said, since he is an immortal, though the cave be small, even if buried beneath Mount Lu, he could come forth; how could you harm a single hair of his? But if you sought to find him now, you would first lose your lives in the cave, which is needless. You live in a prosperous age, yet dare to privately harm a stranger; such crime must be punished. So they cut off their feet. As for Niu, she was promptly killed. Only the adulterer, whom I discovered was named Wang Keming, was spared out of pity, since his fault was unintentional and he was kind by nature. I let him go. I see from his looks he is not vulgar; though he committed this crime, his forehead is still bright. Surely within five years he will rise to high rank.’

Lü Dongbin asked: ‘What of the daughter of the Zhu little devil, Xiao Jinzi? Is she not now an orphan without father or mother? The child is fair and uncommon in looks. Alas, born to such a family and trained in low ways, she has acquired much evil habit, in speech and conduct provoking dislike everywhere. To judge fairly, this is not truly her own sin, but rather her misfortune.’ The Fairy nodded and smiled: ‘A child when first born has no wickedness whatsoever. As she grows, external things entice and lead her astray, and she gradually becomes bad. This is indeed because her nature is not good, and she is easily led. Ultimately, the allurements of youth are more blameworthy than youth itself.’ Lü Dongbin sighed: ‘This child was lively and clear-souled; I wonder now where she has drifted.’ The Fairy sighed also, then suddenly smiled: ‘Oh, I remember now. When you met that child on the mountain top, there was another child acting as your matchmaker. No wonder you still think of her.’ Lü Dongbin laughed: ‘You are my elder and teacher; do not thus mock me. When I see my master tomorrow, I shall tell him that you have taught me to do wrong. Do you think my master would agree with you?’

Her words made the Fairy laugh heartily, saying: ‘Do not talk nonsense. I do not jest wholly. What did you say to that girl in the Zhu little devil’s house? What did you promise her? Remember well. Immortals do not speak in jest or falsehood. Once spoken, it becomes cause and effect. I am kindly advising you: better go slowly to the Xiang River, find this child, and consider how to save her early, thus fulfilling your promise and repaying your debt. Is not that good?’ Lü Dongbin laughed: ‘Today, fair sister speaks all in jest; what can this mean?’ The Fairy laughed again, nodding: ‘The words are jest, yet truly this child will soon die. You can no longer help her now. But immortals act openly and honestly. Though no danger has come to you on her account, still to abandon her so is near to burning the bridge after crossing. This is not fitting for us. Wait and see. This soul was not born to benefit you; in the next life she will be your lover once more. When you two are lovingly together, you may recall this jest from your pillow-side.’

Lü Dongbin understood the reason in her words, but would not admit it, smiling evasively: ‘Enough, enough, master’s appointment time is come; I must hurry to the Xiang River and not linger here idly.’ The Fairy laughed: ‘Indeed. Let us part here. I must go overseas to visit a disciple. I hear that recently this disciple has done a great deed, winning great honour for China. I must hasten to praise him.’ Lü Dongbin asked: ‘Is this disciple not the one named Wang Tai?’ The Fairy waved her hand: ‘Yes, yes. Come, let us go. There is no time for more talk.’ Saying this, she rose on a cloud and vanished in an instant. Lü Dongbin also hastened to the Xiang River.

What follows is yet unknown; we shall see in the next chapter.
