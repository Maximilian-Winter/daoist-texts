# Chapter 97: Swinging on a Copper Coin — Delivering a Compassionate Mother, Ending the Karmic Bonds of the Mortal World

It is said that Lord Cao Guojiu was the brother of the Empress Dowager Cao of Song. The two brothers were born of the same mother; the elder was named Guojiu, the younger was called Cao Er. Though born of one mother, their natures and conduct were greatly unlike. Guojiu was benevolent and magnanimous, tranquil and indifferent to worldly affairs, delighting in the practice of virtue and shunning contention with the world. Though dwelling in the midst of the bustling city, he never concerned himself with the matters of court or state. Yet when any sought his aid in suffering and hardship, so far as his power extended, he was indefatigable in rendering help. Hence the people called him a great man of kindness.

Cao Er, however, was of a very different temper — sinister and cruel, greedy as if his life depended on wealth. Though he was the younger brother of Guojiu, he was miserly by nature, often wielding his imperial kinship and influence to oppress the common folk. Whether the sum was great or small, if he could seize it, not a single coin would be spared. When silver came into his hands, under no circumstance would he part with a farthing. For several decades, for the sake of this one character 'wealth', he plundered and extorted, openly demanding or secretly robbing, unknown were the numbers of lives destroyed, families broken apart. Guojiu repeatedly admonished him in vain, and was compelled to petition the Empress Dowager to divide their household, to dwell apart. Yet, since they lived in the same city, some matters still involuntarily involved himself. Many who suffered under Cao Er’s cruelty came to Guojiu, weeping and imploring him for help.

Finding no recourse with his younger brother, Guojiu exerted himself to the utmost, emptying his purse to compensate the injured parties. But being one who loved not wealth, he would not accept money without cause. He and his family lived simply and frugally; yet because of Cao Er’s affairs, the compensation he paid yearly was no small sum, so that the illustrious Guojiu was reduced to poverty. Yet his heart loved only the great Way; fame and gain he held in no esteem. Moreover, being of imperial kin, no matter how poor he became — a single dish of vegetables, a garment of coarse cloth — these were assured. With these supports, he was content.

He often said to others: ‘I have received the grace of the imperial family, and eat without tilling, wear clothes without weaving. Freed from the toil of mundane life, I pass my time in quiet chambers, burning incense and devoutly cultivating the Way. Such blessings I know not from how many past lives I have accumulated. Yet my younger brother spends his days and nights intent on others’ money, caring not whether it be money earned by selling one’s self or from ruin, he accepts it all with a smile. I know not what use all this money is to him. If he were to consume it himself, with only one mouth and one body, it is not certain he eats or wears more than I, who have no wealth. As for leaving it to his sons, alas, those young men have been ruined by his wealth, becoming prodigal, skillless save in debauchery and gambling. It is better with my two children; they still read a little. Though not remarkable, they are not, as so many say, mere embroidered pillows of princely households — fair outside but insubstantial within. Thus, it seems the rich suffer greater loss than the poor. Yet he cannot see this. I wonder what thoughts dwell in his heart.’

From more than twenty years of age, Cao Guojiu entered long fasting and Daoist cultivation. After thirty, he was visited by the two immortals Lü and Han, who tested the firmness of his Daoist heart; the result was most satisfactory. Upon their departure, they revealed their true forms and ascended to Heaven, that he might behold with his own eyes that immortals truly exist, thus strengthening his resolve. Later, Han Xiangzi again came to his home, discoursing with him for three days on the great Way, inspiring Guojiu’s reverence beyond measure. From then Xiangzi stayed in his mansion. Though sometimes travelling north and south, when affairs were settled he would return and reside there. In the space of more than ten years, Guojiu, devout and single-minded, attained considerable Daoist accomplishment and became versed in many magical arts. Xiangzi commanded him to wait a few more years, until his brother’s evil deeds were full, and his own sons were established — then he should become a monk, roam the mountains and waters, and strengthen his body and bones. Guojiu, hearing this, knew that his brother’s end would be ill.

He was a most filial and friendly man, and his heart was filled with grief. He twice and thrice gave mild and indirect admonitions to his brother. But Cao Er all his life knew only the word ‘wealth’, and neither retribution nor the great Way entered his heart. Sometimes, when Guojiu’s urgings grew urgent, tears would almost fall as he spoke. Cao Er would laugh heartily, saying his elder brother was foolish and would soon become mad, then sent for a royal physician from the Imperial Hospital to diagnose Guojiu’s pulse. When the doctor came, he left Guojiu bewildered. On enquiry, he learned it was his good brother’s friendly heart that had brought the doctor to treat his mental illness. Guojiu was both amused and vexed, and courteously dismissed the doctor.

When Xiangzi heard this, he laughed till he nearly fell. He said to Guojiu: ‘Your younger brother’s crimes are so great as to fill the bamboo slips; his fate in the netherworld is already fixed. How can you save him?’ Guojiu wept, saying: ‘How could I not know that such a man is as stubborn as an ox, as dull as a hog, and as sinister and cruel as a crafty fox, greedy beyond measure like a wolf? There is no reasoning with him. Yet I grieve that I, as elder brother, could not restrain him in youth, allowing his vile nature to grow, nor persuade him later, so that he fell into disorder. This weighs on my heart and I know no peace. I only seek peace of mind, and exert myself to the utmost; if I can turn but one evil thought back, it is my duty as brother fulfilled. Whether he listens or not, whether he reforms or not, the choice is his; what power have I?’ Xiangzi sighed deeply.

One day, on Guojiu’s birthday, Cao Er and his family came to the mansion to pay respects. Guojiu, weary of noise, did not summon relatives and friends; but his own family he could not refuse, and so set a feast. At the banquet, Cao Er spoke much of fame and profit. Guojiu, however, spoke ceaselessly of nature and principle. The brothers’ conversation was at opposite extremes. Suddenly Guojiu thought of something, and said: ‘On this humble brother’s unworthy day, I am grateful to my brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews and nieces who come to toast me. I have lately learned a little trifle, made it, and ask if it may serve to accompany our wine?’ Cao Er and wife laughed, saying: ‘It is rare that elder brother is glad; we are eager to partake.’ The children, hearing of a new plaything, were overjoyed and rushed to Guojiu’s side to see how it worked.

Guojiu ordered a cash coin to be brought. Through the hole in the coin two threads were passed in a cross. Holding it aloft, he blew upon it, chanting spells, and called out loudly. The coin gradually enlarged until it was about the size of a small copper gong. Guojiu then closed his eyes, muttering incantations, conjuring a great rat. He caught it and placed it in the centre of the coin’s hole; at a sharp call, the rat somersaulted within the coin, turning over and over along the cross threads, now up, now down, now east, now west, tumbling without end, causing men, women, boys, and girls to burst into hearty laughter.

Cao Er also applauded loudly: ‘Brother’s skill and spirit are admirable. A single rat can perform such a trick. I wonder when you trained it. But it only turns over and over, always within the coin’s hole, never escaping the circle. It seems not very amusing.’ Guojiu, hearing this, quickly said: ‘So brother means to say that tumbling inside the coin’s hole is not very amusing?’ Cao Er said: ‘Exactly so. If it could tumble outside the circle, that would be a greater skill.’

Guojiu cried aloud: ‘Oh, brother means it should jump out of the coin’s hole? Alas! Brother, this rat has only this small talent — to turn over and over, all within the coin’s hole. I have tried to teach it to tumble outside the circle many times, but it will not understand. It seems that it must tumble a thousand or ten thousand times, till dizzy and confused, till its four legs point straight up, before it can tumble beyond the circle. But then it will be dead. What use is that? It would only bring endless mockery and scorn. Such is the rat’s understanding and talent, hardly worth a smile!’

While he spoke, he furtively watched Cao Er. Unknown to Guojiu, Cao Er was truly obstinate; whether he really did not understand or only feigned ignorance, he merely laughed derisively. Meanwhile the rat continued tumbling without pause. Seeing his brother so dull, Guojiu chased the rat away and said: ‘This sort of plaything is called tumbling within the copper coin’s hole. As for such a coin, its magic is great — it not only makes men tumble, but can make men swing!’ He then removed the cross threads from the coin’s hole, replacing them with two parallel threads, binding a small horizontal stick below, thus making a swing. Blowing upon it and calling loudly, he enlarged the coin again to the size of a great gong, then conjured a white rabbit, placing it upon the swing board. The rabbit swung ceaselessly, rocking up and down with great vigour, causing another burst of laughter. Guojiu saw that Cao Er still paid little heed, and his heart was seized with a pang of sadness. Yet he endured, sighed, and said: ‘Look you, this rabbit is no less foolish than the rat. Relying on the power of the coin, it swings endlessly within the hole, to and fro. Yet it is but the same. In the end, the rabbit swings itself to death. When dead, the coin returns to my pouch. It cannot carry a single coin away. Is it not pitiful? Is it not laughable?’

Hearing this, Cao Er blushed somewhat, but bantered with loud laughter, taking the opportunity to close the matter: ‘Enough, enough, brother, cease your play. Let us drink a few more cups, lest the rabbit and rat laugh that we only know how to swing and tumble, and cannot enjoy a moment of quiet bliss.’ Guojiu put away the coin, released the rabbit, and raised his cup to his brother, smiling: ‘To enjoy quiet bliss, one must never be like these rabbits and rats. Only when all jump beyond the coin’s hole can they be free and at ease, forever contented. If they remain ever chasing after fame and profit, in the end, when their time is up, are they not like the rabbit and rat, but playing tricks for our amusement? They sweat and toil, and become our laughing-stock. In the end, not even a single coin’s power is theirs — what misery! Therefore the wise place greatest value on the study of life and the quest for immortality. All things in this world, be they beautiful or amusing, tasty or useful, are like this copper coin. They are not truly ours. Even if temporarily possessed, we are but short-term keepers, slaves to the world. The more wealth gathered, the harder the keeping, and the more perilous the life; truly it is the most unworthy concern of man!’

Guojiu fancied that his words were heartfelt and penetrating. Yet Cao Er heard only annoyance, hatred stirred within him at every turn. Hearing thus, he turned and joined Guojiu’s wife in guessing games and drinking, a covert mockery to silence his elder brother. Guojiu’s burning heart was plunged into an ice-cold prison. He felt that Xiangzi’s saying, that fate was fixed in the netherworld, was not mistaken. Cao Er was so lost, and such bitter words only provoked loathing and alienated fraternal affection. It seemed the decree was fixed, and human effort could scarcely retrieve it. Henceforth he resolved to let things be, each to his own path, and to await his own attainment of the great Way, to return and seek to save his brother from the sea of sin. He related this intention to Xiangzi.

Xiangzi laughed: ‘I told you long ago, all is predetermined. You act out of brotherly love, and knowing it cannot be done, you still attempt it. It is your goodwill, and I cannot forbid you, but indeed it is of no effect!’ Guojiu was silent long. Xiangzi then urged him to abandon others, and attend to his own future. Guojiu heeding this advice, devoted himself thereafter to his own cultivation, never stepping beyond his gate.

Xiangzi, meanwhile, was summoned by the other immortals to attend Mount Tai, to arrange the reunion of Wang Tai with his mother. They parted for a time, agreeing to meet again three years hence on the summit of Heng Mountain. Guojiu remembered this, and guarded himself in quiet at home for over a year. Indeed, his brother Cao Er, reported by the people and impeached by the censor, was summoned for judicial inquiry, the Empress Dowager having passed, and the court transformed. Cao Er and his faction were dismissed from office; their power greatly diminished. Cao Er himself was brought to justice and executed. His family was pardoned exile, but their property confiscated. Guojiu, who had no dealings with external affairs and no connections, escaped implication. Instead, he took charge of Cao Er’s household affairs and burial. When matters were settled, he entrusted his own family affairs to his two sons, donned straw sandals and carried his bamboo staff, and departed his home to journey to Heng Mountain to meet Han Xiangzi.

Though years in cultivation, Guojiu had never left the capital. Now, undertaking this long and arduous journey, enduring wind and frost, was not to be spoken of. Fortunately, he had mastered many magical arts sufficient to resist many demons and evil ways, and so encountered no grave peril, arriving safely at the summit of Heng Mountain in Hunan. Xiangzi was already there, having prepared a stone chamber for him. The brothers met with great joy. Xiangzi smiled: ‘See now, though you have travelled this distance, I have prepared for you a brand new home. Those who cultivate immortality and the Way seldom find greater satisfaction than you. This is because for centuries your cultivation was diligent and your merit great, so the Patriarch Iron Crutch specially fostered you, thus your marvels today.’

Guojiu thanked him and inquired of Wang Tai’s affairs. Xiangzi laughed: ‘That was a matter arranged by the immortals centuries ago. Now only the appointed steps are followed. The key figure in this is only the Great Immortaless He. Because Lady Yuan-zhen’s period of calamity has ended, she should be freed. The Immortaless invited us all to Mount Tai, then on to Penglai, to summon her son Wang Tai. We held a meeting and resolved to send a joint letter to Erlang, first in courtesy and then by force. It was Elder Yue who arranged the marriage for Wang Chang; later Erlang, fearful of the immortals, retired to Guankou, sending Elder Yue to summon him. Thus the letter went by Elder Yue. Erlang’s temper is well known; he was furious at the interference and accused us of gathering to oppress him, devoid of friendship. He threatened to report to the Jade Emperor, calling upon all heavenly soldiers and generals to confront us. Such words were unreasonable. Yet as we know him well, knowing he would show no mercy, we were not greatly angered. We summoned Wang Tai, bidding him seek his maternal uncle to arrange terms and rescue his mother. About a dozen immortals lent him treasures and promised support in the rear, so he need not fear.’

Wang Tai’s heart was as if cut by a knife, his mother long imprisoned under Mount Tai. He wished alone to seek Erlang, but was repeatedly dissuaded by Immortaless He. He wished to cleave Mount Tai and rescue his mother, but was advised by Zhang Guolao: ‘Though your mother lies beneath the mountain, she fares better than in a temple. When her calamity ends, she will be freed. With your power, this mountain is but a trifle; not just cleaving a path, but moving the entire mountain many thousands of li is no difficulty. Yet Erlang has not agreed, and enmity remains. Even if your mother is freed, she will suffer misfortune. Better wait until her punishment is fulfilled and calamity passed, then Erlang cannot refuse. If he still oversteps, it will be against Heaven and humanity. With so many immortals, are we not able to help you?’ Wang Tai was speechless.

Later, his father Wang Chang attained earth-immortalhood, came to the mountain foot, and met his wife. Wang Tai, by Immortaless He’s direction, also came to meet. The family reunited in the cavern dwelling beneath the mountain, their lamentations roused the Patriarchs Yuanshi and Laojun, who with great compassion interceded before the Jade Emperor, petitioning that Yuan-zhen be freed this very month. Yet Erlang remained stubborn. Wang Tai, emboldened and justified, prepared to do battle with his maternal uncle. With the immortals’ aid, his courage multiplied a hundredfold. He borrowed the treasure sword from Master Lü Chunyang, ascended the clouds to the Ninth Heaven, and sought Erlang’s palace in the Three Realms.

Erlang was informed and immediately marshalled his soldiers for battle. Wang Tai, taught by many immortals and armed with many treasures, was no ordinary foe. Erlang was likewise formidable. They were evenly matched in power. Later they competed in swordsmanship and magic, array and tactics. A fierce battle ensued, but Erlang was defeated by Wang Tai’s sword. For Wang Tai had learned the Xuan-nü Heavenly Escape Sword Technique and wielded Master Lü’s Ganjiang treasure sword, the foremost sword in heaven and earth with the premier swordsmanship of the Nine Streams of the Three Realms. How could Erlang withstand? He was driven into the sea. Erlang and Pinghe were well acquainted, and Pinghe came from the western sea, Guankou’s domain. Thus they had a somewhat lord-and-subject relationship. Upon hearing of Wang Tai’s arrival, Pinghe led the sea gods to protect him and sought to mediate. The result was Erlang allowed Wang Tai to cleave the mountain and rescue his mother, on condition that Wang Tai and his mother bow and confess. The matter was settled with no ill will. Erlang reluctantly consented. Pinghe first led Wang Tai to pay respects to his uncle, then Erlang accompanied him to Mount Tai, lifted the talisman, and Wang Tai with a single axe split Mount Tai in two, releasing his mother to meet Erlang. Thus an old case of immortal and mortal marriage was finally resolved.

After relating this, Xiangzi inquired once more into Guojiu’s affairs, imparting many mystical Daoist teachings for his practice in the mountain. Another twenty years passed, when Master Lü, by Laojun’s command, bestowed the Lingxu Jade Register of the Eight Scenic Palaces. Ten more years passed; upon completion of its study, Guojiu fully attained the Way. Along with Li Tieguai, Zhongli Quan, Lü Dongbin, Immortaless He, Lan Caihe, Zhang Guo, and Han Xiangzi, he formed the Eight Immortals, the famed Eight Taoist Immortals of the world.

Here ends this portion of the account of the Eight Immortals’ cultivation. Yet several great events remain regarding their attainment. Let not the reader grow impatient, but await the next chapter.
