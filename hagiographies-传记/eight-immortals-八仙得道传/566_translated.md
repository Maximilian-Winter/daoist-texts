# Chapter 98: The White Serpent Endures Tribulations and Attains the True Fruit; A Filial Son Cuts His Arm and Encounters Immortals

It is related that the Eight Immortals, having attained the Way, ascended to Heaven, being led by the august personages Yuan Shi Lao Jun, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, and the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, each a leader among the immortals, guiding the court to the celestial throne. The Jade Emperor gave a banquet and conferred titles, also granting each a dwelling in a grotto; he specially appointed Venus, Li Chang Geng, to lead the artisans of the Celestial Mansion to the various mountains to build their abodes. Master Iron Crutch dwelt in the Purple Mist Cave on Mount Hua; Zhang Guo made his home in the White Dew Rock on Mount Wudang; Lan Caihe resided in the Silken Cloud Valley on Mount Wangwu; Lü Dongbin in the Delicate Cloud Cliff on Mount Emei; He Xiangu in the Jade Chamber Cave on Mount Lu; Han Xiangzi on the Azure Cloud Peak of Mount Song; Zhongli Quan in the One-Line Sky of Mount Zhongnan; and Lord Cao, the Imperial Uncle, in the Wondrous Peak of Mount Heng. These are what men now call the Eight Grotto Immortals. Within each grotto, there were pure and refined scenes of seclusion, flowers blooming through all the seasons; and the Jade Emperor with other Daoist ancestors bestowed gifts, as did each one's master, senior uncles, and brothers — not one lacking in rarity and exquisite workmanship, surpassing the skill of Heaven itself.

The Eight Immortals accepted their offices and thanked for the rewards. The Jade Emperor specially issued a decree, the purport of which was this: formerly, the Celestial Court was not at peace, and in seeking worthy men to assist, the various immortal leaders were received, and true talents recommended and promoted. Over several thousands of years, eight immortals were successively obtained, all men of profound attainment and vast supernatural powers, each already granted illustrious ranks and serving in the court. Yet now it is observed that the hearts of men below grow ever more base, and the world's customs more depraved and depraved, so that the state of the world is filled with turmoil. It has long been planned to select worthy men to dispatch to the mortal realm, to incarnate among the people, and at suitable times to punish wickedness and encourage goodness, but as true talents are rare, this has not yet been carried out. Now the Eight Immortals all come from among men, and clearly see worldly affairs; if they were placed within the mortal realm, they would surely be able to turn back the world's depravity. This matter has been discussed and agreed upon by Yuan Shi Lao Jun and other great Daoist ancestors. Moreover, now that the Celestial Court is tranquil and the firmament clear, the duties of the Celestial Mansion are comparatively light; it is just the right time to dispatch them to the world, to tour the four seas, and so, in the intervals of harmonizing yin and yang, to undertake the task of enlightening and transforming the people below. The Eight Immortals accepted their commission, all joyous and dancing, praising the sage virtue. When all was settled, each returned to their allotted grotto to rest for a time.

At the end of the Northern Song, the world was in great disorder. The Immortals once more gathered, meeting at the Purple Mist Cave of Master Iron Crutch on Mount Hua. They heard that the region around Suzhou and Hangzhou was recently renowned for its wealth; and that West Lake in Hangzhou, adorned and maintained by generations of famous men, had become the foremost scenic spot in all the world. Lü Zu first proposed they visit these two places, then separate and each tour the world once, to meet again later and receive further orders. Hearing this, all agreed. So they mounted the clouds and rose, alighting at the foot of Mount Jinshan on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Why was it that Immortal Maiden, Li Tieguai, and several others had some connection with the history of Mount Jinshan, and thus first assembled at this place? They sought out the ancient sites, and could not but be moved somewhat. Zhang Guo and Caihe inquired whether the ink traces of the Dragon King’s own writing were still to be found. He Xiangu laughed and said, “This is indeed a fine relic; but alas, it was destroyed and sunk beneath the river by the demon serpent. Do you not know the matter of the White Serpent Spirit flooding Mount Jinshan?” Some of the Immortals did not know and quickly asked, “What is the matter?”

The Immortal Maiden, seeing their inquiry, began to tell the story, which was truly both laughable and vexing. She said to Lü Zu with a smile, “Brother Dao, you should know something of this.” Lü Zu spat and said, “How should I know of such demon spirits and goblin matters?” He Xiangu smiled at Zhang Guo and said, “Daoist friend Zhang, listen — our Lü Daoist friend is indeed accounted the most covetous and unkind among the immortals.” These words caused the assembled immortals to cover their mouths in astonishment, all looking to Lü Zu with smiles; Lü Zu laughed heartily and said, “Very well, say what you will of me. All the most contemptible and shameful matters among immortals are laid at my door. If there be anything unpleasant among you, lay it all upon me, Lü Dongbin. In any case, I am resolved to bear filth and defilement, and to sacrifice myself in the Way; say what you please. Is this not generosity?” Hearing this, all the immortals laughed uproariously. The Immortal Maiden said, “Did I say I was blaming you? Hold your tongue — let me relate this story, and all may judge fairly. Do you remember what I said to you on Mount Lu? Do you know who this White Serpent really is?”

Lü Zu, hearing this, could not recall at once. Even Zhang Guo was confused and did not clearly understand. The Immortal Maiden nodded at Lü Zu and sneered, “What a heartless and covetous immortal you are! At first I bore no resentment, but now seeing your callousness, it truly rouses all the anger in my belly. To speak plainly, this ancient relic must be recompensed by you, for it was your own mother-in-law who cast it into the river!” Upon these words, the immortals laughed till their sides ached. Lü Zu then suddenly understood and said to Zhang Xian, “So this is the matter she speaks of. Senior Uncle, you may also remember. In the time of Emperor Yuan Zong of Tang, when you were still the imperial tutor to the Tang Emperor, do you remember going with me to see a courtesan named Bai Mudan?” Before he finished, Zhang Xian suddenly realized, “It seems this serpent spirit must be Bai Mudan’s mother; so you, nephew Lü, have become the serpent spirit’s son-in-law. Nephew, I do not mean to blame you, but since you ordered your kin to do this, how can you deny knowledge? This proves your craftiness. If you were truly ignorant and had no dealings with them, it would show your heartlessness; or if, seeing their decline, you feigned folly, that would show covetousness.” Zhang Xian, being the most sincere among the Eight Immortals, was seldom heard joking. Now seeing him also tease Lü Zu, all burst into loud laughter. “Old Zhang is the saint among us; how can his words be amiss? Lü Gong, if you have any defense, speak now, and all will judge fairly.” Lü Zu only smiled, saying nothing. The Immortal Maiden then related this story in full.

“It seems that the serpent spirit, having been reborn as a wife in the Zhu family, and after conspiring with her lover, was first discovered by Lü Zu to have committed treachery, and then personally investigated by the Immortal Maiden. This woman claimed that she aimed at repaying kindness, differing from ordinary treacheries. Though she caused two deaths, it was because these two men first opposed her, preventing her from repaying kindness, so she plotted their deaths — this being unavoidable, and thus differing greatly from common murder. Therefore she bitterly resented the Immortal Maiden for interfering, spoiling her good work and causing her death; after death, her resentment remained. Originally such an evil ghost should have fallen to the underworld to suffer diverse torments; yet through her master’s efforts she pleaded with the King of Hell and forcibly took her soul, hiding it in a magical treasure called the Soul-Collecting Bag. Therein it remained two or three hundred years, often sprayed with magical water; first a wisp of black vapor, later gradually forming the shape of a serpent, until she was released from the bag and taught magical arts, changing into human form. Only in the reign of Emperor Shen Zong of Song did she succeed in cultivation. Hearing that her benefactor had been reborn as a man named Xu Xian at West Lake in Hangzhou, she ardently sought to repay the kindness. Asking her master, she determined to descend the mountain into Zhejiang to seek out this Xu Xian. The Celestial Master Tongtian knew this journey would be fraught with danger and earnestly forbade it. But the White Serpent, upon learning that her benefactor was living, was restless night and day. After some time, she secretly descended the mountain without her master’s consent, found Xu Xian, and married him properly, helping him establish his family and amass great wealth. Unexpectedly, on the Dragon Boat Festival, the White Serpent drank too much wine and revealed her true form — a large and mighty serpent coiled upon the bed. Xu Xian lifted the curtain, and was immediately so frightened that he died. The White Serpent, awakened, wept bitterly; hearing that the Queen Mother’s garden had the greatest number of immortal herbs, she fetched a sprig that might restore life. But on the way back, she was pursued by the garden’s divine guardians. Luckily she was pregnant, the term near ten months. Heaven pitied her loyal gratitude, unchanging after tribulations, and specially bestowed upon her a fine qilin child, who would become a top scholar and be protected by the gods. The two sides fought fiercely without resolution; the White Serpent, seeing she could no longer hold out, had the divine spirit protecting the God of Literature explain the circumstances to the opposing generals, and was released to return home and save Xu Xian. Unexpectedly, when Xu Xian recovered, he went to Jinshan Temple to offer thanks. The abbot, Fa Hai, was a highly accomplished monk, knowing Xu Xian was bewitched by a demon; although she came to repay kindness, having long associated with demons, he foresaw she would harm him. So he invited Xu Xian into the abbot’s quarters, explaining the karmic cause and effect of the past life, urging him to become a monk and not return home. Xu Xian, still fearful over the Dragon Boat Festival incident, though repeatedly reassured by the White Serpent, remained doubtful. Now hearing Fa Hai’s words revealing all, he was greatly alarmed and resolved to heed the abbot’s advice, refusing to return home.

The White Serpent, on learning this, led three thousand demon soldiers to attack Jinshan, flooding the temple with water. Yet her magical arts were no match for Fa Hai. Moreover, being pregnant and with Xu Xian a worldly top scholar, both Daoist and Buddhist sects hesitated to act fully. In the end, Fa Hai summoned Xu Xian, telling him to return home temporarily, and to wait until his wife gave birth before rescuing him to become a monk. Xu Xian had to follow the White Serpent back home.

Before leaving, the White Serpent, seeing the large inscription on Mount Jinshan written by the Dragon King and knowing its connection to He Xiangu, used her magic to push this great stone into the river, venting her long-standing anger. But a sea yaksha saw and hastened to report to the Dragon King, who was furious and sent troops in pursuit. Upon arriving at Mount Jinshan, Fa Hai notified him that the White Serpent had not yet arrived to bring disaster. The Dragon King, unable to act, retrieved the great stone and returned to the Crystal Palace. Thus the great stone was hidden in the Dragon Palace and has not been seen in the mortal world since.”

The Immortal Maiden, having finished speaking, smiled at Lü Zu and said, “Brother Dao, do you understand clearly? Let us all judge the matter. This was the doing of your honored mother-in-law. Moreover, my enmity with your mother-in-law also arose because of you. Unexpectedly, you gained her daughter as a lover, and I suffered the calamity on your behalf. How did this arise? To put it briefly, your mother-in-law destroyed my memorial relic. You should compensate me accordingly, and not hide aside, feigning negligence.” Lü Zu laughed and said, “Do not be so perverse. Do you know that my lover Bai Mudan is now nearing success in cultivation? She remembers the old grudge of having killed her mother, and is preparing to bring great accusations against you. At that time, for the sake of my lover, I shall have to help her cause you trouble.” These words made the immortals laugh still more. Zhang Guo, however, was uneasy about the White Serpent and continued to ask about the outcome. The Immortal Maiden smiled and said, “By right, you should ask your nephew, the immortal. They are kin and should understand better than you or I. But he is very covetous. Now that he has lost power, he speaks only of avenging his mother-in-law, yet he no longer recognizes her. Not recognizing kin, he naturally knows nothing of their success or failure, life or death. I will tell you a general account, lest you, a compassionate immortal, fret on behalf of unrelated persons.”

The Immortal Maiden laughed as she told the assembly: “The White Serpent bore a son. During her confinement, her magical arts were unavailable. Fa Hai, seeing his opportunity, secretly summoned Xu Xian and gave him a golden bowl, instructing that when it shone upon the White Serpent, it would remove the demon and prevent future harm. At this time Xu Xian was still bewitched, his mind unclear. Moreover, having a child, the couple grew closer. Thinking the golden bowl but a small matter, and since his wife was not a demon, he was not afraid and planned to take it upstairs to tease the White Serpent. Unexpectedly, when he reached the upper chamber, the White Serpent was there combing her hair. Xu Xian, walking away with a smile, said, ‘My lady, this monk Fa Hai suddenly came again and gave me this thing.’ Opening the bowl, the mention of Fa Hai startled the White Serpent; turning suddenly, she saw a soul already fled into the bowl, instantly forming a small snake about an inch long, faintly visible therein. Xu Xian was greatly alarmed, and involuntarily threw down the golden bowl and fainted. Fa Hai then came and revived Xu Xian, explained the whole cause, and took him back to the temple to become a monk. It is said he now wanders with his master. As for the White Serpent, she was pressed beneath the Leifeng Pagoda of West Lake, built by King Qian Wusu. The bricks and tiles used were specially made, each embedding a copy of the Diamond Sutra to suppress evil spirits. When the White Serpent entered the base of the pagoda, she was to obey Fa Hai’s orders, join the Zen sect, and study the Buddhist canon with sincerity. According to Fa Hai, she may reform her heart, diligently cultivate, and in time attain the true fruit. Know that the Buddha’s compassion is boundless; although the White Serpent belongs to the demon sect, her conscience is not bad. Thus this present disaster is the foundation for her success. Later her son became a top scholar and was ordered to perform ceremonies at the pagoda, which became a well-known tale. She was also allowed by decree to meet her son outside the pagoda. At that time Fa Hai came riding the clouds to inspect her progress, and was much pleased. Only then did he formally accept her as disciple, prophesying that, thus advancing without slackening, within a thousand years she would attain the true fruit. The year the pagoda falls, that shall be her day of ascension. This is a matter of the future. Since the White Serpent’s heart is kindly and sincere, it seems there is no failure.”

Lü Zu, hearing this, made a brief calculation and smiling nodded, saying, “When this thing succeeds, the emperors of the Central Plains should be extinguished. Even our Daoist sect will undergo some change. The first to be affected will be the Celestial Master Zhang, who too should be deposed at that time.” Zhang Guo then said, “Indeed, some time ago on Mount Longhu, I spoke these words to the Celestial Master. He seemed displeased. But such matters are fixed; how can they be forced otherwise?” Lü Zu said, “Nothing in the world remains unchanged. The Celestial Master is but a mortal man, yet enjoys great authority and no skill, relying solely on a Heaven-bestowed seal to inherit his office, with the rank of Perfected and the post of Celestial Master — this is too easy. How can such matters last forever unchanged?” Before he had finished, Iron Crutch and Zhongli both said, “Heaven’s secrets should not lightly be revealed. We should be cautious in speech.” The two Immortals, hearing this, bowed their heads and said, “What the Master says is right. From now on we should all keep silent and be cautious in words.” Presently, the assembly left Mount Jinshan and went to Gusu. It was heard that the people of Su were most devoted to Lü Zu, and that on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, Lü Zu’s birthday, his temple’s incense was most abundant. At that time, the incense offerings were at their height; men and women gathered in great numbers, the scene lively and joyous. The Eight Immortals all took on the guise of common folk and went to observe.

At the temple, they saw the hall inside and outside, front and back, crowded with people. Men and women, old and young, some praying for children, some for healing, truly very busy. The Eight Immortals casually walked a round. Lü Zu, as host, invited everyone inside to partake of some tea and refreshments. The Immortals all laughed and said, “Just a little, no need for such ceremony. We will look around a bit and come out again.” They saw a man with tear-stained face, holding incense ashes, hastening out of the temple gate; but instead of the main road, he turned toward a deserted path behind the temple. The Eight Immortals said, “This man is so hurried; seeing his noble countenance, he must have great suffering. And holding incense ashes, he must be about to treat someone’s illness. Why not follow and see?”

So the Eight Immortals concealed their forms and quietly followed him to a certain place. The man looked around on all sides, seeing no one coming, then hurriedly pulled up the sleeve of his right arm. With his left hand he took out a sharp blade, bit his teeth, and cried, “Heavenly Lord above, I am Ye Baimin. At home I have only an eighty-year-old father, and I hate that I was born powerless, unable to give him due filial respect, causing his discomfort in daily life and improper care in food and drink. Now he lies sick in bed, at death’s door. As I cannot summon famous doctors nor buy medicine, I have only my sincerity, and so cut my arm to save my father. If Heaven will pity my humble sincerity and protect my father to recover from danger, and grant him one more year of life, I am willing to reduce my own life by one year. I earnestly pray Heaven to pity this.”

After speaking, tears fell like rain. Raising his right hand holding the blade, he cut into his left arm. The Eight Immortals, hearing of this, sighed deeply. Lü Zu, seeing him raise the knife to cut, immediately performed a wondrous method, lightly brushing the arm. Ye Baimin had already cut off a dripping piece of flesh, yet felt no pain. He smiled faintly, spread the incense ashes on the wound, which at once formed a scab. Baimin, amazed, took this as divine aid, knelt down and kowtowed seventeen or eighteen times, then turned back to the main road. The Eight Immortals remained discussing there a while, much praising Ye Baimin’s cutting his arm to save his father. Lü Zu said, “Such deeds, among ordinary men, are called foolish filial piety. But in any case, it is a heart of utmost sincerity, worthy of Heaven’s hearing. I think from now on we should inform the local earth gods: when such filial sons are encountered, we must give them this method of pain relief and preventing decay, immediately treating them to spare their suffering. What say you all?” At these words, all joyfully approved. From then on, Lü Zu and the other immortals, wherever they went, transmitted this method to the local earth gods, the local deities of day and night, the officials on duty, and the household Taoist gods.

All paid heed to learn. So it is said that now those who cut flesh to save their parents suffer not great pain, nor does the wound rot. It is not that the skin or flesh differ, but that Lü Zu taught the method to the earth gods and other immortals. The gods with their close eyes and ears may secretly adjust and protect at any time and place.

Whether Ye Baimin’s father was healed remains to be seen in the next chapter.
