# Chapter 099: The Pressing of the Immortals at Suzhou, a Fair Tale — The Bridge of Looking to the Immortals Adds Glory to Xi Zi

Now it chanced that Ye Baimin returned home, and mixed the remaining incense ashes with flesh from his arm, preparing a decoction for his father to drink. Meanwhile, the Eight Immortals had followed close behind. On the one hand, they summoned the local earth deity, and the night-roaming spirits, to instruct in the method to staunch pain and prevent corruption; on the other hand, they inquired into Ye Baimin’s daily conduct. They found him to be a poor and destitute scholar of medicine, possessed of a blunt nature; after twenty years of study, he was still unable to write even ordinary characters properly. Half of this was due to the hardships at home; of the twenty years, fully two-thirds were spent in diagnosing diseases, gaining only meagre profits used in filial devotion to his parents. Now he was over forty years old and had never taken a wife. He had no thought for such matters, but only toiled earnestly and punctiliously, living by rule and custom, and showing dutiful filial piety.

But his mother had died two years earlier, and he had mortgaged his own person to a medicine shop, displaying a hanging board to see patients. It was agreed that for three years, the fees earned should all go to the shop, and only then had he borrowed fifty taels of silver to complete the funeral. Fortunately, the shopkeeper took pity on him as a dutiful son, and still gave him a small wage yearly. Not a single coin was spared for his own use, all given to his father’s delicacies. Unexpectedly, his father recently fell ill again, with no hope of recovery; therefore he ran to the Lüzu (Master Lü) temple to obtain some incense ashes, and cut his arm to save his father. It happened that the Eight Immortals encountered him then. Lüzu tended his knife wound, then sent him home, sprinkling some magic water on his father’s face, and the malady was immediately cured. Seeing him so poor and humble, Lüzu said to the Immortals: “This man is so filial, yet so poor; I pity him greatly.” The Fairy of the Lady smiled and said: “People worship you thus, and you do not devise some method for them; can you still be called a Daoist immortal?” Lüzu laughed: “Is that not easy? You sit in the temple; I will attend to him by a method of gaining wealth.” So he transformed into a beggar, and went to the Ye household to beg. The Ye family dwelling was small; the talk inside could be heard outside.

Lüzu shouted aloud and listened quietly within. An old voice was heard saying: “Son, by the grace of the immortal lord, by chance my illness is cured. Know that all the days and months to come are gifts from the immortal lord. You must strive to be a good man, to do good deeds. Though our family is poor, the poor in the world are countless. We think ourselves most miserable; how can we know that there are those more miserable than we? Listen, outside there is a beggar asking alms; that man is even worse off than we. You may give him the cold rice I just finished, and some salty vegetables and fresh meat, all bought this morning; give it all to him.” Another voice replied: “Father, rest assured, I will attend to him well.” Thereupon a middle-aged man came forth. Lüzu recognized him as the man who cut his arm yesterday. He immediately advanced, lamenting and begging. Baimin sighed and said: “Brother, you are a man of noble bearing, yet poorer than we, a father and son. This is indeed pitiable. Wait a moment, I will go to the kitchen and see about preparing some food to relieve your hunger.” Lüzu thanked him.

Baimin soon returned, carrying two bowls of rice, two pieces of meat, and a dish of salted vegetables, which he placed in the middle hall, saying: “Brother, come. This house has only these two bowls of rice left; we shall each eat one.” Lüzu went in boldly and sat opposite him. Seeing only two pieces of meat no larger than dried bean curd, he frowned and said: “I cannot believe your household is so frugal; why is there only this little meat? Honestly, these two small pieces, even if given wholly to me, are not enough to moisten my parched entrails.” Baimin was struck dumb and said: “Brother, how can you say this? We are both in poverty, so I dared to invite you to share these scraps and leftovers. If what you say is so, would you not be like a pampered son? Do not say I would not presume to invite you; but how could you endure the life of a mendicant?”

Lüzu angrily said: “You are unreasonable; I am your guest in your home. Even if you find it difficult, you should think of some way to prepare a few dishes for us to share, so that it may have meaning. Besides, you have a pot of meat and a jar of fine white rice in your house. Why do you not bring them out, and speak such words to me? Is this the way to treat a guest?” Baimin was greatly astonished and said: “Brother, how funny your words are! I am so poor that I cannot even afford ordinary vegetables; this pork was bought with money obtained by pawning a small coat, because my father, recovering from illness, cannot bear vegetables. I bought 200 cash worth of meat, cooked to open his appetite. Where is any pot of meat? As for rice, if any, only a sheng or so, to be kept for tonight and tomorrow morning. This is the only cooked rice we have. Where is a whole jar of rice? Brother, do you speak thus only to tease me?”

Lüzu laughed heartily: “Very well, then lead me to the kitchen, and see if my words wrong you.” Baimin, somewhat displeased, took hold of his sleeve and led him to the kitchen. Lo, a strange sight. Upon entering, a savoury smell of meat struck their nostrils. Lifting the pot’s lid, there was a large pig’s trotter, cooked so tender as to be fit to eat. Lüzu then lifted the rice jar’s lid, and found it filled with steaming hot rice. This made Baimin dumbfounded. Lüzu pointed at him with a cold smile: “How now? Am I not wrong in my words? Yet you still say you care for us poor folk! But in truth you have been feigning poverty before me.”

At once Baimin’s mind was enlightened; he fell prostrate before Lüzu, saying: “Brother, surely you are a celestial immortal, moved by pity for this poor disciple, come specially to aid me and my father. I beseech you, great immortal, show mercy and speedily give your aid.” Lüzu laughed aloud: “You are not only a miser, but a fool also; no wonder you are thus poor. When have you ever seen any immortal in this world? If truly an immortal, why would he come without cause to a poor man’s house? Does he desire your incense offerings?” Saying this, he strode to the middle hall, slapped the table, and called for the meat to be quickly brought for all to enjoy. Baimin set the meat from the pot on a large plate, and exchanged the rice for hot rice. Yet to his disbelief, the meat in the pot and the rice in the jar remained as full as before, not diminished in the least. Baimin was more fully convinced that Lüzu was indeed an immortal.

The people of Suzhou most believed in Lüzu. Moreover, having just come from the Lüzu temple yesterday, it was all the easier to think it was Lüzu himself. Baimin then suspected that this immortal might be the incarnation of Lüzu, come to test his heart and deeds. Trembling, he set the meat and rice before Lüzu, and respectfully said: “Great immortal, please partake.” He himself knelt on the ground and served him rice. Lüzu paid him no heed, eating bowl after bowl; he ate more than twenty bowls. Baimin replenished his rice more than twenty times, and served meat five or six times. Lüzu laughed: “You foolish host, now you begin to understand some rules of hospitality. I have eaten so much rice and meat; do you not feel pain?” Baimin made no reply, but bowed low, begging for aid. Lüzu ignored him, eating and eating until he had consumed some thirty bowls. Then he rose, stretched lazily, rubbed his belly, looked up to heaven, and laughed aloud, saying: “Well, now this is something. Host, you too shall eat a bowl. Pardon my laziness; I must rest awhile.”

Having said this, he bowed his head on the table, and soon snored thunderously, sleeping soundly. Baimin dared not go away, but remained devoutly prostrate on the floor. Presently his father, not seeing his son, came out leaning on his staff. Seeing Baimin kneeling before the beggar, he was greatly astonished. Baimin quickly said: “This is surely Lü Chunyang, the master Lü.” His father, hearing this, asked no more, but fell down straight beside his son. Lüzu awoke and saw the two kneeling by his side, and laughed heartily: “You father and son have come to ask me for alms. Speak plainly; why this affectation?” The two quickly said: “We beseech the great immortal’s protection, and the master’s blessing.” Lüzu called them twice to rise, but they kept kneeling, till he was greatly angered: “Where in the world have you such fools? Kneeling so long, do you not begrudge me eating your meat and rice? Then I shall return it to you.”

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly spat forth a foul matter, covering the floor and the two kneeling men, even their heads and clothes. Hastily raising his eyes, the beggar was no longer to be seen; only a fragrant odour remained, intoxicating the senses. This was what he had spat forth. The father and son rose, bowing their heads. Baimin reported all to his father. The two sighed that they had no fate with immortals, and lamented together. They swept away the foul matter and cast it onto the courtyard soil. Unexpectedly, in a twinkling, a fragrant herb sprouted from the earth, filling the whole house with sweet fragrance, penetrating the senses and every joint, instantly bringing comfort and strengthening spirit tenfold. Baimin’s father’s white hair turned black, his eyes and ears became clear, and he moved swiftly. Baimin himself felt his spirit purified, body and mind joyful.

The tale spread, and within several hundred li, the sick came to Baimin for diagnosis. His spirit was now greatly enlightened, his mind clear and nimble; his pulse diagnoses all fitted the maladies. In every medicine he dispensed, he included a pinch of fragrant herb, which truly cured the diseases. In a moment, Ye Baimin gained fame as a divine doctor, renowned far and wide. Within three years, he became greatly wealthy. Thus all said: Lüzu now dwells in Suzhou; whosoever meets him surely gains wealth and blessing.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, all dressed anew and went to the Lüzu temple to burn incense. The place was small and the crowd large; the pressing was incomprehensible. The country folk, by hearsay, called the event “the pressing of the immortals.” It was said that this day was Lüzu’s birthday, and each year he saved one person, who thereby gained blessing or profit. Lüzu himself pressed among the crowd; if he met a destined person and pressed close to him, he would find satisfaction and both wealth and honour. More laughable still was the rumour, arising from the resemblance of Ye family’s immortal herb to the evergreen, that on the night before Lüzu’s birthday, ignorant folk would place leaves of the evergreen at their door, hoping to grow immortal herbs like Ye’s. This false report was widely known. Yet they never considered that Lüzu’s protection of Ye Baimin was because of his devout filial piety. Now these people set aside this main cause, seeking only material reward and blessing; this is truly to lose the root while pursuing the branch. No silliness in the world is greater than this.

Putting aside these idle words, there is another similar matter also in Suzhou city. This occurred not many years after Lüzu saved the Ye family. At that time, in Suzhou, there was a shop dealing in pickled meats and ducks, surnamed Lu, nicknamed Lu the Good. Because he never spared the profits he earned yearly, but gave them all to the poor, he had acquired a good name. That winter, the harvest was poor in the countryside, and the poor became more numerous. Hearing of Lu’s generosity, the poor came, supporting the aged and carrying the young, seeking alms. But this shop was small, and due to the poor year, the middle and lower classes all practiced thrift, so business was slack, and Lu found it hard to sustain himself, no surplus for charity. But since the poor came attracted by his virtue, and he could not refuse, he sold several thin acres and a house inherited from his ancestors to raise funds to give. Yet the proceeds were limited, and the supplicants increased daily. In no time, he had spent all he had. Some came from afar, and, receiving no help, could not return. Lu could only sigh and weep before them.

One night, a beggar, covered with rotten sores and near death, came to his door and lay down, unable to move. When spoken to, he could only mutter incoherently, occasionally pointing to his belly to show his extreme hunger. Seeing his pitiable state and the threatening snow, Lu said to a servant: “This man is so miserable; if the wind and snow strike again tonight, he will surely die before morning from hunger and cold. Though I am poor in the countryside, I cannot see death unaverted. Help him into the kitchen to rest and warm himself. Give him hot tea and hot rice. Tomorrow, please call Mr. Ye across the street to see him, give him medicine, and cure him; that too will be a good deed.”

The Mr. Ye he spoke of was indeed Ye Baimin, now of some renown. All who came to him were cured. Knowing he owed his success to the immortal’s aid, he took no fees from the poor, and even paid for their medicines himself. Later, he opened an herbal medicine shop by the door, not seeking profit but virtue. Yet at year’s end, his accounts always showed profit. The shop was newly opened then; Lu and he were good friends, hence these words.

But the servant disliked the beggar’s filth and would not help him. Lu had no choice but to assist him in himself. Yet on lifting him, a strange thing happened. Lu’s nose was filled with a fragrant odour emanating from the beggar, penetrating to his bones, making his whole body feel comfortable. Lu was bent on kindness, planning how to send away the many poor and how to cure this beggar; his heart was so troubled he did not notice this.

The beggar stayed several days, and Ye Baimin was called to diagnose and prescribe. After about ten days, he recovered spirit and departed, bowing thanks. Before leaving he said: “I owe you, sir, my life’s restoration and have no recompense but one word: all that I have used and left behind, you must treasure. Your future wealth and promotion are all contained herein.” Saying this, he limped and hobbled away.

Later, the servant reported: “This beggar is no human. The master treated him thus; before he left, he did not tidy the ragged mat and quilt he lay on; he fouled the kitchen floor with much filth; his quilt was full of sores and scabs. Such an abominable man should have died outside long ago; why save him?” This warning made Lu forbid touching the beggar’s things. He went to see for himself, and found the mat and quilt in disorder, with much filth and sores. Lu thought: This beggar’s behaviour is indeed strange. Looking down, a strange thing appeared; fragrant odour rose from the bedding, and the filth and scabs shone brightly. Knowing this was no common matter, he touched them; they were as hard as iron and cold as ice.

Upon further examination, the filth had turned to gold, and the scabs into gold. Then he knew the beggar was an immortal in disguise, come to bestow blessing upon him. Lu immediately became rich. He burned the ragged mat to cook meat; the meat emitted a strange fragrance whenever a single blade of grass was added. Thus Lu’s pickled meats became famous. All knew they were cooked with the immortal’s mat, hence the unusual aroma. The name Lu Gaoyian (Lu the Pickled Meat) became famous throughout the land, as did Ye Baimin the physician. Lu’s descendants prospered for generations. As for the mat and quilt, Ye Baimin said they had the same virtue as the immortal herb. Whatever grave illness, a piece an inch square, decocted, would instantly remove the root of disease. Lu, now wealthy, ceased this business, cutting the quilt into countless squares. Within years, many patients were saved. Later, a prince’s beloved concubine could not give birth; all physicians were at a loss. It was said that Lu’s shop had such immortal treasures; some was taken and taken in insufficient quantity. When swallowed, she immediately gave birth safely. The prince was overjoyed, reported to the emperor, and was specially rewarded, fulfilling the prophecy of immortals granting promotion and wealth. This immortal, Lu said, he suspected was Lüzu, and went to Lüzu temple to offer incense in thanks. Lüzu showed him it was the Iron Crutch Li. Hence Lu’s family worshiped the Daoist master Li in perpetuity. This is but a brief account.

Meanwhile, the Eight Immortals, having lingered long in Suzhou, journeyed on to Hangzhou. They spent several days on City God Hill. The West Lake was no longer the wild growth of old; the Su and Bai dikes stretched across the lake, six bridges and three bamboo groves, pagodas and peaks, natural and artificial combined, truly the finest scenery under heaven. The Immortals lingered long, reluctant to depart. Hearing that at the Yongjin Gate below City God Hill was a noodle shop, with a servant honest and kind, having no family and never married, and yearly gave his wages to the poor. Another virtue was that he never threw away leftover food, but cleaned and gave it to beggars; what could not be given away was eaten by himself. Hence he was called a man of accumulated virtue. Lüzu heard this and thought: “This man has some simple-heartedness; if there be fate with immortals, I might save him.” So he transformed into a poor Taoist, and went to beg some scraps of food. The man gave him a large bowl of leftover noodles. Lüzu took it, found the taste poor, and after eating and spitting it out with a clatter, returned it, saying: “Your noodles are not good to eat; I cannot accept your kindness; I return it to you.” The man laughed and took it back without anger.

Finding it too dirty, he could not eat it; just then a mangy dog ran in, licking and snapping, seeking food. The man gave the noodles to it. The moment the noodles entered the dog’s belly, the dog ascended to heaven, transforming into a golden dragon, flying off with head and tail wagging. The man realized he had seen an immortal, and hurried to find the Taoist, but he was long gone. The man developed a mental illness, gave up business, and daily stood on the small bridge before his door, gazing upwards, hoping the immortal would return. He waited years without sight of an immortal, grew madder, and fell into the water to die. After death, Lüzu saved him as a ghost-immortal.

This was because he had no fate with immortals in life, but only the blessing of becoming a ghost-immortal after death. As for the mangy dog, it was the dog that Lüzu had harmed in his youth, now receiving his grace and releasing its grievance of a lifetime. This had been told before. The reader may recall that after the servant’s death, because he died looking to the immortals, the bridge was named the Bridge of Looking to the Immortals.

Again, the Eight Immortals roamed the mortal world; over a hundred years later, it was the day of the Queen Mother’s Longevity. The Eight Immortals gathered to offer congratulations, agreeing to cross the sea together. One day, upon the Eastern Sea, Lan Caihe carelessly dropped a white jade flower basket into the water. The Dragon King and his consort were in the palace, discussing sea affairs with officials. Suddenly a white light shone throughout the palace.

The Dragon King’s grandsons, Mo Ang and Mo Run, young and curious, brought several Yaksha to patrol, and saw the white jade flower basket. The two were greatly pleased and sought to take it to the palace. Meanwhile, Lan Caihe and the Fairy of the Lady entered the sea in pursuit, and upon seeing the two Mo, demanded the basket’s return. The two grew angry: “This was picked up by my brother; how can you prove it yours?” Words passed to blows. The two Mo, unknowing of their danger, led the Yaksha in battle. The two Immortals drew swords to resist. Could the two Mo withstand the Immortals’ power? In a few moves, both fell dead by the Immortals’ swords.

How this matter was settled is not yet known, but will be revealed in the next chapter.
