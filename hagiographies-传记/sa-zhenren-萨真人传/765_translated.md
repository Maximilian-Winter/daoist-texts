# Chapter Two: Master Sa Enters the Yamen as an Official — Master Sa, a Physician, Errs in the Prescription

Now it is related that the former incarnation of Master Sa, having cultivated through two generations, followed thence the soul-guide boy to come forth in Xihe County of Shu. At that time there was a man named Ru Wang of the Sa family, whose wife was Lady Cao. The couple had sown many good roots, yet at the age of thirty had no child. Lady Cao was deeply sorrowful for three years, when suddenly one day she found herself with child. As she lay with her husband in the daytime, she dreamed that a flying phoenix alighted upon her body, and she beheld:

Nine calyxes rare and noble, five colours splendid and bright.  
The nine calyxes, noble and rare, drink in the spirit and purity of Heaven and Earth; the five colours, splendid and bright, shine forth the literary elegance of Heaven and Earth. Lofty like the auspicious signs in the court of Yu, faintly resembling the portent of Mount Qi.  
It is said that the phoenix will not alight on the parasol tree, nor eat the bamboo fruit; now behold it entering the strange dream to gather, and at the appointed time to soar.  
O phoenix, O phoenix, surveying virtue’s splendour, it descends; O phoenix, O phoenix, spreading wings, it soars on high.

This phoenix is the augury of the Sa lineage’s immortal scion; it is not the pleasure-seeker riding in pleasure-houses, nor the gallant of the Qin towers.

Having dreamed this phoenix, Lady Cao told her husband Ru Wang thereof. Ru Wang also said, "I too have had some dreams; this surely portends a good son." When the tenth month approached, behold, great Du Zhong and little Ren Shen, Master Sa’s wife ordered Liu Ji Nu to take Aconite and suspend it, and in front of the incense to lay down kelp, softening the maternal skin gently, when suddenly Mai Men Dong opened wide. In a moment was born a child like clove-seed. Ru Wang and his wife were overwhelmed with joy, and named him Shoujian.

Behold the child’s birth: wise in heaven’s gifts, eminent and precocious. When a boy, he was skilled in reading; the books he read filled his belly, ten thousand scrolls at a glance, ten lines at a time. He was also skilled in writing; the characters he wrote were iron strokes and silver hooks, in the shapes of coiled dragons and crouching tigers. He was also skilled in chanting poetry; the verses he chanted coughed and spat into the nine heavens, pearls and jade arising with the wind. He was also skilled in composition; the essays he composed were like a hundred hu of dragon script in a cauldron, his pen’s power able to bear them alone.

Master Sa thus possessed such learning, clearly a divine child. All men said, "Taking official rank is like picking weeds from the ground; passing the examinations is as easy as plucking hairs from the forehead." Yet little did they know that Yama sought to test his precepts, bringing many changes. Alas, when but nine years of age, his father first passed away, then his mother followed; poor Master Sa was left without father or support, without mother or reliance, lonely and forlorn, like a fledgling crow abandoned by its mother, chirping feebly and pitiably!

As he grew older, his clothing and food were scant. Suddenly the magistrate issued a decree, commanding the elders of each county to select promising youths to serve as agricultural officials. The elders of Xihe County nominated Master Sa. He sought to decline, but could not, and so took his place in the county office. Though Master Sa was a man of benevolence, the service was no light matter. Whether in the civil office managing documents, or in the rites office overseeing sacrifices and the reception and dispatch of officials, or in the household office supervising revenues, or in the works office managing craftsmen and constructions, or in the military office controlling soldiers — yet he was assigned to the very prison office. Once entered, crimes were brought in and sent out; he was forced to use cunning devices and wield pen and sword.

One day, a man entered the stable at night and stole a fine horse. At that time the new rain had just ceased. The horse’s owner on the next morning followed the traces some twenty li or more, and found it at a man’s house; he immediately informed the authorities, and the matter was brought before the magistrate. All men said this horse thief was plainly a common criminal. The horse thief claimed that the runaway horse was taken in by him, which was true. The magistrate commanded the prison officer to investigate. The thief was forced to implore Master Sa to clear his guilt. Master Sa defended him, drawing up a memorial: "Since there is a method of horse theft, is there not also a means to conceal the horse? This horse may have run away, and it is true that it was taken in by a certain person." With these few words he declared the horse thief clean and innocent. The magistrate then reversed the case upon the horse owner. What is meant by "reversing the case"? When the complainant is found guilty and the accused is cleared.

Again, there was a man who had a boat left unattended, and it was stolen by a man who poled it downriver and remodeled it into a new craft. Just as the boat was being dismantled, it was found by the owner, who reported to the authorities: "At the third watch of night, this man came, beating gongs and drums, and seized a passenger vessel; he scattered the cargo, then took the boards to remake the vessel." The magistrate accepted the case, and adjudged: "Certain one seized the cargo, but did not kill or injure any person; reduce one degree of penalty and sentence to military service in lieu of death." The man was forced to implore Master Sa to absolve his military penalty. Master Sa defended him, reporting to the magistrate: "Since the passenger vessel bore cargo, is it likely there were not two or three keeping watch? That night, with gongs and drums, if men escaped, they would have called on the shore residents to rescue; if men did not escape, they would have been slain by thieves. Now only the seizing of the vessel and scattering of cargo is reported, without mention of persons aboard; this is an empty vessel indeed. To treat an empty vessel as a cargo ship, and to take it downstream as theft, this is an unreasonable accusation." Mark you, Master Sa, by this few words, caused the magistrate plainly to absolve the man, and reversed the accusation upon the complainant, sentencing him to military service. This matter is not spoken of further here.

Yet again a man and a woman had kept company for three years in deep affection. Afterwards the man took up with another woman; the new passion was close, and the old love grew distant. The former woman was resentful, frequently obstructing the man, forbidding him to go to the new woman’s house. Know then that love in excess becomes hate; affection in excess becomes enmity. The woman said one word to the man; the man said one word to the woman. The man cursed the woman; the woman cursed the man. The man could bear it no longer; anger sprang from his heart, hatred rose to his gall, and with merciless fists and cruel kicks he pushed the woman to the ground, struck her with dozens of blows, kicked her with dozens of toes, and beat her to death. This is truly:

A foolish woman and a faithless man, former love turned to hatred.

The woman’s husband came home from abroad, and saw his wife beaten to death, saying, "This is no stranger, but the adulterer who killed her." He thus lodged a complaint with the authorities. At that time the neighbours also testified, saying that on the day of her death the adulterer indeed came from her house. The magistrate determined to sentence the man to death. The man implored Master Sa to save him from death. Master Sa then submitted to the magistrate a memorial, saying: "This man had good relations with the woman, close as a bond at the breast; surely he would not have used fists and feet against her. If he had a gentle manner, there would be no such cruel overturning of heaven and earth. The woman’s life was not ended by an adulterer, but by a lover who was not adulterous, who beat her when she would not comply." The magistrate, upon seeing this memorial, pardoned the man from death, and charged only adultery; turning against the woman's husband for false accusation, he questioned him, "Is it not fitting to add the crime of procuring adultery?" This was indeed the place where Master Sa wielded pen and sword.

Suddenly one day there came news that a conscript had died at a post station, another at a border garrison, and the husband of the adulteress had died of fury. Master Sa then greatly awakened, saying, "I have saved one life and condemned another; to give life here and take life there, what heart is this?" He then took pretext of "being sent to the countryside to pacify the place," and abandoned his pen and sword honours, fleeing to a distant town, never daring to return.

Master Sa, no longer an official, thought, "The way of medicine is indeed a benevolent art," and so purchased the Divine Farmer’s Herbal, Wang Shuhe’s Pulse Classic, and Sun Zhenren’s Post-Arm Prescriptions, and thoroughly read them all. Thereupon, he assumed the appearance of a physician, and beheld himself thus:

The art handed down by Xuanqi, born from the heart of Heaven and Earth;  
To examine one disease's root, one must observe, listen, inquire, and feel the pulse;  
Diagnose the three parts’ subtle pulses, discerning emptiness, fullness, floating, and sinking.  
To expel chronic illness and revive the paralytic, one must know how to use wondrous prescriptions;  
To restore life from death, one must think how to employ magical moxibustion and divine needles.  
Loving Su Danquan’s clear streams in the orange wells, admiring Dong Feng’s flowers blooming red in the apricot groves.  
When illness is met, one thinks of relieving the people and benefiting creatures;  
When dispensing medicine, one aims to supplement Yang and nourish Yin.  
Desiring to pass on the healing art to the nation, his heart is full of living compassion.

Master Sa thus pursued medicine with benevolence overflowing, his miraculous medicines like spirits. He cured several mute to speak, several blind to see again, several hunchbacked to straighten their backs, several lame to walk upright, several with five wounds and seven diseases, several with paralysis left or right, several with obstructed urination or defecation, several with heart qi and stomach qi pain without ceasing, several with carbuncles before and behind, several with falling left or right kidneys and bladder. Master Sa’s medical skill was so exalted that all men envied him, saying, "This physician is indeed a reincarnation of Bian Que, a reappearance of Duke Lu." Yet know this:

The fool may hit on a truth in a thousand thoughts; the wise may err in a thousand thoughts.

One day, a man was ill of great weakness and burning heat throughout the body. This could only be remedied by a single dose of the Ten-Complete Great Tonic Decoction, but he obstinately took a purgative, which quickly caused death. Another woman suffered postpartum fever, clearly obstruction of blood stagnation; removing the stagnated blood would naturally cure her, but he obstinately gave a great tonic, which restrained the stagnation, and the woman died. Again, a child had lost speech after convulsions, clearly a condition of weakness needing tonics. Master Sa said, "The phlegm confuses the orifices of the heart; clearing it will cure," and prescribed a dose of purgative niter and sulfur; the child died immediately. Master Sa thus lost three lives by error, beating his breast and lamenting, looking upwards and sighing: "How difficult is the Way of Medicine, even so!" He then said, "It is only by breaking one’s arm thrice that one becomes a good physician; I have not learned this medicine by breaking my arm." He further said, "A physician does not prescribe his medicine before the third generation; I have not learned this medicine by family tradition." He then threw his medicine pouch into the waves, and committed his medical books to the fire, lamenting and chastising himself, and composed a poem saying:

The business of life is clumsy like a dove,  
As official and physician both I fail.  
Official I am not upright but crafty,  
Physician I know not the light from the dark.  
Prescriptions given wrongly as poisoned wine,  
Pen and sword dancing sharper than spearheads.  
Most bitter is the wounding of living souls,  
A single thought of regret, a single pang of sorrow.

Master Sa thus was filled with remorse, saying, "What profession shall I now review to cover my former faults?" Thereafter he thought: the cultivators of the Way are rooted in compassion, and their gate is convenience. Surely it is better to become a recluse and cultivate the Way, to repent past errors, and thus be free from the sufferings of transmigration.

Master Sa held this one thought; this was the very root of his becoming immortal. Let us see what follows.
