# Chapter the Third: Sa Jun Cultivates the Way with Sincere Heart; Three Immortals Confer upon Him the Mastery of Arts

It is said that Sa Jun, having abandoned the art of medicine, became a Taoist. Upon his head he wore a Taoist kerchief; upon his body he donned a tattered robe; about his waist he bound a hempen cord; and on his feet he wore a pair of straw sandals. Once he entered the mysterious gateway, he at once comprehended some immortal secrets, seeing that all men’s lives are but entangled and harmed by this skin-bag. What is this skin-bag? It is the fleshly body. Men, being bound to this casing, become sluggish in the sea of desire, and drift in the rivers of love. Is this not entanglement and injury? Sa Jun therefore composed a song, the "True Words Lamenting the Skin-bag," which runs thus:

This skin-bag, how obstructive it is, a bane to my spirit-seat! Following step by step, contriving schemes, left and right it makes me unfree.  
The sinews a tangle, the flesh a mass, binding the hundred bones into the four elements. Hunger there is, thirst there is, poverty likewise; sickness, disaster, and decay.  
Begging for food, needing clothes to cover; yet more, craving the splendour and greed of the world. My heart finds no leisure, thus I begin to incur debts of life.  
Upon close thought, indeed hard to bear, inviting legions of demons hard to forbid. They breed the Five Ghosts and the Three Corpses, nourish the Eight Evils and the Six Harms.  
Excrement and urine, body and marrow congeal; what charm or elegance is to be seen? The nine orifices all unclean pits, the six gates full of filthy disorder.  
Fallen into the Three Paths, sunk in the Six Realms, all because the skin-bag commands me thus. Now knowing thee to be my enemy, therefore I teach myself to loathe it.  
I seek the enlightened master, ask for the convenient path, only by the method can I return to myself. Only because life arises from desire; the heart of desire, countless, with no coming or going.  
To sever the desire-heart, one must be firm; cease to cherish the skin-bag and lose not the way. Plain food and coarse tea suffice for the time; else again arises greed and jealousy.  
Master, do not delight or look back; know the profound mystery within. Hidden inside is a great divine pearl, by day and night its brightness ever shines forth.  
Neither bound by words nor difficult to express; ears cannot hear it, eyes cannot behold it. Neither empty nor existent, neither midway; bright and shining, without fixed measure.  
To nourish the skin-bag, one must be pure in diet; from purity arises understanding and enlightenment. Suddenly, the heart is enlightened and clear; the skin-bag transforms into a treasury of luminous pearls.  
Sending forth light, pervading the Dharma realm; within and without communicating without hindrance. Illuminating the dignified transcendent man, complete and adorned with spiritual powers.  
There is no sin, no merit, no heaven nor hell. Once freed from the skin-bag, one is free to roam without restraint.  
Neither coming nor going; between coming and going no fixed abode. Vast and mighty, shining through the void of heaven, who can again seek the place of Buddhahood?

Having ended the "True Words Lamenting the Skin-bag," Sa Jun reflected further that the human heart is unfathomable; when restless it persists, when abandoned it perishes; its coming and going have no fixed time, and none know whence it hails. Thus from his mouth he again recited the ever-unceasing "Heart Sutra," saying:

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, whilst practicing deep Prajñāpāramitā, clearly saw that the five aggregates are empty; Śāriputra, form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form; form is indeed emptiness, emptiness indeed form. So too are sensation, conception, volition, and consciousness. Śāriputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness; they neither arise nor cease, are neither defiled nor pure, neither increase nor decrease. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, conception, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or object of mind; no realm of sight, and so forth, to no realm of consciousness; no ignorance and also no extinction of ignorance, and so forth to no old age and death and no extinction of old age and death; no suffering, cause, cessation, or path; no knowledge, no attainment, and no non-attainment. Therefore, Bodhisattvas rely on Prajñāpāramitā and have no obstructions of mind; having no obstructions, they have no fear of death. They pass far beyond inverted views and attain ultimate Nirvāṇa. All Buddhas of the three times, relying on Prajñāpāramitā, attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.  
He then recited the mantra: Gate Gate Pāragate Pārasaṃgate Bodhi Svāhā.

It is told that Sa Jun, diligently cultivating, also held that all the manifold dharmas return to one; without a master, who might transmit? At this time he heard that in Jiangxi Guangxin Prefecture there was a Master Zhang Xujing; in Jiangxi Jianchang Prefecture, a Master Wang Fangping; and in Jiangxi Jiujiang Prefecture, a Master Ge Xianweng. These three were all of profound Taoist skill. Sa Jun resolved to travel down from Shu, first reaching Jiujiang to pay respects to Master Ge Xianweng; then from Jiujiang to Guangxin to pay respects to Zhang Xujing; and from Guangxin to Jianchang to pay respects to Wang Fangping. He would take these three as masters, and prostrate himself to their wondrous Way.

It was the season of peach blossoms and green willows. Having passed the eighteen caves of Jiuxi, and the twelve peaks of Wushan, bearing some scattered rice and millet, he came straight to the mountain where the dragon, tiger, wind, and cloud meet, intending to learn the art of fire-refining the elixir. He travelled by day and lodged by night, striding onward swiftly. He crossed many spring floods and countless sunsets over mountains beyond mountains, until he emerged from a gorge-mouth. His spirit weary and tired, he rested a while in a pavilion. Suddenly three Taoists appeared, one called "Master Jing," another "Master Ping," and the third "Master Weng." These three were none other than Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng themselves. Seeing Sa Jun’s sincere yearning for the Way, and his distant journey to pay respects, they conferred among themselves and resolved to impart to him their wondrous methods there in the midway, just at the pavilion at the gorge-mouth.

Sa Jun, beholding these three venerable Taoists, radiant with immortal bearing, graceful and detached from the world, immediately rose and said, "Respected Masters, this poor Taoist bows low." The three Taoists quickly replied, "Master, pray do not take offence." Sa Jun then inquired, "Pray, what are your honored surnames and names? From what region do you hail?" Zhang Xujing said, "I am Master Jing." Wang Fangping said, "I am Master Ping." Ge Xianweng said, "I am Master Weng. We are all natives of Jiangxi." Master Jing then asked Sa Jun, "Master, your honored surname and name? From what place do you come?" Sa Jun said, "This poor Taoist is from Xihe in Shu Commandery; my surname is Sa, my name Shoujian." Master Jing asked, "Master, now that you have come, whither do you intend to go?" Sa Jun replied, "I intend to go to the land of Jiangxi, to pay respects to Masters Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng, and to prostrate myself to their Taoist arts." Master Jing said, "Xujing, my Taoist friend, has already passed away."

Sa Jun was startled, and asked, "If Master Xujing is dead, is Master Wang Fangping still living?" Master Ping said, "I am from Jianchang, neighbour to Wang Fangping. Now Master Fangping is also dead." Sa Jun was again startled, and asked, "If Masters Zhang and Wang are both dead, is Master Ge still living?" Master Weng said, "Ge Xianweng was also my Taoist friend, but he too has been dead many years."

Hearing that all three masters were dead, Sa Jun looked up to Heaven and sighed, saying, "I have no fate to have come here." Tears then fell uncontrollably. Master Jing said, "Master, do not grieve. Though Xujing is dead, his son now succeeds to the office of Celestial Master, and his Taoist arts remain profound. I have old ties with him, and now hold a letter, which I was about to entrust to someone; it is better now to entrust it to you. Go to pay respects to him; he will surely transmit the Taoist arts to you." Then he took from his sleeve a sheet of writing and gave it to Sa Jun. Sa Jun received it and asked, "How far is the road from here to Xinzhou in Jiangxi?" Master Ping said, "Cloudy mountains rise in layer upon layer, and the river flows vast and broad; it is very far, very far." Master Weng said, "Master, on your journey you will need much provision; I will teach you the spell of the jujube." Sa Jun asked, "What is this spell of the jujube?" Master Weng said, "Only by reciting the spell will the jujubes grow large, some as big as pears. Each day recite the spell nine times; eat three jujubes at a time, and you will be full for a day, needing no other food or fire-cooked meal." He then taught him the secret words, instructing Sa Jun to recite thus: "Sheep horn, sheep horn; deer Lu, deer Lu; Yan he, mou ni ba fu hong." Sa Jun followed the instructions, and indeed found that jujubes silently appeared in his sleeve. These jujubes were described thus:

Bright and pure as white blossoms, tall and red as vermilion.  
Crisp as candy, sweet as honey.  
Firm as Han Yan’s golden pellets, sweet as the red duckweed fruit of Chu.  
Filial as Zeng Shen in thought of parents, honest as Wang Ji who left his wife.  
Graceful as Man Qian skilled in guessing arrows, steadfast as Xiao Rou repaying loyalty with devotion.

Sa Jun, having received the spell of the jujube, bowed deeply in thanks to Master Weng without cease. Master Ping said, "Since Master Weng has already taught you the spell of the jujube, I have nothing else to teach. But I do have a palm-leaf fan which can cure sickness. One wave of the fan drives away heat; two waves bring forth coolness; three waves make the flesh and bones tremble, and the sickness is cured at once. Moreover, this fan can restore the souls of those who have died suddenly; if a person dies violently but has not yet passed the sixtieth year, and has a few talismans attached to his body, by waving this fan the person will live again. Hence it is called the Fan that Returns the Soul." Sa Jun asked, "How can this palm-leaf fan have such wondrous power?" Master Ping said, "This palm leaf is not born of common places, but grows upon a stone cliff of Mount Sumeru, enduring thousands of kalpas. It has drunk countless dews of Heaven, weathered many frosts of the cold season, and is of pure Yin essence, a treasure of Heaven and Earth. My master, Master Xu Wu, gathered it and made the fan; thus it has such wondrous powers. I now transmit it to you." He then taught Sa Jun two Taoist talismans. Sa Jun bowed and received them, filled with deep gratitude.

Master Jing said, "The three of us have met with Sa Jun; two masters have imparted their arts; I too have my own methods to reveal." He then taught Sa Jun the "Great Art of the Five Thunders," instructing him to have the spirit within his heart, to expel breath from his mouth, to employ hand gestures, to tread the talismanic array with his feet, sending forth thunder gods to drive the thunder generals, stirring the five directions’ barbarian thunders. He further taught him: Hai is the Gate of Heaven, upon which heavenly fire is raised; Kun is the Gate of Earth, where earthly fire arises; Mao is the Gate of Thunder, where thunder fire ignites; upon Wuzi arises the fire of sudden lightning; upon Si, Wu, and Wei the sun’s essential fire burns. The thunder roars fiercely, shaking Heaven and Earth; the fire blazes fiercely, as if mountains and fields were aflame. By these arts the evil is driven away and destroyed; spirits are terrified and subdued. This is called the "Art of the Five Thunders." Sa Jun again bowed in boundless thanks.

Thus, the three Taoists having each imparted their arts to Sa Jun, took leave and departed, leaving Sa Jun full of mixed feelings.

Yet it is unknown whether the arts imparted will prove efficacious or not; let us see what follows.
