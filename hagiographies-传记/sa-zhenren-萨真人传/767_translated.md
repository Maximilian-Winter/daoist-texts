# Chapter the Fourth: Master Sa Tests the Wondrous Methods on the Road; Master Sa Subdues the Malignant Maniac Spirit

It is related that Master Sa, having received the teachings of the Three Taoist Teachers, journeyed on, applying their methods, and indeed all were found efficacious. How was this efficacy shown? One day Master Sa came to the region of Yunyang, where there was neither village in front nor shop behind. Unconsciously his belly was famished; therefore he chanted a spell upon jujubes and took them to eat. Stretching out his sleeve, behold, the jujubes did indeed arrive. It was unknown whether they fell from heaven, or welled up from the earth, or were sent by ghosts and spirits. Master Sa took three pieces and ate them; his hunger was immediately assuaged.

Further on, he came to the district of Xiangyang, where he saw a household urging workmen to make a coffin for the dead. Master Sa inquired, “What is this coffin made for?” One answered, “My father is grievously ill and is about to die; therefore this coffin is prepared for him.” Sa said, “Why not summon a physician to restore his life?” The man said, “Many medicines have been taken, yet none avails.” Sa replied, “I will heal him for you.” Thereupon he took his palm fan and fanned him. Indeed, with one fanning the fever abated, with two a coolness arose, with three the flesh and bones shuddered, and the sickness was at once cured. The man prostrated himself and said, “My father owes his life to your grace; the favour of Heaven cannot be repaid!” Master Sa hastily helped him up and said, “To succour men and benefit things is the duty of us who have left the world; there is no need for worship or prostration.” Soon after, the man offered ten taels of white silver as thanks. Sa said, “I am one who has left the world; I have no use for this silver.” So he refused and departed.

Not half a day’s journey further, he suddenly heard a mournful crying, lamenting, “Young son, young son! Zeng Shen could not nourish Zeng Xi; Yan Lu grieved for Yan Hui.” Master Sa heard this and was deeply moved, saying, “This must be the cry of one who has lost a son.” He went to the house and saw an old man, to whom he asked, “Old sir, why this bitter weeping?” The old man said, “At fifty years I begot a son, now only nineteen, who has suddenly died. I am old and have no heir; therefore I weep.” Sa asked, “How long has your son been dead?” The old man answered, “Not long; the breath but recently departed.” Sa said, “If so, old sir, you need not weep; I can restore him to life.” He then affixed two talismans upon the dead body, waved his palm fan, and behold, the dead man stirred and soon arose. The father embraced him and wept, saying, “I thought that father and son could not meet again; what good fortune to have your soul returned!” He then asked his son, “How came you to return to life?” The son replied, “Just now I went to the realm of shades; suddenly two messengers pursued me, saying, ‘Return quickly, return quickly.’ I then felt a breeze under my arms, and so flew back with the messengers.” The father pointed to Master Sa and said to his son, “This is the gentleman who saved your life.” Thereupon father and son knelt on both knees, bowed twice, and thrice worshipped. Master Sa seeing the old man thus worship, hastened to return the salute, saying, “You are my elders; please rise, please rise.” The old man again offered gold and silks in thanks. Sa said, “I am one who has left the world; I have no use for these things; please return them.” So they parted.

One day he journeyed to the district of Wuchang and again heard the sound of weeping, lamenting, “Young lord, your son is but a child; your wife is alone; how can you bear to depart to the nether world?” Sa’s heart was sore and grieved; he went to the house and saw a girl of about twenty-two or twenty-three, her appearance gentle and pale, her tearful eyes flowing long. She was the very one described thus:

> Her jade-like face lonely, tears dripping from the balustrade,  
> Like a pear blossom branch with spring rain.

Master Sa asked, “Young lady, why this bitter weeping?” The girl wiped her tears and said, “My husband is but twenty-three years old; now he has died suddenly, leaving behind a young son of five years old, and me, a lone and desolate concubine. I weep for this.” Sa said, “When did your husband die?” She said, “Not long ago, but a few moments.” Weeping again, Sa said, “Young lady, do not be so sorrowful. Since your husband’s death is recent, I can restore him.” He then affixed two talismans on the body, waved his palm fan, and the dead man stirred and was revived. Behold the young couple: the wife seeing her husband return from death, the husband seeing his wife’s tears, they embraced and wept. Their weeping was even more grievous, saying, “The bird with wings joined was nearly torn apart by a fierce hawk.” Then the wife asked her husband, “How did you return to life?” He said, “I had already reached the Naihe Bridge, about to cross, but fearing peril, hesitated. Suddenly two messengers came and grasped my hands, saying, ‘Return, return.’ Their breath stirred a cool wind beneath my arms, and so I flew back.”

Master Sa was near, and the wife said, “He who gives life is this gentleman’s power.” The couple then knelt and worshipped. The husband said to Master Sa, “Sir, you are our reborn father.” Sa said, “Though I revive you, it is also because the bond of your past lives is not yet broken. Please rise; there is no need to bow.” The couple, moved by Sa’s kindness and unable to repay it, offered their daughter’s ornaments and garments in thanks. Sa said, “To aid the people and benefit all things is the proper duty of one who has left the world; there is no need for thanks.” He returned her treasures, and they parted.

Master Sa journeyed onward to the district of Jiujiang, where he saw a household afflicted with a man possessed by a malignant spectre. This man was crazed and mad; on his head he wore no hat, on his body no clothes, on his feet no shoes or stockings, naked to the skin. Whenever he met excrement he ate it; if he met urine he ate that also. Moreover, he frequently seized the women of the house for sport. His parents bound him with chains at home, beating him with peach branches and willow rods from dawn till dusk; but his body bore no marks and he felt no pain. At night he would loosen his chains and go out; his parents would bring him back, lock him up, add more chains, and bolt the heavy doors. The next night he would again slip his chains and break the seals, going forth.

Despairing, his parents summoned exorcists. They sent their servants to invite a master, who came accompanied by four brothers, five in all, to assist in the rites. They were confident, but one said, “Master, this ghost is most fierce; you must take care.” The master said, “My magic is highest, my methods most wondrous; I have overturned the altar of Lord Zhao, and broken the temple of Lord Yan. This demon, how much power has he to resist me?” They set up two high altars, one for the chief master, the other for the assistant. Two masters each forged a ball of fiery energy, blew their ritual horns which sounded wailingly, shook their ritual knives which clanged loudly, and summoned the five spirits of the army and the five spirits of the warriors.

The chief master bore a fiery bowl on his head; the assistant held a ritual whip. With three junior disciples guarding, they entered the possessed man’s chamber. The mad spirit looked up, resembling a monkey demon, with eyes blazing like a fierce golden beast. The chief master shouted a great cry, and the spirit answered with a roar. The master shouted twice, the spirit answered twice. The chief master’s face flushed red with anger and passion; he struck the fiery bowl sharply. The spirit blew upon it, causing the sparks to whirl and explode. The chief master did not burn the demon, but singed his own hair and eyebrows.

Helpless, the chief master blew his horn to summon the soldiery of madness to aid his magic. Unexpectedly, the spirit with a wave of its hand sent the horn high into the empty air, never to fall. The chief master, enraged, threw away his knife, which the spirit also sent floating in the air, unreachable. The chief master tumbled head over heels, as if to overturn the gates of heaven and shake the axis of earth, but the spirit with a finger suspended him on the east side. The assistant master seeing this, struck with his whip, was also suspended in the air by a wave of the spirit’s hand, and tumbled head over heels; he endeavoured to rescue the chief master, but again was suspended by the spirit’s finger on the west side.

Behold, these two masters hung dangling without ropes, suspended in midair. Not content, the spirit played tricks, striking their hands and heads repeatedly, causing them to split open and bleed. What was this like? Like two hanging mallets clashing and opening, opening and clashing, a merry play.

The three junior disciples seeing their masters thus suspended were terrified; they dared not tumble nor strike the fiery bowl; hastily they retreated and beat their ritual gongs, crying, “Armies of heaven, troops of earth, fire masters, gods of thunder, Mother of Mount Lu, True Lord of Mount Mao, Five Mad and Five Brave, come swiftly!” Before they finished, the spirit appeared, seized two of the junior disciples, threw one to the left and one to the right. Then with a hand pressed heavily on the head of the one on the left, and lifted fiercely the head of the one on the right, as if a thousand pounds were pressing down; neither could stir. Only one junior disciple seeing the ill fortune fled in haste.

All watching clapped their hands and laughed, saying, “What masters who overthrew Lord Zhao’s altar! What masters who broke Lord Yan’s temple! The masters did not drive away the mad spirit; but the evil demon drove away the masters.” The masters paid no heed to the laughter, but fled, running two li before they met Master Sa. Sa asked, “Master, why so hurriedly running?” The master, panting, said, “In that village is a household with a mad spirit. My brothers and I, five in all, went to treat him. Two were suspended, two were pressed down, only I escaped untouched. I have never seen such a fierce demon.” Sa said, “Go back; I will drive him away for you.” The master shook his head, saying, “Old sir, do not always take my word for it. That demon said he would deal with all five of us; but of the five only I entered. If you go, you will only be added to the number.” Sa said, “My magic differs from yours; I shall go.” The master said, “My magic is also high; but this demon is many times higher than I.” Sa said, “Will you dare return if you go?” The master replied, “The turtle escaped the golden hook; wagging tail and shaking head, I will not return.” So he fled.

Good Master Sa, hearing of the masters suspended and pressed, would he not go to rescue? A living soul, maddened, would he not cure? He went alone to the mad spirit’s house. Indeed the man’s hair was dishevelled, his eyes yellow, naked as before. He saw two masters hung in midair, two pressed on the ground. Sa mounted the ritual platform, summoned the gods, calmed his breath, moved his palms, and invoked the Eastern Wood Thunder Lords of Jia and Yi, the Western Metal Thunder Lords of Geng and Xin, the Southern Fire Thunder Lords of Bing and Ding, the Northern Water Thunder Lords of Ren and Gui, and the Central Earth Thunder Lords of Wu and Ji. He also summoned the heavenly fire, earthly fire, thunder fire, thunderbolt fire, and the sun’s supreme fire. Thunder roared, fire blazed; the shock of thunder shook heaven and earth, the flames burned and scorched the air. In a brief moment, the thunder gods and fire spirits seized the mad spirit.

The mad spirit knelt on both knees, kowtowing and striking his head upon the ground, saying, “Immortal master, spare my life! Spare me!” Sa said, “What manner of spirit art thou? Declare thy true nature.” The spirit said, “I am the malignant spectre of this village, who thirty years ago plundered the wealth and treasures of this house. The family was grateful and annually offered sacrifices to me. But for six or seven years they have poured no cup of thin wine nor burnt a bundle of paper money, so the lesser spirits are resentful and have caused disasters and mischief. I beg the immortal master’s pardon.” Sa said, “By your own confession, the blame lies not wholly with you; the master of the house is also at fault. I now command the master of this house to continue the former sacrifices. You must reform and desist from further mischief.” The spirit said, “I dare not again.” Sa said, “You may release the two masters suspended, and raise up the two pressed down.”

In a moment, the spirit pointed east and west; the two suspended masters gently descended from the void. Then with a finger left and right, the two pressed down slowly rose from the ground. Soon after, the ritual horn, knife, and whip fell to the ground. The masters gathered their implements and together bowed in thanks to Master Sa. They were not left living.

Now the malignant spirit having left his madness, the man regained his true nature, and full of shame hastened to comb his hair, don his hat, put on clothes and shoes, and came to thank Master Sa, saying, “I owe my life to your grace.” Sa said, “Your disaster was also fate. The malignant spectre was once protected by the shade of your house; from now on you must not omit his offerings.” The man assented and withdrew. His parents, grateful for Sa’s virtue, offered silver and gifts in thanks. Sa did not accept, but said, “Those four masters suffered great loss on your account; you should thank them.” The parents complied, completed their thanks, and Sa took his leave, journeying straight to the prefecture of Guangxin to visit the Celestial Master. Let us see what follows.
