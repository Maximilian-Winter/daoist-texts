# Chapter Five: The Supreme Clarity Meets Master Zhang the Celestial Teacher; The Record of the Charm and the Presentation of the Realized Person

It is said that Master Sa, having quelled the spirits of the demons and goblins, journeyed onward, arriving at Mount Longhu of Guixi in Guangxin Prefecture, Jiangxi. This Mount Longhu is indeed a blessed land. Behold:

The mountain ridges extend in long succession of peaks, the waters flow in winding courses. On the left is arrayed the sinuous, creeping Azure Dragon; on the right coils the upright and stately White Tiger. Upon the mountain rises the faint, ethereal clouds of auspicious vapour; before the cave condense the thick, lingering hues of propitious rosy mists. The planted pines are the ancient and verdant evergreens; the bamboo shoots are the vigorous and dense stalks. Among them the birds fly and dance—the brilliant, resplendent purple orioles; their cries and calls are the lofty, reserved white cranes. The fragrant and the delicate are the rare and wondrous jade flowers; the soft and the tender are the luxuriant and lush precious grasses. There are thirty-six palaces, each palace burning incense of rich and fragrant musk, dragon's gall, and ambergris; there are also seventy-two temples, each temple blowing the plaintive sounds of phoenix flutes and ivory pipes. A poem bears witness, reading thus:

> Clouds enclose the herb chambers, filled with worldly breath,  
> Jade flowers and precious grasses bloom in spring throughout the year.  
> A hut is built in heights where no man comes,  
> At midnight a new phoenix perches upon green bamboo.

The scene of the Supreme Clarity Palace is a subject for another time. Master Sa, with in his sleeve a letter from the Daoist Jing, came straightway to pay homage at the Celestial Teacher’s mansion. There the scenery was especially wondrous. Without the gate flowed several curves of river, clear and limpid, naturally shaped like silken ribbons; beyond the river rose layers of fine mountains, towering and grand, a picture opened by Heaven. The vermilion towers stood abruptly, high and piercing the clouds; the painted pavilions were light and bright, dividing the sun and moon. Master Sa entered the main gate, whereon was a couplet inscribed:

> Within the Qilin Hall dwell guests divine,  
> In Mount Longhu’s midst, the chancellor’s home.

Sa advanced through the first gate to the second gate, where, again, was a couplet inscribed:

> Red clouds embrace white cranes as they return, this very place is the dwelling of men and gods;  
> Precious grasses and jade flowers arise here, wherefore seek elsewhere the isle of Penglai?

Master Sa, passing through this gate, ascended several steps and arrived at the hall of the Celestial Teacher. Upon seeing the Teacher, he prostrated himself and said: “This poor Daoist comes from Western Shu; on the road I met a certain Daoist Jing, who claimed acquaintance with the Realized Master; he entrusted me with this letter, earnestly hoping it be received.” The Teacher bade the attendant take the letter and ordered Master Sa to withdraw to the corridor. Unfolding the letter, he saw that it bore the handwriting of his father, Master Xu Jing, and burst forth into loud weeping, which in turn alarmed his mother, the Primordial Lady. She hastened forth, asking: “Why does my son weep so grievously?” The Teacher handed her the letter, and she exclaimed: “This is the writing of thy father!” She also wept aloud, then inquired of the Teacher: “From whence came this letter?” The Teacher replied: “Just now a Daoist brought it.” The Lady asked: “Where is the Daoist now?” The Teacher said: “He waits below the corridor.” He then commanded someone to summon him.

Master Sa, upon seeing the Primordial Lady, prostrated himself. She asked: “From whence didst thou obtain this letter?” Sa answered: “I am a man of the Western River in Shu, drawn by the lofty spirit of Master Xu Jing, and also by the Taoist arts of the Three Immortals—Wang Fangping of Jianchang and Ge Xianweng of Jiangzhou—and have come far to pay respects. At Xiakou Pavilion I met three Daoists: one was Daoist Jing, one Daoist Ping, and one Daoist Weng. They said Master Xu Jing and the Two Gentlemen Wang and Ge have all passed on; each of the three imparted to me some method of Taoist art. This letter is from Daoist Jing.” The Primordial Lady said: “According to thy words, Daoist Ping is Wang Fangping, Daoist Weng is Ge Xianweng, and Daoist Jing is Master Xu Jing.”

Upon hearing this, Master Sa was greatly astonished and said: “Indeed, indeed! Were it not for these three masters, how could I receive such arts, calling on the dead to save the dying, driving away evil and extinguishing demons?” The Lady then spoke to the Teacher: “Look now upon the words of thy father’s letter.” The Teacher carefully read it aloud:

> “Son, know this from thy father. I have shed my mortal coil, and now roam the Jade Capital; it is not death. Thou and thy mother need not grieve. Thou shalt inherit the seal of the Celestial Teacher, diligently fulfil thy office, faithfully continue the immortal spirit of thy forebears, and never fail the teaching of the Law; this is my earnest hope. Be diligent, be diligent. Master Sa of the Western River in Shu has come far to pay respects; I, with the Two Immortals Wang Fangping and Ge Xianweng, have each imparted one method to him. Thou shalt also give him the Record of the Charm to wear, and present him as a Realized Person, so that his method may be more manifest and renowned; this is the glory of our Immortal sect. The treasured sword I leave thee may be entrusted to him. There is no other message in this letter. Take it to heart, my son.”

Having finished reading his father’s letter, the Primordial Lady said to the Teacher: “Since thy father has so commanded, to present Master Sa as Realized Person, thou mayest follow and act accordingly.” The Teacher replied to the Lady: “How could I disobey?” The Lady withdrew to the Fragrant Pavilion, and Master Sa bowed and thanked her; but this is not the place to dwell upon it.

Meanwhile, the matter of presenting the title led Master Sa and the Teacher together to the Hall of the Three Clarities. What is called “Three Clarities”? They are the “Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Spirit of Supreme Clarity,” the “Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning of Jade Clarity,” and the “Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue of Great Clarity.” These Three Clarities are the founders of the Taoist tradition; thus the Supreme Clarity Palace has a hall dedicated to these Three Clarities.

At that time, when the Teacher arrived at the Hall of the Three Clarities, he commanded the assembly of Daoist officials—Directors, Furnace Officers, Pan Officers, Declaration Officers, Scribes, Music Officers, and a host of Daoists—to kindle the thick, dense incense; to light the splendid, blazing candles; to burn the brilliant lamps; to beat the ding-donging drums; to sound the humming, resounding bells; to blow the clear, resonant flutes; to play the plaintive sheng; and to strike the golden bell, the jade pan, and the cloud zither.

The Teacher donned the ritual robes, placed the ritual cap upon his head, held the elephant scepter in hand, and performed the rites, reciting:

> “The Great Ultimate divides the lofty and the profound,  
> The light and pure ascend and belong to Heaven.  
> If man can cultivate the Supreme Way,  
> His body becomes a true immortal.  
> He travels three thousand courses,  
> His time numbered by tens of thousands of years.  
> The Altar opens the precious lotus,  
> The golden mouth and waters are preserved and passed on.”

Then he proclaimed:

> “I, Zhang Dao Ling, descendant of the mysterious progenitor,  
> Celestial Teacher so-and-so, with reverence and awe, bow and prostrate myself.  
> Humbly I serve Master Sa Shoujian of the Western River in Shu, presenting the Record of the Charm,  
> Declaring him a Realized Person, so that the fragrant flow of the Taoist tradition, the extended immortal lineage,  
> May be manifest and glorified. With utmost reverence I submit this memorial.”

Having concluded, the Teacher took the Record and burnt it. As it was consumed, one saw a wisp of smoke sparkling and flickering, forming the two great characters “Realized Person,” which soared slowly and gently up to the Celestial Palace. At this moment, Master Sa knelt again, gazing upward with boundless joy. Having presented the title, the Teacher removed his ritual robes and cap and returned to his mansion. Master Sa bowed his thanks without end.

It is said Master Sa, having been declared a Realized Person, desired to return to Shu and took leave of the Teacher. The Teacher, not willing to part so soon, prepared a banquet to send Master Sa on his way. What delicacies stood upon the table? Pure and spotless celestial peaches, green and clear celestial wine, bright red celestial peaches, smooth and glossy celestial oranges, round and perfect celestial jujubes. Also fragrant and savory eight treasures, and the seven treasures soup, a feast indeed: leopard foetus, bear’s paw, purple camel hump—all excellently stir-fried; eagle’s breast, orangutan lips, golden carp tail—various rarities. Master Zhang the Celestial Teacher acted as host, Master Sa as honoured guest, the worthy host and noble guest exchanged courtesies, drinking deep till the moon rose over the parasol tree and the silver arrow signalled the hour.

Soon, the sky grew light. Master Sa took leave of the Teacher and departed. At that time, the Teacher, following his father’s command, took forth a treasured sword and gave it to Master Sa, saying: “This sword can slay evil, can protect the Law; cherish it well.” Master Sa bowed and received it. The Teacher, reluctant to part, accompanied him on a palanquin, escorting him beyond the eastern suburbs. At their parting, he spoke this verse:

> “Thou comest from Shu, and again returnest to Shu.  
> At the head of the white clouds in the heavens,  
> I gaze afar, wondering where thou art.”

Master Sa, touched by the Teacher’s affection and unwilling to part, likewise recited a poem:

> “Eight thousand li to pay homage at the Jade Capital,  
> Arriving there, joyous beyond measure.  
> Today we meet and again must part,  
> The azure clouds and verdant trees all bear our feelings.”

Thus Master Zhang the Celestial Teacher and Master Sa exchanged their verses and took their leave. Zhang returned to his mansion; Master Sa mounted the courier road. What befell Master Sa on the road, what evil spirits opposed him, we shall see in the following chapter.
