# Chapter Six: Wang E Subdues the Monkey and Horse Spirits; the Perfected One Destroys the Sacrificial Boys and Girls

Now it is told that in the prefecture of Hengzhou, in the region of Xiangyin, to the south of the Southern Mountains there dwelt a wild monkey spirit, and to the north of the Northern Mountains there dwelt a wild horse spirit. What manner of spirit was this wild monkey? Behold:

A pair of eyes flashing with light,  
A body covered with tangled hair.  
A pair of lively hands,  
A soft and supple waist a foot round.  
Lightly it flits around the trees,  
Swiftly it runs over the hills.  
Crafty as the Monkey King,  
Proud and fierce among beasts.

What manner of spirit was this wild horse? Behold:  
Softly it swings its tail,  
Its mane disordered and flowing.  
Alive and agile as a black steed of ten feet,  
Swift as a gust of wind.  
Faster than the Red Hare,  
Mightier than the Black Dragon.  
A fearsome and terrible demon beast,  
Strong and fierce, bullying the bears.

This wild monkey spirit and wild horse spirit, one taking the Southern Mountain, the other the Northern Mountain, possessed all manner of ability and magic power. The deer, the elk, the fox, the stag, on seeing them, trembled and cried out "Great King!" Even the tiger, called the mountain lord, upon beholding these two spirits, would make a mark of respect, calling himself their junior. When the spirits exercised their powers, they sent forth fiendish winds and exhaled strange vapours; the sky darkened and the earth blackened. Whoever stood before them became dizzy and stupefied, as if drugged; their bones grew soft, and they could no longer move. Some were dragged away by the wild monkey spirit, others carried off by the wild horse spirit. Day by day, the wild monkey spirit dragged away one or two, and the wild horse spirit carried off three or four.

The villagers of that district—fathers losing sons, weeping for their children; wives losing husbands, weeping for their lords; elder brothers losing younger brothers, weeping for them; younger brothers losing elder brothers, weeping for them—the cries of lamentation filled heaven and earth. Whenever families gathered, no one said, "My son was dragged away by the monkey spirit," but rather, "My father was carried off by the horse spirit;" no one said, "My younger brother was dragged away by the monkey spirit," but rather, "My elder brother was carried off by the horse spirit." Truly it was as the saying:

> Let not the sorrowful speak to the sorrowful,  
> For sorrow when spoken of kills men.

There was a man surnamed Wang, given name E, a native of the prefecture, of fierce nature and extraordinary strength. One night, while walking through the mountain valley, he saw a blaze of fire suddenly arise. Wang E shouted loudly, and the fire was extinguished. Marking the place, he returned the next day with his hoe to dig, and found a pit of pure iron, weighing over a hundred jin. Wang E took it home, hired blacksmiths, built several furnaces, and with hundreds of jin of charcoal, forged a steel whip. Behold:

The murderous aura surged, the cold gleam fierce.  
Forged and tempered, neither literary nor martial fire,  
Moulded and cast, neither gold nor silver but iron of the earth.  
Its joints measured like the not too large nor too small vessel known as the hu,  
Its sections crafted with the care of bamboo nodes neither loose nor tight.  
Wielded, it was a snake neither light nor heavy,  
Grasped, a three-foot snow neither long nor short.  

This whip could be likened to Hu Jingde’s strike upon Zhang Shigui with exactness,  
Or to Zhao Xuantan’s conquest over ghosts and spirits without difference.

Having forged this whip, Wang E heard of the spirits of Xiangyin, consuming countless men, and declared with resolve: "In olden days, Zhou Chu was but a common man who slew the flood dragon of Yixing and the white-foreheaded tiger of the Southern Mountain. Now the wild monkey spirit of Xiangyin is only comparable with the flood dragon of Yixing’s waters; the wild horse spirit only comparable with the white-foreheaded tiger of the Southern Mountain. Zhou Chu had his sword; I have my whip; tomorrow I will rid these two evils."

Some sought to dissuade him, others to encourage. Those who dissuaded said, "Such spirits exhale fiendish vapours so that heaven darkens and earth blackens; if you provoke them, will you not be courting death?" Those who encouraged said, "You are a gallant and brave man; are you to fear a mere monkey spirit or horse spirit? If you do not go, you cannot be called a hero."

Thus incited, Wang E’s words flamed forth, his breath smoked within his nostrils. Clad in a short shirt and skirt, tight socks, his head bound firmly, his belt fastened securely, wielding the steel whip, he made his way to Xiangyin, first to the Southern Mountain to expel the monkey spirit. Fearing the spirit would not come forth, he disguised himself as a woodcutter and sang:

> The clouds rest on the familiar woods,  
> The fragrant grass on the broken cliffs, the path hard to find.  
> From the western hills I see the morning rain,  
> By the southern stream the crossing grows deep at dusk.

Hearing this song within his cave, the monkey spirit deliberated to drag out the singer, to strip him of sinews and skin, and make a feast of him and his monkey sons and grandsons. But he was unprepared to meet this adversary. Behold Wang E: in hand the steel whip, eyes shining like a Muslim warrior, thick bearded like a needle of steel, face dark like the Thunder God, tall as a heavenly deity. The spirit feared him greatly, yet thought, "I exhale fiendish vapours that darken the sky and earth, and have eaten thousands upon thousands of men; what care have I for this man?" He seized a weapon and with a breath of fiendish vapour rushed out.

Wang E parted the fiendish vapour with his steel whip and struck the monkey spirit. The spirit wielded an iron rod and met him. One the steel whip with skill, one the iron rod with magic power—thus they fought several rounds. Wang E, strong of arm, feigned a flaw; the monkey spirit struck down, but Wang E parried and touched him with the whip’s tip, whereupon the spirit was routed and fled. Wang E pursued to the cave’s mouth and dealt the wild monkey spirit a final blow with his whip. Entering the cave, he struck every monkey son and grandson, scattering them to the winds, wiping them out utterly.

Having disposed of the monkey spirit, Wang E journeyed to the Northern Mountain to expel the horse spirit. Waiting long, the horse spirit did not appear. Wang E then feigned a herdsman and sang:

> Seeking not fame in temple halls,  
> Lying on the lush grass in the slanting sun.  
> Rising, no yellow calves are seen,  
> Searching near the fallen flowers and flowing water.

Hearing the herdsman’s song outside, the horse spirit thought, "This fool sends himself to death; he will not go to Heaven’s road, but rushes headlong into Hell’s gate." Resolved to seize him and feast on him and his horse sons and grandsons, he rushed out. Unaware, he met Wang E armed with the steel whip, eyes shining like an owl, face dark like a barbarian, voice loud as Zhang Fei tearing the Baling Bridge. Though fearful, the spirit thought, "I will exhale fiendish vapour to weaken his bones and cloud his eyes; will he not be afraid?" He breathed forth and leapt upon Wang E.

Wang E roused his spirit and, though struck by the vapour, neither eyes dimmed nor bones ached. He raised the steel whip and struck at the horse spirit. The spirit leapt two or three zhang high, pounced to bite, then leapt again to kick. Repeating these leaps and attacks, the spirit was met by Wang E’s whip strikes from left and right.

Unable to resist, the horse spirit was struck by a whip. It fled swiftly, Wang E gave chase to the cave’s mouth. Not expecting pursuit, the horse spirit did not evade, and Wang E dealt it a final blow with his whip. Entering the cave, he struck all the horse sons and grandsons until flesh was torn, souls fled, leaving the place clean and desolate.

After ridding the two spirits, the villagers came to see the heaps of bones in the monkey spirit’s cave to the south, the piled bones in the horse spirit’s cave to the north, shuddering with horror. Though Wang E had subdued the two spirits, he had been affected by their fiendish vapours and had overexerted himself; before long he too breathed his last. The villagers all lamented, saying, "Such a hero, what a pity!" They prepared a coffin and buried Wang E. Let this pass for now.

It is said that the city god of Xiangyin, hearing that Wang E died ridding the land of harm, honoured him as a martyr in life and a heroic spirit in death, reporting this to the prefectural city god, who reported it to the provincial city god. The provincial city god accordingly reported to the Jade Emperor, who decreed that Wang E should become a divine spirit of Xiangyin, receiving offerings from the region, and be worshipped once yearly. Wang E accepted the decree of the Jade Emperor, and appeared miraculous and holy in the region of Xiangyin. The inhabitants built a temple to him called the Temple of Broad Blessings, and the deity was named the King of Broad Blessings. Every year on the third day of the fourth month, the villagers would slaughter pigs and sheep, cook chickens and roast geese, and arrange offerings with order and ceremony.

Behold this temple on the day of sacrifice: men and women throng in the thousands, incense burns by the cartload, paper offerings by the boatload. Who would know that this divine spirit was a wicked man in life, and a malignant god in death? One year, as the sacrifice approached, there came a sudden voice: "You blessed households, I have done much for your region, and under the Jade Emperor’s decree, I am to take the blood offerings of this land. Each year you offer pigs, sheep, chickens, and geese; the taste is not fine. This year’s sacrifice must be of boys and girls."

Hearing this, the blessed households trembled one by one. Among them were men of noble spirit who knelt before the temple, saying, "Lord King, you are a god who aids the blessed and protects this land; why then do you harm the boys and girls of the people?" The divine spirit, hearing this, was greatly angered: "You residents do not obey the divine decree; detestable, detestable." Suddenly a great wind arose, fierce and terrible:

> One breath of wrath howls,  
> Forests break, birds lose their nests.  
> Shadows darken the ridge,  
> Waves rise on the river.  
> Willows of the pavilion break,  
> Thatched roofs are torn away.  
> Boats sway and overturn,  
> Countless souls are lost.

After the wind, a heavy rain fell, fierce indeed:

> At noon the sun shrouded,  
> Thunder suddenly crashes.  
> Dense clouds gather from the earth,  
> Torrents pour from the sky.  
> Like the Milky Way cascading,  
> Like a basin overturning the White Emperor’s city.  
> The plains and fields suddenly flood,  
> As if the Han River lay across the land.

Yet the rain was not the worst; then came hail, fierce and cruel:

> At first like lizards spitting,  
> Suddenly the hidden shadows stir.  
> Stirring seas and roaring rivers,  
> Mountains crack and stones shatter.  
> Hard pellets like silver bullets,  
> Bright as crystal.  
> Do not say the heavens are strange;  
> It is the ghosts who show their punishment.

This wind was no ordinary wind. Other winds merely blow leaves and scatter flowers, and even the fiercest break branches, uproot trees, and carry dust. But this wind cast stones into the water and blew men into the sky. The rain was no ordinary rain; formerly rain washed dust and softened clods, and the fiercest broke banana leaves and drenched peach blossoms. Never before had rain fallen with the force of a silver river poured over a heavenly moat, swift as waves crashing through the sea gates. The hail was no ordinary hail; formerly hail was the size of peas or grains, the largest like cherries of the imperial garden or plums of the Eastern kingdom. Never hail as large as a bushel, as hard as stone, each weighing five or six jin.

See now this divine spirit: to defend his claim, he brought wind, rain, and hail, devastating the great village so that not one tree remained, not one cluster of grain was left, not one tile upon the roofs. Ducks and geese in the ponds were all killed, birds on the mountains were all struck down, travellers on the roads were mostly wounded, and cattle and sheep in the fields were mostly dead. When the wind, rain, and hail ceased, the King of Broad Blessings asked, "Blessed households, will you offer boys and girls in sacrifice to me?" Seeing the devastation, the blessed households reluctantly consented, and the spirit’s anger ceased.

The village of Broad Blessings consisted of ten districts. These districts, having agreed to offer boys and girls, decided by lot who would offer first; the lot fell upon the first district. The head of the first district asked the eastern households for a boy, who replied, "My dear son, how could I part with him?" He asked the western households for a girl, who replied, "My precious daughter, how could I part with her?"

The heads were at a loss. It was the first day of the fourth month, and the sacrifice approached. They wished to buy children elsewhere but feared missing the season. There was a man surnamed Liu, given name Duan, wealthy and owning fifty or sixty maidservants and seventy or eighty male servants. Liu Duan was unkind and indifferent; the male servants and maidservants were not paired, nor the maidservants with the male servants. Girls of twelve or thirteen years, with desires awakened, knew how to play the pipa. Among them was a clever male servant and a comely maidservant. The maidservant and the male servant exchanged glances; the male servant was moved by affection. The two went to a secluded spot and took part in the act of love. At the moment of greatest bliss, the maidservant embraced the male servant, calling, "Dear brother, you make me so happy!" The male servant embraced her, saying, "Dear sister, you make me so content!"

See their fondness, left and right, whispering and murmuring, unaware that "walls have ears, and outside the window are watchers." Liu Duan came upon the place, heard clearly, smelled distinctly, and shouted loudly. The maidservant and male servant, their clothes all removed, were caught in the act of illicit love. Liu Duan ordered his household to bring them before the hall and said, "You two are disorderly; by family law you shall be beaten to death." The maidservant and male servant begged repeatedly for mercy. Liu Duan replied, "Very well, the Temple of Broad Blessings requires boys and girls for sacrifice; better you be offered to Broad Blessings."

Liu Duan’s words were but the opening. Soon the heads of the sacrificial committees came in twos and threes to fetch them. The maidservant and male servant were bathed in fragrant water, and at dawn on the fifth watch were sent to the temple for sacrifice, with offerings of pigs, sheep, and wine, and the two placed on trays as boy and girl. Ordinarily, the sacrifice required the ten districts’ households to kneel and worship, but with boys and girls offered, only one or two heads of districts remained in the temple to pour wine.

The households said the spirit only captured the souls of boys and girls, and did not eat them. Yet after two or three cups of wine had been poured, the spirit, who did not eat pigs, sheep, chickens, or geese, but only men, devoured the boys and girls, stripping away hair and toes, bones and skin, consuming them alive. The few pouring the wine were so frightened their souls left them.

The first district’s sacrifice lasted one year without issue, but then became an established rule. Every year on the third day of the fourth month, one boy and one girl must be sacrificed. The second district followed the third, the third the fourth, and so on. At first, the second district bought children elsewhere, but by the third and fourth districts, the households were required to offer their own children; bought children were not accepted. This was not the saying, "Without this precedent, this precedent cannot be set up; with this precedent, this precedent cannot be abolished," but rather, "With this precedent, it cannot be set up; without this precedent, it cannot be abolished."

Meanwhile, the Perfected One Sa, having returned from the Palace of Supreme Purity, passed by this place. At the gate of a household he saw a banner raised, inside lanterns and incense burning fragrantly, and bright music sounding. Sa thought, "Surely this is a home holding a ritual." He approached to see who the devotees were. An old man saw the Perfected One and hastened to greet him, inviting him to the tea hall. After formal greetings, the old man turned a chair for the Perfected One to sit, and himself sat below. The Perfected One asked, "Sir, your surname and name?" "I am but a humble man surnamed Gao, named Biao." "How many brothers have you?" "Only one younger brother named Jie." The Perfected One asked, "Is your household holding a Qingmiao ritual or a Bao’an rite?" Gao replied, "Today is a preparatory ritual for the dead." The Perfected One asked, "A preparatory rite is a preparatory rite, a dead-man’s rite is a dead-man’s rite; why call it a preparatory dead-man’s rite?"

Old Gao bowed and said, "Sir, you have just come from afar; have you seen the towering temple?" The Perfected One said, "I have seen it from afar but not yet visited." Gao said, "That temple is called the Temple of Broad Blessings, with a divine great king called the King of Broad Blessings. Some years ago he subdued a monkey spirit and a horse spirit here; the Jade Emperor commands him to take blood offerings of this land, therefore he is called a divine great king." The Perfected One said, "Pray tell me, sir, what is meant by 'divine great king'?" Suddenly Old Gao wept, saying, "Sir, that great king 'responds to the region, inspiring temple building; his mighty spirit aids the people a thousand li around. Yearly he sends down sweet dew on the fields; every year clouds of blessing fall on the villages.'"

The Perfected One said, "He sends sweet dew and clouds of blessing; that is benevolent. Why then are you so troubled and sorrowful?" Old Gao stamped his foot and beat his breast, crying aloud, "Sir, though he grants many blessings, he also has grievance; though he is merciful and kind, he harms men. Only because he demands boys and girls, he is not a straightforward and upright god."

The Perfected One asked, "Does this divine spirit require boys and girls?" Gao said, "Indeed. Each year at sacrifice one boy and one girl, with pigs and sheep and libations, are offered. He devours them in one sitting, and ensures our wind and rain accord. If not sacrificed, disasters fall. This year the sacrifice is due in my household." The Perfected One asked, "How many sons have you?" Gao beat his breast, "Alas, alas! Sons? Shame upon me! I am sixty-three years old, my younger brother fifty-nine, and children are scarce. At fifty I took a concubine and had a daughter, now just eight years old, named 'One Tael of Gold'." The Perfected One asked, "Why the name 'One Tael of Gold'?" The old man said, "Because children are scarce, I repaired bridges and roads, built temples and towers, and gave alms to monks. I kept an account, and at her birth I had over thirty jin of gold; thirty jin is one tael, hence her name." Gao's brother had a son aged seven named "Gao Guanbao." The Perfected One asked, "What is the meaning of that name?" Gao said, "We offered to Lord Guan, and by his altar received this son, hence the name 'Guanbao.' Unexpectedly this year the sacrifice falls to my house; I dare not refuse, so the bonds of flesh and blood are hard to sever. I have arranged a ritual for the departed children with my nephews, thus the preparatory dead-man’s rite."

The Perfected One, hearing this, could not restrain tears and said, "Sir, having only a daughter before you and a nephew with your brother, how can you bear to sacrifice them alive?" Gao said, "This is beyond choice." The Perfected One asked, "Could purchased children be substituted?" Gao said, "At first the spirit accepted purchased children, but now only demands one’s own; purchased children are rejected." The Perfected One said, "Bring forth your daughter to see."

Gao hastened indoors and brought out One Tael of Gold, then called his brother Jie to bring out Guanbao and placed them before the hall. The children knew not life or death, holding fruit in their sleeves, munching, then suddenly fell into Gao’s arms calling "Father." The brothers could not hold back tears, saying, "My children, you are my children today, tomorrow the feast of Broad Blessings." They wept aloud.

The Perfected One, moved with pity, said, "Sir, do not weep; these two children—(text missing)." Gao said, "Sir, how will you save them?" The Perfected One said, "I am Sa Shoujian of Xihe in Shu, a cultivator devoted to the Way, having met three immortals—Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng—who taught me three methods of Dao. If I use this thunder method, this divine spirit will be removed, and he will not devour your children." Gao said, "If it works, it is blessing; if not, it is misfortune." The Perfected One said, "I will ensure you have blessing, not misfortune." He instructed Gao and his brother to keep the two children indoors and not to send them to the temple the next morning, and went alone to the Temple of Broad Blessings.

What followed afterwards is yet to be told.
