# Chapter Seven: The Perfected Immortal Burns the Guangfu Temple; the City God Commands Wang E to Inspect

Now it happened that the Perfected Immortal Sa proceeded straight to the Guangfu Temple, and there he beheld the multitude of the Fu households beating the bell and sounding the drum, arranging incense, flowers, lamps, and candles in orderly array. Then the spirit attendant spoke again, and asked: "Today is the day of the sacrifice at the Gao family’s house; why have the offerings not yet appeared?" The Fu households replied: "The Gao family doubtless prepare a rich and sumptuous sacrifice, hence their delay." The spirit attendant further inquired: "Are the child-boy and child-girl indeed Gao Guanbao and Yicheng Jin?" The Fu households said: "Great King, by your mighty power we dare not alter them." The spirit attendant said: "If so, those two tender ones shall suffice for enjoyment."

Before he had finished speaking, the Perfected Immortal Sa stood without the temple gate, with the triple-stage hood covering his head, the Eight Trigrams protecting his person, his feet firmly planted. He grasped the Great Fortune Wen, Lian, and Wu breaking the Northern Dipper's power beneath his feet; in his hand he held the Secret Art of the Fire Heaven Lord of the Leaving Mandate, victorious over the Southern Dipper. Then he proceeded to summon the Barbarian Thunder of the Five Directions, and ignited the Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire, Thunder Fire, Rending Lightning Fire, and the Three-Flavored True Fire of the Sun; then he blew a breath of the Xun wind. The thunder roared, the fire blazed fiercely, the wind howled mightily, and so the Guangfu Temple was set ablaze in a sheet of crimson flame. One saw:

Flames issuing from the beams, fire springing upon the pillars, the blazing heat scorching heaven and earth; the fierce radiance illuminating mountains and rivers. At first, the deep scent of sandalwood incense was wafted to the nostrils; now the sound of gongs and drums were no longer heard. This was like the first destruction of Xianyang; this was like the burning of the Ao Temple in full blaze. The bell-ropes snapped as the cup-shaped Pulao broke; the incense burner shattered as the precious duck-string snapped. The bonfires turned into fiery hair; the incense tubes became coal smoke. The burning was such that the judges could no longer hold their brushes; the little demons dared not raise their fists. Guangfu Wang was burnt to a scorched head and broken brow; the earth gods’ faces were blistered and their shoulders wilted. The Fu households, terrified, fled east and west; the temple master screamed in terror and complaint. Truly it was because of the child-boy and child-girl that the living immortals were offended. He let loose the pitiless fire; such is the Power Keeper Sa.

Meanwhile, as the flames roared in the Guangfu Temple, the Fu households with sons clasped them and fled; those with younger brothers bore them away. At that time, who cared for the temple buildings? The temple master ran eastward to save some clothes, westward to save a pair of shoes; down to the kitchen to save pots and rice steamers, spoons, chopsticks, bowls, and dishes; to the sleeping chamber to save mats of straw, straw cushions, cotton quilts, and sheets. At that time, in the midst of confusion and alarm, who cared for the Bodhisattva?

A good Bodhisattva though carved of wood and bamboo, yet truly possessed some spiritual efficacy. Seeing the firelight near, it leapt forth bravely, and jumped out of the temple gate. Afterwards, looking more closely, one saw a Daoist standing before the temple gate, driving thunder and commanding fire. The spirit attendant was roused to anger: "Anger rises from the heart; hatred springs to the gall!"—he seized a steel whip and smote at the air. The Perfected Immortal, seeing that the spirit attendant came with ill intent, waved the treasured sword granted by Master Zhang Tianshi, and warded off the steel whip. The whip came striking from the left, the sword warded it on the left; the whip came striking from the right, the sword barred it on the right; the whip came striking from above, the sword barred it above; the whip came striking from below, the sword parried it below.

Yet the spirit attendant was helpless; just as he was about to summon his troops to assist him, the Perfected Immortal again summoned the Barbarian Thunder in his palm, and struck him fiercely; ignited the blazing fire in his hand, and burned him fiercely. How could the spirit attendant withstand this? Therefore he asked the earth god of the temple: "Who is this man who destroys my sacrifices and burns my temple?" The earth god said: "This humble god but recently came to the Gao family. The land god of the Gao family said to me: 'In the West River of Shu there is a Sa Power Keeper who has obtained the arts of Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng, three immortals, and also the treasured sword granted by Master Zhang Tianshi. This sword flies hither and thither, slaying heavenly gods above, and earth fiends below.' Today the one setting fire to the temple and destroying the child-boy and child-girl sacrifices is this very person."

The spirit attendant, hearing these words, sighed silently: "Since this man has such powers, what shall I do against him? But I, for the blood sacrifices of Guangxiang Wang to this land, am but a vassal reporting to the City God of Huguang Province. I will go and see the City God, and ascertain what is to be done." So he rode a cloud of mist straight to Huguang Province. There he beheld a temple in which was a spirit attendant, wearing a black silk head-dress, a bright red robe, a golden belt about the waist, and holding an ivory tablet. His face was clear and handsome, teeth white and lips red, powdered, with three tufts of beard. On his left stood rows of judges; on his right rows of little demons, all awe-inspiring and fierce.

Guangfu Wang arrived there and saw an earth god before the temple; he asked: "Is this temple the City God’s?" The earth god answered: "It is so." Guangfu Wang asked: "What is the City God’s surname and name?" The earth god said: "Do you not know his origin? He is Ji Xin by name. In the days of Han Gaozu he was a faithful minister who died in service. When Han Gaozu obtained the empire, he appointed him City God." Guangfu Wang said: "There are many city gods in the empire; are they all named Ji?" The earth god said: "In the two capitals and thirteen provinces, in every prefecture, every district, every county, the city gods are named Ji. Even those who have built cities among the Eastern Barbarians, Western Rong, Southern Man, and Northern Di, and set up temples, their city gods are all named Ji!" Guangfu Wang said: "Why is this City God so especially majestic?" The earth god said: "This City God is the master of a province; the city gods of prefectures are more majestic than those of districts; the city gods of districts are more majestic than those of counties."

The origin of this City God is not here recorded. Guangfu Wang entered the temple and bowed low before the City God; as their ranks and dignities were high, he made a kneeling salutation. After the obeisance was finished, the City God asked: "What earth god art thou?" Guangfu Wang said: "I am surnamed Wang, called E. In old days I subdued two spirits, Monkey and Horse, in the region of Xiangyin; the City God of Xiangyin, Master Shen Wen, pleaded for me before the Jade Emperor, who decreed that I might take blood offerings from that place. But unexpectedly in Shu’s West River there is a man named Sa Shoujian who burned my temple and destroyed my sacrifices. Now I and my fellows have not a single tile to shelter us. I hope your honour may take pity." The City God said: "This Sa Shoujian, hearing that he has obtained the Tao arts of Zhang Xujing, Wang Fangping, and Ge Xianweng, and now bears the title Perfected Immortal, with vast magical powers and boundless skill, how canst thou prevail against him? To complain to me today is idle. It is better that thou accompany him for twelve years, await his error, and then thou shalt be permitted to strike him dead with thy whip, to revenge the former grievance; and I will report this to the Jade Emperor. If he has no fault, and thou strikeest him without cause, the guilt will be thine."

Guangfu Wang rejoiced secretly, saying: "Sa Shoujian, Sa Shoujian, say not twelve years; even twelve hours shall suffice to avenge thee. If not twelve hours, then twelve days; if not twelve days, then surely twelve months. It will not come to twelve years." The City God seeing Wang E so glad, feared that in seeking private revenge he might rashly harm the Perfected Immortal. So he sent a messenger from his own office to accompany Wang E as an inspector, a magistrate. If Sa Shoujian erred, Wang E was allowed to whip him; if not, he must not take private revenge rashly. Wang E consented and went forth; the talisman messenger likewise promised to accompany him. This matter we leave for the moment.

Meanwhile, the Perfected Immortal Sa, having burned the Guangfu Temple, came to the Gao family’s house. The Gao brothers, grateful that he had saved the two children, made ready a sumptuous feast to thank the Perfected Immortal. They killed a newly born pig, a soft-haired sheep, a cock that crows at dawn, a goose with red feet, a duck with a green head; they also netted several brocaded fish, and arranged all in neat order.

No sooner had the Perfected Immortal arrived than he asked: "For what purpose is this feast prepared?" Gao said: "We, being grateful for your saving of the young daughter and nephew, have prepared this feast as a small return." The Immortal was greatly surprised, and said: "For my sake alone you have slaughtered so many lives; this is my guilt." He clasped his palms and repented, repeating without ceasing the Sutra of Disaster Dispelling and Sin Eradication. Afterwards he said to Elder Gao: "I am but a recluse; I abstain from wine and meat. You have laboured to prepare this; please take it away."

The Gao brothers were astonished, and said: "Since the Master eats only vegetarian fare, our humble home has nothing but simple fare to offer." The Immortal said: "No need. I would take my leave." Elder Gao said: "Guangfu Wang has burned the temple; if you leave, what if he come and do harm to my house? Better that you stay here a year or two." The Immortal said: "That spirit attendant was burned by me; how dare he come again to do mischief? You may rest assured." The Gao brothers repeatedly entreated him to stay; the Immortal was forced to remain for a month or two. The Gao brothers, knowing that the Master was a vegetarian, sent their servants to prepare vegetarian fruit and vegetables.

It was the fourth month; in the garden, besides the loquat, plum, apricot, and cherry, no other fruits were to be found. Yet in the house were stored fresh tangerines, sweet sugarcane, round and clean large chestnuts, and neat and pure earth melons. With these fruits, they gathered celery from the southern ravine, dug bamboo shoots from the western garden, sought wood-ear mushrooms on the eastern hill, and procured cattails from the northern hill. They cooked fragrant rice of the Qingjing variety, brewed tender early spring tea, opened translucent Jinhua wine, and prepared smooth and slippery jade-clear soup. These vegetables, fruits, and foods were placed on the table by house servants, and the Gao brothers went to invite the Immortal to dine at noon. The Immortal said: "Much obliged, venerable sirs, but I have received the Tao art of the spell jujube from Master Ge Xianweng. Every three jujubes count as a meal; nine jujubes cover a day. These fruits and vegetables I need not eat." Elder Gao said: "So the Master fasts thus." Then he asked: "How is the spell jujube made?" The Immortal replied: "Simply by uttering the spell, the jujubes come of themselves. Now I borrow a small box to place on the table; I will utter the spell over a few jujubes and present them to you worthy brothers." Gao Jie said: "A wondrous art it is."

He placed a box on the table; the Immortal uttered a few incantations: "Yangjiao, yangjiao, lulu, lulu, an he mou ni ba fu hong." As the spell was ended, several jujubes as large as pears appeared in the box. Elder Gao laughed, saying: "Master’s art is marvellous indeed!" The Immortal distributed them to the Gao brothers; Gao Lao took one, Gao Jie took one, Gao Guanbao and Yicheng Jin each took one, the wives of Gao Biao and Gao Jie each took one, and so on, until all were given. The Immortal finished distributing. Gao Biao and Gao Jie ate the jujubes; indeed their taste was extraordinary, and a single jujube sufficed to fill the stomach. They said: "Master, with such precious things, why still eat these wild fruits and mountain herbs?" So they withdrew the feast.

Now the Perfected Immortal Sa lived in the Gao household for more than a month. One day, he desired to take his leave. Elder Gao could not detain him, and so presented him with one hundred taels of silver, one hundred taels of gold, fifty bolts of coloured silk, and fifty strings of copper and iron, as reward for his saving the children. These were displayed in the courtyard. At that time Wang E was looking down from the netherworld, and said to the talisman messenger: "If this man accepts such great wealth it is but a transaction with me; I must strike him with my whip." So he raised his whip, ready to lash him. The talisman messenger said: "Let us see if he accepts it; be not rash."

The Perfected Immortal, seeing the gift, was astonished, and said: "Old sir, what is the meaning of this offering?" Elder Gao said: "Our young daughter and nephew have received your saving grace; we present this as thanks, hoping you will graciously accept." The Immortal said: "I am a recluse; I have no parents to support above, no wife or children to nourish below. I do not go to be a guest or traveller, nor do I receive officials or taxes. Why should I need such heavy goods? Please take them away." Elder Gao said: "Once there was a yellow sparrow, struck by a hawk and near death, saved by Yang Bao, who afterwards bore double rings in gratitude. We, your humble brothers, have received your deep kindness. To refuse gold and silk would be less than a bird. We pray you accept." The Immortal said: "Old sir, the heart's sincerity suffices! If you must thank me with gold and silk, this is not love but a burden. I firmly decline to accept."

Gao Biao and Gao Jie knelt together, determined to have the Immortal accept the gifts. The Immortal also knelt and said: "Rise, rise." Elder Gao said: "Master, if you will not accept this small gift, we brothers shall kneel till tomorrow." The Immortal said: "Very well, rise; I will accept one string of coins." Elder Gao said: "Please accept silver and gold." The Immortal said: "One string of coins suffices." Elder Gao said: "Please accept the coloured silk to make garments." The Immortal said: "I have this patched hood sufficient for a lifetime; what need have I of garments?" So they parted. The Gao brothers were deeply grateful.

The talisman messenger, seeing this Immortal’s lightness of wealth and weight of righteousness, said to Wang E: "This man is a good man, a good man." Wang E said: "Magistrate, do not praise him too much; there must be some flaw in his future path. I will with my whip dispatch him; it is only a question of sooner or later."

But whither the Perfected Immortal Sa went, and what fault Wang E the spirit attendant would find in him—these matters we leave to be told below.
