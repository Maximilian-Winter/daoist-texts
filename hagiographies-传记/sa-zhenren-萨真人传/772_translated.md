# Chapter Nine: Li Qiongqiong Disregards the Woman's Duty — Master Sa Ren Abstains from Womanly Charm

It is said that one day Master Sa, a Perfected One, journeyed to a certain place called Saihua Village. Why was it called "Saihua Village"? The village lay among hills of strange shapes; on the east, west, south, and north were ridges resembling a beautiful woman reclining on her back, commonly called “The Beauty Competing with Flowers.” The village took its name from this form, and was called Saihua Village. Within this village, the women were many and loose in their conduct.

There was one Li Qiongqiong, who was married to Zhou Tianrong. Tianrong had a sworn brother named Yao Jiude, who was Prefect of Chengdu Prefecture in Sichuan. When Tianrong went to his post to visit, Yao Jiude welcomed him as an old friend met in a foreign land, and with exceeding joy detained him at his post, so that two years passed without Tianrong’s return. Meanwhile, his wife Qiongqiong, left at home, kept two lovers. One was Liu Jiaolang, the other Shen Junlang. These two, Jiaolang and Junlang, considered themselves bosom friends, having studied together as schoolfellows, with a friendship as close as Guan and Bao who divided gold, and as loyal as Lian and Lin who cut their throats for each other. Liu Jiaolang was also related to Zhou Tianrong as a maternal cousin; he called Li Qiongqiong his cousin-sister-in-law.

One day, Jiaolang came to Tianrong’s house to inquire whether his cousin brother had gone to Chengdu, and if any letter had come back. Li Qiongqiong came out to meet Jiaolang. Upon seeing her, he noted her graceful countenance, her gentle demeanour; her waist was as tender and pliant as misty willows, her face like a dewy lotus just emerging from water. One should not envy Qin Nongyu playing flute in the tower, nor boast of Wang Zhaojun plucking her pipa on horseback. Jiaolang, on seeing her, deeply sang a greeting, saying, “Cousin-sister-in-law, I pay my respects.” Li Qiongqiong quickly returned the greeting, saying, “Uncle Jiaolang, please do not take offence.” Then she asked, “Uncle Jiaolang, since cousin brother went away, you have not come to my house; what matter vexes you so?” Jiaolang replied, “There is no such matter. Only the master has come to inspect, and the examination is near; we must read our books, and so have not been able to come.”

Since her husband had left, and not knowing how many fine occasions she had missed, Li Qiongqiong, upon seeing this Jiaolang, whose countenance was as refined as Pan An and whose talent rivalled Zi Jian, could not help but feel her heart flutter. Liu Jiaolang was a young man; upon seeing this Qiongqiong, “More communicative than flowers, more fragrant than jade,” he too felt the stirrings of spring in his heart. Truly:

Fair maidens with comely looks and gallants bright,
Their talents and charms both worthy of delight.
New willows fond the orioles, orioles the trees,
Bright flowers dazzle butterflies, and butterflies flowers please.

Li Qiongqiong asked, “Uncle Liu, will you marry this year?” Jiaolang replied, “I am gradually ashamed, gradually ashamed; my marriage is not yet arranged, it is still early.” Qiongqiong said, “With such a young and talented gentleman, why worry about lacking a wife?” Jiaolang perceived some tenderness in Qiongqiong’s manner, and asked, “Sister-in-law, since your cousin brother left, are you lonely sleeping alone? Do you not strike the bed or overturn your pillow?” Li Qiongqiong only smiled without replying. Jiaolang again said, “If sister-in-law does not disdain me, I will come this very night to keep you company.” Qiongqiong again smiled without speaking.

Seeing that Qiongqiong had some interest, Jiaolang drew near and embraced her, and kissed her on the mouth. See how they were both stirred with desire, like fish playing in water, like phoenix seeking its mate; they went into the bedchamber, unbuttoning, loosening silk girdles, removing clothing, carried away with their ardour, grasping the rain and holding the clouds — how joyful they were! When their intercourse was finished, Jiaolang took his leave. Li Qiongqiong promised to bid him come early that night; their intentions lingering — but that is not for now.

Liu Jiaolang returned to the inn and told Shen Junlang all that had passed, saying thus and so. This made Shen Junlang’s soul fly beyond the heavens and his spirit scatter into the nine skies. At dusk, Liu Jiaolang said, “You must sleep alone tonight; I will go to sister-in-law’s house to spend the night.” Shen Junlang replied, “You go on ahead.” Though speaking thus, he contrived a plan: when Jiaolang left, he silently followed. Arriving at the Zhou household, they saw Li Qiongqiong seated by lamplight; upon seeing Jiaolang, the two embraced and called each other “heart and soul.” Shen Junlang suddenly stepped forward, calling out, “Good sister-in-law! Good sister-in-law!”

Li Qiongqiong was startled. Liu Jiaolang said, “Damn you, why have you come?” Li Qiongqiong asked, “Uncle Jiaolang, who is this man?” Jiaolang replied, “He is Shen Junlang, my sworn brother.” Li Qiongqiong then made a courtesy to Junlang. Shen Junlang, seeing this woman indeed had “lips like cherry blossom with a pure mouth, a slender waist like willow shoots; her face resembled the fair Wenjun, impossible to depict in painting,” was utterly entranced. Li Qiongqiong, too, seeing Shen Junlang handsome and gentle, was charmed as Cui Yingying loved Zhang Sheng, and not only Han Xiangzi delighted in Wenjun.

Shen Junlang said to Liu Jiaolang, “Sworn brother, sworn brother, tonight we shall share the pleasures of wind and moon; how can one monopolize the spring of Shanglin alone?” Liu Jiaolang replied, “You are my dear friend; what need for words? Just ask sister-in-law Qiongqiong.” Qiongqiong said, “Since you, Lord Shen, are Jiaolang’s sworn brother, I cannot refuse.” Thus the three shared one bed. Li Qiongqiong lay in the middle, Shen Junlang inside, Liu Jiaolang outside.

That night, Shen Junlang was first with Li Qiongqiong. See how new acquaintances delight in each other, with tender meanings, with warm caresses, with gentle fondling; their kisses tasted as if sugared, their breath fragrant in their nostrils. Truly:

No joy surpasses that of new acquaintance.

When Shen Junlang finished, then came Liu Jiaolang’s turn. See how the two, having joined once by day, now loved more and more, affection increasing upon affection. Liu Jiaolang called out, “Dear, dear sister-in-law!” Qiongqiong called out, “Gentle, gentle uncle!” How exquisite their delight! Then Shen Junlang asked Qiongqiong, “Is all done with Qi? Is all done with Chu?” Qiongqiong replied, “I look before, and suddenly am behind.” So, facing outward she embraced Jiaolang; facing inward she embraced Junlang. Truly:

The bridal chamber’s spring is like the sea,
Each moment worth a thousand pieces of gold.

How joyful were Li Qiongqiong, Liu Jiaolang, and Shen Junlang! From then on, the two men came by night and left by dawn — but that is not to be told here.

Now it is told that Master Sa journeyed to Saihua Village, arriving when the sky was already late. The Master looked forth toward the front village and saw no smoke from any hearth; he wished to advance, but saw the hills were high and the trees dense. Just then, he came to the Zhou household’s front gate, where there was a narrow door. The Master dared not disturb those within, and quietly sat beneath the narrow door, intending to pass the night and depart at dawn. Little did he know Li Qiongqiong saw him from inside, and thought, “Tonight I have invited Liu Jiaolang and Shen Junlang to our secret meeting; this Daoist here at the door is most inconvenient.” She called a young servant named Zhou Bao, whom Tianrong had hired to supply firewood and water when he went to Chengdu. Qiongqiong said, “There is a Daoist outside the narrow door; bid him come inside to sleep.”

Zhou Bao went to Master Sa and said, “Sir, it is dark; it is uncomfortable to sit here; please come inside to rest.” The Master replied, “I am a man of the religious life; your place is not an inn; I do not wish to intrude.” But Li Qiongqiong said from inside, “Sir, outside is inconvenient; please come in to sleep.” The Master thought this woman was kind and followed the young servant inside to rest, not once asking if there was a man in the house.

Meanwhile, Shen Junlang and Liu Jiaolang went to a tavern to drink. Midway through their drinking, Liu Jiaolang said, “Tonight at Li Qiongqiong’s, let me be first to share the pleasures.” Shen Junlang said, “I will be first.” So they contended for precedence and even fought atop the tavern. Shen Junlang smashed a cup in Liu Jiaolang’s face; the broken cup cut Jiaolang’s cheek and blood flowed freely. Jiaolang took up a pair of chopsticks and struck Shen Junlang’s face, swelling his eye black and blue.

The two went to the study, where Liu Jiaolang said, “Let us not go tonight.” So they buttoned their robes and sat opposite each other by a green lamp, gazing silently. Meanwhile, Li Qiongqiong leaned by a door, looking this way and that, watching her two lovers, murmuring, “Last night both came in pairs; tonight why does not even one come? Jiaolang does not come; if only Junlang came, it would be good. Junlang does not come; if only Jiaolang came, it would be good.” She turned her thoughts over and over, growing more anxious and angry, truly looking herself blind, and thinking herself heartbroken.

At the third watch, Li Qiongqiong’s passion could no longer be restrained; her fire blazed fiercely, and she cursed, “You two wretches, may you both die young and bring ruin to others!” Suddenly she thought, “The Daoist who arrived late, with graceful bearing, is also a man of fine character; why not amuse myself with him? Would that not be good?” She took up a lamp and came to where Master Sa was sleeping. The Master had not yet latched the door; Li Qiongqiong pushed it open. The Master, on seeing her, bowed and rose. Li Qiongqiong made a courtesy, saying, “Sir, please do not take offence.” The Master made a respectful bow in return. At that moment, Wang E rose, lifting his steel whip, rubbing his fists and grinding his teeth, saying to the spirit attendant, “Prefect, Prefect, I have followed ten years and never met such a calamity; tonight he should die. If he shows any fault, strike him one whip.” Truly:

Yama has decreed death at the third watch,
He shall not live to the fourth watch.

The spirit attendant said, “This is a crucial moment; if Master Sa errs, you may deal with him as you see fit.” But this matter is left untold.

Master Sa returned Li Qiongqiong’s bow, saying, “Young lady, you have come to my place at night; what is your intent?” Qiongqiong said, “Sir, you came late; this woman has not been hospitable; now I come to keep you company.” Master Sa said, “Young lady, you err: ‘Do not adjust your shoes in the melon patch; do not straighten your hat beneath the plum tree.’ At moments of suspicion, you must be cautious and keep your distance. If others know, it will be most inconvenient.” Qiongqiong said, “My husband is far away; my parents-in-law are no more; only a young servant who sleeps soundly. Sir, be wise.” Master Sa said, “A woman should not lose the three obediences and the four virtues; that is the good path of womanhood. A man of religion must have pure six senses and empty five aggregates; that is the good path of the religious man. Young lady, you let this poor man be a good religious man; you must also be a good woman.”

Having spoken, he rose to leave. But Qiongqiong barred the door, saying, “Sir, once you enter my room, you shall not leave it. Where will you go?” Master Sa replied, “Young lady, consider the heavens; I do not wish to do such a thing.” Qiongqiong said, “Youth fades quickly; good occasions are rare. Tonight you have met me; if you do not share a moment with me, you are a fool. I have met you; if I let you go free, it is my folly.” She then pressed close to the Master, desiring union.

Helpless, the Master drew his sword, handed it to Qiongqiong, and knelt, tears flowing down, saying, “Young lady, if tonight you insist on union with this poor man, then I beg you use this sword to sever my head.” Seeing the Master’s words, Qiongqiong’s heart was eased, and she said, “Sir, you are a good man; pardon my folly.” She then took up her lamp and left. At dawn, seeing this woman’s want of virtue, the Master departed without a word.

The spirit attendant shook his head, stuck out his tongue, and said, “Such great calamity! Alas that Master Sa escaped; rare indeed! Rare indeed!” At this, Wang E somewhat relented and said, “At this critical moment, I meant to strike him with my whip; unexpectedly he escaped. I shall follow him two more years and see what happens.”

But what befell thereafter remains to be told. To be continued.
