# Chapter Ten: The Immortal Sa Embalms the Old and Pities the Young; Employs Thunder and Fire to Drive Away Pestilential Spirits

It is related that one day the Immortal Sa wandered again to a certain place called Xipu. In that wilderness of Xipu was found an old man dead, aged some eighty or ninety years; and there was left behind a young child, but two or three years old. At that time Wang E and the Talisman Envoy came before him at that place, and Wang E said, “Sa Shoujian is come hither. If he show no pity for the dead, nor care for the young child, this is indeed heartless and contrary to reason; we must needs give him a whip for this.” The Talisman Envoy replied, “To pity the young and to cherish the dead is indeed a great principle. If he have not this mind, I shall find it hard to teach you to forbear chastisement. Let us see how he behaves.” Before the words were ended, the Immortal Sa came forward. Only did they see on a crossroad an old man dead, leaving behind a child. How pitiable was the dead old man? Behold:

His long beard was like the snow of midwinter; his short hair seemed the frost of the ninth moon. His round face was deathly pale, with eyes not closed; his naked body shone blood-red. Beneath his feet were no worn-out socks or shoes; on his body not a scrap of fine or small clothing. Who was this solitary and forlorn aged father? From what place came this wrinkled and lonely old man? What reason had he not to die a calm and proper death? Why had he been left alone, lying dead by the roadside? The crows, seeing him, were about to gather in flocks and begin to peck; the yellow dogs, smelling him, gathered in twos and threes to attack one another. Such a sight was grievously mournful; truly he had died in terror and desolation. And the child left behind, how pitiable was he? Behold him:

Tearful eyes dropped tears, crying in wailing tones. Like a lone and helpless young lamb, like a lost and mute fledgling crow. Was this not Deng Bo-dao leaving behind his beloved son? Was it not the maiden Liu abandoning her lonely and miserable child? Alas, this tender and young babe, but two years old, why does he sob and wail at the crossroads? Other children are yet wrapped closely in swaddling clothes; but this child is cast away and flickering amid mud and dust. Look upon his countenance and find no laughter or playfulness; hear his voice and find only the calling of “nanny” and “father.” The wailing for his nanny is plaintive and mournful; his eyes look to his father with sorrowful and earnest gaze. Mark his pitiable and terrified behaviour, and it moves one’s heart to grief.

Now why was the dead old man without clothes or shoes? Because a beggar passing by saw this dying elder, and stripped off his clothes, shoes, and socks, so that he was left naked. The Immortal, arriving at this place, beheld the old man’s lack of proper burial and the child’s lack of sustenance, and could not but grieve deeply, tears streaming down his cheeks. Seeing the dead man without clothing or footwear, he took off two shirts and a pair of shoes and socks from himself, and gently clothed the dead. But he could not bear to hear the child’s crying; fearing his hunger, he quickly conjured a jujube, and gave it to the child to ease his hunger. The child ate the jujube and ceased to weep.

The Immortal wished to bury the old man, but had no proper coffin; indeed, in the wilderness there was no means even to dig a grave, no hoe or spade to borrow. In his distress, he took his magic sword and slowly used it to dig the earth. Though the earth was plentiful, he fashioned a burial shroud from a patchwork robe to wrap the body. What was this like? Much like the saying, “The virtuous daughter of the Zhao family, wraps earth with hemp skirts to build a tomb mound.”

The grave was dug two or three feet deep. The Immortal cut some branches from the east, and some banana leaves from the west, and laid a layer of these in the pit. Then he laid the dead man upon the branches and leaves, covering him with many folds of banana leaves, and finally he covered the corpse with earth. When all was done, he honed his sword and sheathed it. Then, carrying the child, he sought the boy’s relatives, thinking thus: “This old man must be the child's grandfather; the grandfather was probably carrying the grandson somewhere, but died here unexpectedly. This child surely does not wander beyond ten li from here.”

He went east to ask, but no one in the east village knew. He went north to ask, but no one in the north village knew. He went west to ask, but no one in the west village acknowledged the child. The Immortal was forced to go south, and there he came to a household where dwelt an elder of more than eighty years. Behold this elder:

He leaned on a bamboo stick neither long nor short, wore a cloth robe neither yellow nor white, donned a velvet cap neither high nor low, and tied a hemp sash neither large nor small. Truly he was one of the five elders of Xiangshan, one of the two sages of Shangling; though not a senior of the Qing dynasty worshipped in the ancestral temple, he was indeed a terrestrial immortal hidden among the reeds.

When the elder saw the child, he asked the Immortal, “Sir, whence have you brought this child?” The Immortal said, “Yesterday I passed through Xipu, and at a crossroads in the wilderness saw a dead old man and this child left behind. I buried the old man, and now carry the child seeking his kin. I have wandered a day and found no trace.”

On hearing this, the elder gave a cry of “Ah!” and tears fell unbidden. The Immortal asked, “Why do you weep, elder?” The elder said, “The dead man is Zheng De-weng, and this child is his grandson. De-weng was a man of great virtue, but he dwelt in a ruined abode, made a bad house, and thereby brought plague and disaster. This year his whole family was stricken with pestilence; a son and daughter-in-law were fatally ill, soon to breathe their last. De-weng feared that if this grandson were also infected by the plague, his line would end. He thought to carry the child to his daughter’s home for refuge. The daughter’s home lies some thirty li away; De-weng was ninety years old and surely could not make the journey, so he died here in Xipu. Alas! Alas!”

When he had spoken, he wept bitterly again. The Immortal asked, “May I inquire your name, and whether you are kin or clan to De-weng?” The elder said, “My humble name is Yang Fengji; I am neither kin nor clan to De-weng, but we were classmates in youth. De-weng died in Xipu, and I could not bury him; you, sir, have buried him. This child I could not save; you, sir, have saved him. I am truly grateful for your kindness.” The Immortal said, “Say not so.” Then he asked where De-weng’s home was.

Elder Yang pointed with his hand to the village ahead, saying, “That house is his home, but sir, you must not go there.” The Immortal asked, “Why do you bid me not go, elder?” Yang said, “I think De-weng’s daughter-in-law must be dead now, and spirits have gathered in her house; not only do they appear at night, but even by day they show themselves. Sometimes they throw bricks from the roof; sometimes they toss tiles from the upper storey. That place is now one where the road is empty of travellers, and the food is uneaten.” The Immortal said, “I have some magic arts which can drive away evil spirits and heal the sick. It is no harm if I go and see.” Elder Yang said, “Since you have such wondrous arts, there is no harm in your going; but this child should remain in my house.” The Immortal said, “I will carry him. If his father and mother yet live, seeing their son may lighten their illness.” Yang agreed, “That is so.” The Immortal then took leave of Elder Yang.

Just as he came to the Zheng household, indeed the spirits were many and varied: great and small, long and short, some with pale faces, some with dark-green, some with black, some with tangled hair, some with rolling eyes. They threw bricks and tiles, wielded sticks and played with fists. Even in broad daylight, they appeared thus; who then would have any boldness to approach?

The good Immortal, holding the child in his arms, collected his spirit, formed a talismanic sign, and in his palm moved the fierce thunder; from his fingers kindled the fierce fire. With thunder roaring and fire blazing, he struck the demons and spirits, scattering their souls and spirits, burning them till their hearts chilled and their gall split. In but a moment, it was as if hot water were poured on snow, leaving no trace or shadow behind.

The Immortal then entered the house, and saw De-weng’s daughter-in-law faint and near death. Using the palm fan given by the Celestial Master Wang Fangping, he fanned away the heat with one wave, brought coolness with a second, and caused the flesh to tingle and the bones to chill with a third; the couple, though revived from death, had been ill for more than half a month and had not eaten a mouthful of gruel or broth, and had little strength. The Immortal then chanted an incantation over some jujubes: “Sheep horn, sheep horn; deer road, deer road; an hong ne he ba fu hong.” The jujubes appeared from his sleeve, and he gave two to each of the couple. Upon eating, their bodies felt renewed and they rose from bed.

The child, seeing his parents, cried out loudly. The Immortal then opened his arms and gave the child back to them. They asked him, “Sir, how came our child to be in your arms?” The Immortal said, “Yesterday, passing through Xipu, I saw an old man dead by the roadside, and this child crying beside him. I buried the old man and, carrying the child, sought his relatives. Just now I met Elder Yang Fengji, who told me the dead man was your honored father, and this child your son; he also said you were gravely ill. I have driven away the evil spirits and healed your sickness, and now return your son to you.”

Hearing this, the couple burst into tears. The husband cried, “My father died without a proper burial.” The wife also wept, “Almost I lost my beloved son.” Together they knelt and bowed before the Immortal, saying, “Our father is indebted to you for burial; our son is indebted to you for rescue; our lives are indebted to you for preservation. We have no means to repay so great a kindness.”

The Immortal saw them fall before him, and quickly helped the husband up, and bade him take his wife by the hand, saying, “I am a man of the Way, assisting the people and benefiting beings is my duty; how can you speak of thanks? But your father is dead; you must arrange proper burial with coffin and shroud.” Having given his commands, he took leave and departed. The couple accompanied him to the gate, their hearts heavy with gratitude.

The Talisman Envoy seeing the Immortal’s conduct sighed, saying, “The virtue of Master Sa is rare among the ancients, and scarce found in the present age; how could the immortals be without him?” At this time Wang E also gave assent, saying, “This matter is indeed one of the most difficult.” Then the Envoy said to Wang E, “I have followed Master Sa these twelve years, and he has not erred by a hair’s breadth; he is truly an Immortal, and will soon enter the ranks of the celestial. You should throw in your lot with him, and serve as one of his generals; would it not be well?” Wang E said, “I obey your commands.” The Envoy said, “I will now go to visit the City God. I take my leave of you.” Thus they parted. This is not to be further related.

Now the Immortal one day came to the Longxing River, at the time of late autumn, the weather clear and cold, the water pure and the deep pool transparent. The Immortal, beholding the autumnal water clear and deep, stood by the stream and admired it, and thereupon composed a poem:

The wild water joins the sky, autumn one hue,  
The west wind is still, the green waves calm and true.  
Deep and clear, no speck of dust is stirred,  
Pure and profound, the bottom is all assured.  
Ten thousand acres cold, like silk-green jade,  
A river’s chill ripples, duck-head blue displayed.  
If the human heart were free from dregs and stain,  
Within the breast a jade mirror would remain.

As the Immortal chanted these verses, he saw in the water a divine figure, whose face was square, wearing a yellow kerchief, clad in golden armour, with the left hand holding his sleeve, the right hand grasping a whip, manifesting before the Immortal. The Immortal asked, “Who art thou, spirit?” The spirit answered, “I am the god of Guangfu Temple in Xiangyin, surnamed Wang, named E. In former days I exacted sacrifices of boys and girls, and the Immortal burned my temple. Now I have followed you twelve years, secretly watching, waiting for you to err so I might avenge my former grievance. Now that your merit is fulfilled and you are to enter the celestial ranks, I wish to petition to be one of your generals.”

The Immortal said, “Thou art a fierce and evil god. If thou dost act at will in my Law, thou wilt surely harm it; I will not admit thee. Go hence! Go hence!” The spirit said, “I now repent my past errors, turn from evil to good; if the Immortal will not admit me, where is the saying, ‘The gentleman aids men in their good deeds, and not in their evil’?” The Immortal said, “If thou sayest so, canst thou be constant to the end?” Wang E then swore an oath, saying, “This day I repent and turn to good; if I fail to be sincere from beginning to end, may thunder strike me in disarray, and may I fall forever into the prison of Yin Mountain.” The Immortal said, “So be it. Change thy name, alter the character ‘E’ (evil) to ‘Shan’ (good), and henceforth be called ‘Wang Shan.’”

Wang Shan bowed his head and thanked him. The Immortal said, “I now intend to journey to Fengdu, to succour some wandering souls and restless spirits. Canst thou accompany me?” Wang Shan said, “Since I am received by the Immortal, I dare not depart from him. If the Immortal goes to Fengdu, this humble god would gladly go with him.” The Immortal said, “Then come with me.”

But how the Immortal fared upon his arrival at Fengdu, we will unfold hereafter.
