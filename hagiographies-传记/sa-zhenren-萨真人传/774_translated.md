# Chapter Eleven: The Immortal Sa Journeys to the Kingdom of Fengdu — The Immortal Tours Throughout the Netherworld

It is said that the Kingdom of Fengdu is a realm of ghosts, situated at the very end of the earth. The Immortal Sa was a living man; how could he come thither? It was owing to his encounter with the Immortal Teacher Ge Xianweng. Daily he chanted incantations over jujubes and ate thereof; having thus purified his essence, his body became light and agile, and he trod the high mountains as if on level ground, and traversed the deep waters as if upon dry land. Therefore he could go to Fengdu. But why did the Immortal desire to go to Fengdu? Before he had studied the Way, he had been a knavish official who caused the death of men, and a quack physician who plotted to take life; having never saved a single soul, his heart was full of remorse and unrest; thus he resolved to journey to the Kingdom of Fengdu to save those many dead souls. 

When the Immortal arrived at that place, he saw the gloomy wind blowing keenly, and black mists spreading widely. Within a small city enclosure, a ghostly messenger with a blue face cried aloud, "What living man dares to approach this gate?" The Immortal replied, "What gate is this?" The ghostly messenger said, "Can you not open your eyes and behold?"

The Immortal looked up and saw written thereon the three large characters, "Ghost Gate Pass." He said, "I am a wandering Daoist, and would make a tour of the Kingdom of Fengdu; may the ghostly messenger permit me to pass?" The messenger answered, "Since you are a wandering Daoist, I will not exact the toll for passing; you may pass, you may pass." Then the Immortal entered through the Ghost Gate Pass.

The ghostly messenger saw Wang Shan, whose appearance was strange and monstrous, holding a steel whip, and asked, "Who is this divine attendant? Do not come to disturb our nether tribunal." The Immortal said, "This is a general under my command." The messenger replied, "Do not smuggle in spies." The Immortal said, "I dare not." So the messenger also permitted Wang Shan to pass. Having passed through the Ghost Gate Pass, and travelling but a few li, they came upon a lofty tower:

> Towering high and piercing the Milky Way,  
> Its railings set with a segment of white jade;  
> Beast-shaped incense burners breathe fragrant smoke upon imperial robes,  
> Crimson gauze lanterns brighten palace fans.  
> Fierce bulls' heads stand grim on the left,  
> On the right rise the rugged faces of mule-men.  
> They summon the deceased, handing out golden tablets,  
> Calling back souls and spirits with white banners.  
> Called the General Assembly Gate of the Nether Tribunal,  
> It is the Hall of Shura where King Yan dwells.

Outside, the Immortal looked left and right, and saw the ten generations of King Yan gathered upon the hall to discuss matters. Who were these ten King Yans? They were: King Qin Guang, King Chu Jiang, Emperor Song, King Wu Guan, King Yan Luo, King Tai Shan, the Lord of Equality, King Du Shi, King Bian Cheng, and King Zhuan Lun. The Ox-Head and Horse-Face spirits, upon seeing the Immortal, reported to King Yan, "There is a Daoist outside the Hall of Shura looking about inquisitively; he is a living man, and is accompanied by a divine attendant. We know not whence they come." King Qin Guang said, "This must be the Immortal Sa of the Western River of Shu." Emperor Song asked, "How know you this, honoured king?" King Qin Guang replied, "Recently, the City God of Huguang Province gave a full account of this man's virtuous deeds; he wears the talismanic register of Master Zhang Tianshi, and is known by the title of Immortal, his magical power manifest. When the Guangfu Temple was burned, the true god Wang Shan followed him twelve years, seeking to avenge a former grudge. Seeing that he committed no fault, he sought to have the Immortal enroll him as a general. He who comes here must surely be he; the divine attendant is indeed Wang Shan." Thereupon, he commanded the Judge Cui Yu to question him.

When Judge Cui Yu saw the Immortal, they mutually bowed their heads in salutation, and then he inquired, "Your Excellency has come hither; may we be favoured with your family name and given name?" The Immortal said, "My surname is Sa, my given name Shoujian; I am a man of the Western River of Shu. I come hither to see King Yan." Cui Huan asked, "Who is this divine attendant?" The Immortal said, "He is my subordinate general Wang Shan." The judge said, "If so, wait a moment." Then he reported back to King Yan, "Indeed the visitor is the Immortal Sa." The ten King Yans ordered the judge to invite him in.

When the Immortal came to the foot of the hall, the ten King Yans descended their steps to receive him. After the salutations were made, they took their seats, host and guest apart. King Qin Guang asked, "Immortal, what is your purpose in coming here?" The Immortal said, "My father and mother died in the nether tribunal; now your humble servant comes seeking an audience." King Yan Luo said, "Your honoured father and mother, having led blameless lives, have already been reincarnated in the heavenly kingdom." The Immortal further said, "Fifty years ago, before I had practised the Way, I was a physician and official; I did not think that as a physician I sometimes administered harmful drugs, and as an official wielded the pen to cause death; I have caused the deaths of several persons. Now I respectfully implore your Majesty to grant salvation, that these many souls who died unjustly may not bear resentment against your humble servant." King Yan said, "Do these souls know whether they have been reincarnated and left the nether world? The Immortal may seek them in the City of Wrongful Death." The Immortal said, "Might I have an attendant to guide me?" King Qin Guang said, "I now command Judge Cui to accompany you." Thus the Immortal took leave of King Yan and descended from the Hall of Shura. But this shall be passed over for the present.

Judge Cui Yu led the Immortal on a tour of the netherworld, Wang Shan attending. On the left wall was a high terrace, about twenty zhang in height, with two roads on either side; the right was the upper road, the left the lower. Beneath the terrace were countless souls, some ascending, some descending. Those going up were sad and silent; those coming down had tears streaming copiously. The Immortal asked the judge, "Sir Cui, what is this terrace?" The judge replied, "The Immortal knows not. When a man dies, on the first day his head is laid at the local earth temple; on the second day he is taken to the Dongyue Temple to see the Heavenly Worthy of Evenness and Benevolence, who registers his name; on the third day he arrives here in the Kingdom of Fengdu. Yet his heart is not yet resigned to death. King Yan has issued a decree permitting him to ascend this high terrace and gaze towards his native land; each must weep once, then he will resign himself to death. Therefore this terrace is called the 'Terrace of Longing for Home.'"

On the right wall was also a high terrace, about twenty zhang in height, but only one road on the left side, and no one walked upon it. The Immortal asked, "What is this terrace?" The judge said, "In life there are but two paths, the path of good and the path of evil. Those who have done good, after seeing King Yan, are sent by the Office of Rewards and Merits with banners, drums, and music to ascend to Heaven by this terrace, called the 'Terrace of Ascension to Heaven.'" The Immortal said, "Why is there only one road?" The judge replied, "Because it is a way upwards only, and none descend by it." The Immortal said, "Why do so few walk upon it?" The judge said, "How many in the world can ascend to Heaven?"

After walking a while, they saw to the left and right two high mountains; on one mountain smoke and fire blazed fiercely; on the other, weapons stood thick and dark. The Immortal asked, "What are the names of those two mountains?" The judge said, "The one with smoke and fire is called 'Flaming Mountain'; the one with the dense weapons is called 'Mountain of Knives and Spears.' There is a saying concerning Flaming Mountain: those who in life were cold-hearted, cold-bellied, and spoke harsh words that chilled others, upon seeing King Yan are sent to this Flaming Mountain to be burned until their sinews are softened and bones broken, their bodies reduced to ash by the furnace of coldness through the night. Concerning Mountain of Knives and Spears, those in life who were double-faced, dealt in secret arrows, secret knives, and had honeyed words with swords beneath their tongues, are sent to this Mountain of Knives and Spears, where they are cut and hacked until they become a mass of bloody pulp." As the saying goes:

> While living, you used your lips and tongue at will;  
> After death, you cannot escape the sword’s calamity.

After a while, they came to a river of blood flowing across their path. There was a golden bridge, a silver bridge, and a single-log bridge. Beneath the single-log bridge, some had fallen into the water, and many poisonous insects bit and harmed them. The Immortal asked, "What river is this? What bridges are these?" The judge said, "This is called the Nai River Bridge. There are some saints and sages in the world, and when they die, King Yan commands that banners and jeweled canopies receive them to cross upon the Golden Bridge. There are loyal ministers, filial sons and daughters, righteous men and chaste women, and men upright and honorable, who also are received with banners and canopies to cross the Silver Bridge. But those who in life corrupted the human order, opposed the laws of Heaven, and had wicked hearts and minds, must cross the Single-Log Bridge; if they fall into the blood river, then golden dragons, silver scorpions, bronze snakes, and iron eels come to bite and harm them. Those drowned whom you just saw were of this class of evil men." The Immortal said, "Good and evil receive their due in the end; the only difference is in the sooner or later."

After walking a while, they reached a solitary ridge. All around was silent; the chill wind blew upon their faces, cold rain fell softly; the place was full of desolation. The Immortal asked, "Sir Cui, what is the name of this ridge?" The judge said, "This is called the 'Ridge of Desolation.' In the nether tribunal, all who pass over this ridge shed tears twice as copiously, their hearts broken and exceedingly desolate; hence it is called the 'Ridge of Desolation.'"

The ridge was about three or five li in length, and people came and went upon it. They saw a group of three or five, all staggering east and west; one uttered "three coins," another "two lies." The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "They are drunkards." Another group of three or five were ragged in garments, with yellow faces and mouths, each clutching two great fists. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "They are poor ghosts."

Another group of five or seven had brows unraised, eyes unfocused, heads turned east, feet west, hands forward, bodies leaning backward; neither dead nor alive. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "They are plague ghosts." Another group of seven or eight or nine lay supine upon the ground, hands supporting, feet kicking, eyes rolling, mouths dry. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "These are desperate souls struggling for life." Another group of eleven or twelve were each wearing a cap without netting, a garment without skirt, shoes without socks, upper garments without lower, one carrying a cane in one hand, a coconut ladle in the other. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "They are all beggar ghosts."

Yet another group of six or seven carried a house beam upon their shoulders, and held a hemp rope in one hand. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "They are all ghosts who hung themselves." There was also a group of fourteen or fifteen; among them were some who held coins with yellow edges, scattering them upon the ground; others looked at their money from left to right, collecting it, then looking again, making a great noise. The Immortal asked, "Who are these?" The judge said, "Those who scatter money are squanderers; those who watch it are misers." Indeed the Ridge of Desolation was long, many ghosts passed over it, each with their own kind and appearance. The Immortal saw one and asked about it; the judge answered in turn, and so they passed over the ridge.

Whither they went henceforth the Immortal knew not. We reserve the continuation for the following chapter.
