# Chapter Fourteen: The Perfected Man Establishes a Great Offering at the Western River; The Venerable Xu Jing Ascends on High

It is said that the Perfected Man Sa returned to the Western River; his fields were still there, and his houses still stood. The Perfected Man then drew up the deeds of sale and sold them to others; with the price thus obtained he made ready a great offering lasting ten days and ten nights. He summoned yellow-crowned feathered attendants, and burned many kinds of pure incense, natural incense, and incense of non-action. He set before them many joyous ritual foods, nectar foods, and foods for men and gods. He recited many times the Scriptures on Crossing Over, the Scriptures on Dispelling Calamities, and the Scriptures on Deliverance from Suffering. He prostrated himself before many compassionate penitential rites, dark underworld penitential rites, and rites for the rescue of the lost. He raised up a banner and summoned all the solitary souls of the netherworld. The male souls gathered together in a body, the female souls in another body, the old souls in another, the young souls in another, the mad, the paralytic, the lame souls in another body; thrice daily they were fed with offerings, all in perfect order!

Yet this great fast moved the Jade Emperor in Heaven. The Jade Emperor feared that some reckless spirits, fierce demons, great devils, or little devils might obstruct the Daoist altar, and so he commanded the Marshal Ma Lingguan to descend and guard the fasting altar. Whenever the food was offered, the Marshal Ma Lingguan would see demons and devils in disorder rushing to seize the offerings; he would then burn them with the Samadhi Fire, scorching the offerings to a crisp, so that even the netherworld spirits could not partake of the food. Suddenly, in the Southern Sea there was a female Bodhisattva who perceived this. This female Bodhisattva was thus described:

Her face was like a full moon, her beauty like a pear blossom. On her temples were jewels and emeralds without ornament; her bosom was full of necklaces and hairpins intertwined. The Red Boy was wrapped in flames all over; the Dragon Maiden wore her hair in twin buns. In her bamboo basket was a golden carp; in her pure water vase were two lotus flowers. From the afar purple bamboo forest she gazed upon the water and moon; her home was in the depths of Mount Putuo.

This female Bodhisattva was none other than Avalokiteśvara, the compassionate saviour of suffering and hardship. She dwelt at Mount Putuo in the Southern Sea. With her wisdom eye she beheld that Sa the Perfected Man had set up this great offering, yet the spirits of the ghosts could not partake, and it was all in vain. Moved by a thought of compassion, she devised a plan. She mounted a cloud of auspicious vapour and went straight to the Western River, where she transformed into a ghost king, with three heads and six arms, a blue face and bristling teeth, and mingled among the spirits at the altar to seize the offerings. When Marshal Ma Lingguan saw this, he sent forth the Samadhi True Fire to burn among the spirits. What a ghost king was this! But then (Avalokiteśvara) sprinkled sweet dew water and the fire was extinguished. Truly it is as the saying: “Within the circle of myriad perfected ones, amid the radiance of a hundred million auspicious lights.” The spirits were then able to satisfy themselves with the pure offerings, and the cold forest was without complaint or suffering.

See then, Avalokiteśvara’s one thought of kindness — well done! well done! When Sa the Perfected Man’s ten days and ten nights of offerings were complete, he also distributed many offerings of netherworld money to aid the ghosts. He then made two more offerings of netherworld money and one official document of a tenth part, sending them by official messenger straight to the City of the Wrongly Dead, to be delivered to the Lady Zheng De. When the merit and virtue were complete, the spirits rejoiced and dispersed. Avalokiteśvara then revealed her true form, mounted a cloud of auspicious vapour, and returned to the Southern Sea. On the way she met the three immortals Zhang Xu Jing, Wang Fang Ping, and Ge Xian Weng. The female Bodhisattva received the cloud and recited a hymn to them.

The Celestial Master Zhang Xu Jing, along with Immortals Ge and Wang, held fast the cloud, and then asked: “Great Being, from whence do you come, and from where have you come to deliver from suffering?” Avalokiteśvara said: “Sa Shoujian in the Western River has established a great offering for the salvation of the lost; I came from there bearing sweet dew water.” Xu Jing said: “Well said, well said.” Then he asked: “Has Sa Shoujian now fulfilled his merit and virtue?” Avalokiteśvara said: “This man has cultivated for several decades, assisting the living in the Yang world, and transcending ghosts in the Netherworld; his merit is immeasurable. You should report to the Jade Emperor that he may enter the ranks of immortals and have his name inscribed as ‘Upper Clarity’.” The three immortals said: “We three have just returned from Penglai Mountain, and had this intention; tomorrow we will report it to the Jade Emperor and recommend this man.” Avalokiteśvara said: “I have heard that you previously transmitted the Dao to him; now again you recommend him — this is truly the perfect fulfilment.” Thus they parted. This matter will not be further mentioned here.

Meanwhile, Zhang Xu Jing, Wang Fang Ping, and Ge Xian Weng all came to the outer court of the Three Heaven’s Gate, where the Jade Emperor was then in his imperial hall. There they saw red clouds swirling and auspicious vapours rising; on the left sat the Sun Palace’s Solar Emperor, and on the right the Moon Palace’s Empress of the Great Yin; on the left were the Three Officials Great Emperors, on the right the Four Holy True Lords; on the left the twenty-eight stars of the zodiac, on the right the three hundred and sixty responsive celestial lords. Zhang Xu Jing together with Wang and Ge prostrated themselves before the Tongming Hall, and reported: “In the Western River of Shu, there is a Daoist named Sa Shoujian, who has cultivated for more than thirty years, wearing the triple talismanic register, and bearing the title of Perfected Man. He has saved living beings in the Yang world, and transcended ghosts in the Netherworld; his merit and practice are complete, and he should enter the ranks of immortals. We humbly beseech Your Majesty to send down a written decree to appoint him to the Celestial Pivot and confer the title of immortal.” The Jade Emperor, upon hearing this, was greatly pleased, and said: “Sa Shoujian has fulfilled his practice and merit, and shall enter the ranks of immortals; I will immediately send the Scarlet-Robed Envoy, mounted on the Red Qiu and holding the Jade Tablet, to bring him to Heaven and confer his immortal office.” Zhang, Wang, and Ge thanked the Emperor and withdrew from the Three Heaven’s Gate, escorting the Scarlet-Robed Envoy as he descended to the celestial court. This matter shall not be further related here.

It is said that after Sa the Perfected Man had completed his offering at the Western River, he dwelt at the Yongtai Temple, where he set up the alchemical furnace and refined the Great Returning Elixir. Using cinnabar as father, mercury as mother, and black lead as son, he applied the fire of the civil and martial arts, gathered the essence of sun and moon, and through seven returns and nine revolutions, formed the Golden Elixir. He was about to set out on cloud wandering when suddenly Wang Shan appeared in form and said: “A heavenly edict is about to arrive, summoning the Perfected Man to return and take charge of the Celestial Pivot; there is no need for you to go far.”

Before he finished speaking, from the blue sky above came faint coloured clouds, and from mid-air a fragrant scent wafted down, fragrant for a hundred li. Celestial music was played, clear and resonant. Presently the Scarlet-Robed Envoy arrived, mounted on a Red Qiu and holding the Jade Tablet, coming straight to Yongtai Temple. He produced a heavenly decree and handed it to the Perfected Man, saying: “Perfected Man, your cultivation and merit are complete; the three immortals Zhang Xu Jing, Ge Xian Weng, and Wang Fang Ping have recommended you to take charge of the Celestial Pivot. In the highest bliss of Heaven there is no suffering; you may depart swiftly.”

In a moment, the Perfected Man’s spirit passed away, and he followed Wang Shan and the Scarlet-Robed Envoy straight to the heavenly palace. Upon reaching the Three Heaven’s Gate, the three masters Zhang, Wang, and Ge were already there awaiting. The Perfected Man, seeing them, was overjoyed and prostrated himself, saying: “Your servant Sa Shoujian, formerly favoured with transmission of the Dao, now blessed with recommendation; the grace of Heaven is beyond repayment!” The three masters said: “You have transmitted our Dao and expounded our teaching; you have fulfilled our hopes — this is joyful, indeed joyful!”

After speaking, Wang Shan came forward and paid homage; the Celestial Masters asked: “Who is this person?” The Perfected Man replied: “This is Wang Shan, god of the Xiangyin temple, whom I have enrolled as my general.” Zhang Ying Jing, together with Wang and Ge, then led the Perfected Man to the Tongming Hall to pay court to the Jade Emperor. Zhang Xu Jing again reported: “I Zhang Xu Jing, together with the immortals Wang Fang Ping and Ge Xian Weng, and the Scarlet-Robed Envoy, have brought Sa Shoujian from the Western River to kneel before the Celestial Pivot, humbly requesting the Emperor to confer his title and office.” The Jade Emperor said: “Sa Shoujian’s merit and cultivation are complete; now that he is named Perfected Man, he shall take charge of the Celestial Pivot, overseeing the celestial registers and attending before me.” Sa the Perfected Man thanked the Emperor and then reported: “I have formerly enrolled Wang Shan, god of the Xiangyin temple, as my general. He now awaits the imperial decree outside the Three Heaven’s Gate. What office shall he receive? I humbly ask for the imperial mandate.”

The Jade Emperor, hearing this, issued a proclamation: “Since Sa Shoujian has enrolled Wang Shan as his general, both shall receive the office of Spirit Official, and shall be forever entrusted with their commissions.” Sa the Perfected Man again expressed his thanks. Thereupon, Celestial Master Zhang and the immortals Wang and Ge, together with the Perfected Man, descended from the Tongming Hall; the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden each held banners, canopies, and precious parasols, and escorted the Perfected Man into the Celestial Pivot Palace. All the immortals assembled to offer congratulations.

At that time the Perfected Man was dead in Yongtai Temple; the monks prepared a coffin and buried him. Later, his corpse was no longer seen. It was known that the Perfected Man’s body was resolved and he departed. I commend this affair, and therefore compose the Record of the Incantation Date.
