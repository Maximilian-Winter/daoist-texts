# Chapter Four: On True Emptiness, the Teachings of Master Sun; Seeking the Great Way, Ma Yu Visits an Enlightened Master

Heaven itself is empty, earth itself is empty, and human life is but a dim vapor within them.

The sun is empty, the moon is empty, who then is the agent of their rising in the east and setting in the west?

Fields are empty, lands are empty, how many masters have changed therein?

Gold is empty, silver is empty, after death, have they ever remained in one’s hand?

Wives are empty, children are empty, on the road to the Yellow Springs they do not meet.

In the morning one goes westward, at evening one goes eastward, human life is like the bee gathering flowers.

After gathering the nectar from a hundred flowers to make honey, in the end all the toil is but emptiness.

It is said that Wang Chongyang came to Ninghai County in Dengzhou Prefecture, Shandong, assuming the name of a mendicant for the purpose of seeking those who cultivate the Way. This is not the matter now to dwell upon. It is told that northwest of Ninghai lies a place called Ma Family Village, where dwells Ma Yuanwai, named Yu, a single appellation. His parents had passed away early, and he had neither brothers nor sisters. Alone he took to wife a lady surnamed Sun, with the small name Yuanzhen. This Sun Yuanzhen was comely and grave in appearance, serene in disposition, able to read and study the ancient and recent; she cared not for sewing needles or thread, or embroidered flowers and patterns. Though a woman, she bore the spirit of a man. Whenever Ma Yuanwai had matters undecided, he would consult her, and even a word or two from Sun Yuanzhen would at once dispel his doubts. Thus the two lived in mutual respect, as friends and teachers to each other; only beneath their knees there were no sons nor daughters, and they were now approaching middle age.

Swiftly the light of time cannot be detained; year by year one sees the water flowing eastward.

If you do not believe it, try to look upon the green water chestnuts; the rosy visage of former days is now white-headed.

These few lines speak of time hastening to old age, and the sun and moon speeding by youth. Ma Yuanwai and his wife looked upon each other, near forty years of age yet childless. Ma Yuanwai said: “We two are not far from forty, without offspring beneath our knees; this fortune of myriad strings of cash, who shall it fall to?” Sun Yuanzhen replied: “The Three Sovereigns governed long ago, the Five Emperors established great works, Yao and Shun bowed to each other in mutual deference, Yu dredged the nine rivers to make them navigable; Cheng Tang engaged Yi Yin; King Wen sought out Tai Gong; the Five Hegemons devised their strategies; the Seven Heroes employed their minds; Ying conquered the six states; Chu and Han struggled for supremacy; Wu and Wei served the Han dynasty; Liu Bei called upon the Sleeping Dragon; the Eastern and Western Jin dynasties, their affairs have vanished; the Southern and Northern Wei, the realm is but a dim mist; the Tang and Song to this day, many a wealthy lord — ask now, where are the people? All is but emptiness. From antiquity to now there are tens of thousands of years; emperors and generals number in the thousands; in the end all is empty, swiftly all is void. You and I, husband and wife, cast all past and future alike into emptiness; think of the world as if it had never borne us, as if our parents never gave us birth.” Ma Yu heard and smiled: “Though others be empty, they yet have descendants; but in our emptiness, the root itself is severed.” Sun Yuanzhen said: “To empty to rootlessness is the Great Emptiness.”

When emptiness reaches its utmost, it is the Great Emptiness, neither now nor ancient, like the primal chaos.

If a man but comprehend the principle of Great Emptiness, truly he may behold the Great Hero on the Spiritual Mountain.

Sun Yuanzhen further said: “If we speak of having children or not having children, whether we have or have not, both are empty. In the days of King Wen it was said that he had a hundred sons; today, how many bear the surname Ji? Who are his descendants for ten thousand generations? How many tend his grave? It is also said that Zhang Gongyi had nine sons, two of whom departed; Guo Ziyi had seven sons and eight sons-in-law; Bao Yanshan’s five laurels spread fragrance; Liu Yuanpu’s two sages contended in beauty. These were all men of flourishing posterity, yet how many children and grandchildren remain today? The desolate winds and cold rains, the wild weeds upon the old tombs; clouds of sorrow fill the sky, and weeds grow everywhere — is it not that having or not having all returns to emptiness? Are the lonely tombs and walls all of those barren of heirs? The prosperous city, so dense and verdant, does not necessarily abound in descendants. I think that the span of human life is but a fleeting moment, like a flash of lightning or a spark of fire, rising and falling suddenly; like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow — neither real nor true. A mansion of a thousand rooms is but a resting place for a seven-foot bed at night; ten thousand acres of fertile fields serve only to eat three meals a day. Though there be many delicious delicacies and rare dishes, though there be countless silks and satins, in but a moment, impermanence arrives; in a breath, all affairs cease. Leaving behind many honours and splendours, unable to enjoy them; though there be boundless wealth, it cannot purchase life or death; all is but a vain transformation of a man.”

To manage the affairs of the world, one is ever busied; from ancient times till now, all is but not abiding.

Mistakenly taking the lost path as home, all is but borrowing a mirror to confuse the passing of time.

Sun Yuanzhen then said to Ma Yuanwai: “We shall seek, amid the emptiness where nothing is empty, one thing that is real and most real; we shall accomplish a work neither arising nor ceasing, and learn a method of long life and unending death.” Ma Yuanwai said: “My lady, you speak wildly. Since ancient times there is birth and there is death; how comes there is the principle of long life and deathlessness? From the beginning there must be an end; how can there be an affair without cessation?” Sun Yuanzhen said: “I have read the books of the Way, which teach to refine essence into breath, breath into spirit, spirit into emptiness; so that true nature may endure ever, a radiant light unextinguished — this is the way of long life. If one learns this way, one is a hundred times stronger than those who have children and grandchildren.” Ma Yuanwai said: “Though you say so, how can essence be made to become breath? How can breath be made to become spirit? How can spirit return to emptiness? How can one’s will obtain true nature everlasting? How can the radiant light be unextinguished?” Sun Yuanzhen said: “You must pay homage to a master, then you may obtain this wondrous principle.” Ma Yu said: “Then I will take you as my master, you may impart to me your skill.” Yuanzhen said: “I am but a woman, knowing a few characters, having read some books; how can I comprehend the wondrous principle? If you desire to learn the Way with true heart, you cannot but seek out an enlightened master.” Ma Yuanwai said: “To seek masters and friends is my lifelong delight; but those who cultivate the Way must have root; if without root, they cannot become immortals, cannot become Buddhas; therefore I consider my root shallow, and will say no more of cultivation.”

Sun Yuanzhen said: “Your words are mistaken. All who transform in the world have root; if without root, how can they transform? Only the depth differs. Those with shallow root have incomplete six senses: some with dim sight, some with dull hearing; some crippled of hand or foot; some foolish, deaf, mute; widowed, orphaned, poor and lowly — these are those whose root is shallow. As for those with deep root, some are emperors ruling the four seas; some are honoured ministers governing thousands; some officials and mandarins of fame; some wealthy and enjoying the country, with six senses complete, ears and eyes keen, heart and nature kind, spirit peaceful — these have deep root. The world esteems wealth and rank, and these wealthy men have roots especially deep; if they also do deeds to benefit men and things, their roots grow still larger; they may become immortals, Buddhas, sages, all may come to pass. Therefore root must be ever supplemented, and cannot be fixed as brought from a previous life. If indeed it comes from a former life, what fear is there that it will not be carried to the next? Like a mountain, the more it is heaped, the greater it grows, the higher it rises. Do not say we have no root; if no root, how could we enjoy this great estate, command slaves and maids, and at a call have a hundred obey? Thus considered, we are indeed men of great root.” Ma Yuanwai was one who loved the Way, but was for a time confused; now hearing the clear exposition of Lady Sun, with proper reasoning, he suddenly became enlightened.

He rose and thanked her, saying: “Much do I owe your instruction, which has opened my eyes; but I know not where to seek this master.” Sun Yuanzhen said: “This is not hard. I have seen an old man, leaning on a bamboo staff, carrying an iron pot, with a calm and vigorous spirit, eyes piercing, face full of ruddy glow; he has wandered here for many years begging alms, his appearance growing younger, never seeming aged. I judge this man to have the Way; when he comes, bring him to the house, serve him, and slowly ask of his wondrous principles.” Ma Yuanwai said: “In our great estate we should do deeds of reverence to the aged and pity for the poor; whether he have the Way or not, let us receive him into our home and care for him for life. He will not eat much nor wear much. Tomorrow I will go to visit him — how say you?” Sun Yuanzhen said: “The sooner the Way is cultivated, the sooner one is freed; do not delay.”

Leaving the words of Ma Yuanwai and his wife, it is said that Wang Chongyang after arriving at Ninghai County stayed for several years. By this time his profound skill had reached its subtle and lively place; he could know past and future, secrets of ghosts and spirits, possessed of divine power and complete wisdom, he understood how to transcend the Seven Truths; and it must begin with Ma Yuanwai and his wife, thus fulfilling the words of Ancestor Zhongli who said that one should meet the horse and then prosper. Hence, ever wandering and begging, not far from Ma Family Village, he stayed several years. He had met Ma Yuanwai several times, knowing him to be a man of great virtue; he had seen Sun Yuanzhen twice, recognizing her great wisdom and desiring to instruct the two. Yet it is said that medicine is not given without knocking, and the Way is not lightly imparted; it requires the seeker to bow low and inquire with earnest heart; words are not for utterance. Since he wandered begging for many years, all knew him and took him for a lonely, poor, unsupported old man from afar, seeking alms; who would have known he was a true immortal? Only this Sun Yuanzhen, a wondrous woman and peerless being, possessing eyes that recognize the good, perceived that the poor and friendless old man was indeed a true immortal; she told her husband, and resolved to receive him into their home to serve and seek the Way. Thus the Seven Truths gradually advanced. Among the works of the Seven Truths, Sun Yuanzhen is to be ranked first.

One’s original wisdom is rarely born otherwise than it is; it is not that Yuanzhen’s eyesight is good.

To recognize a true immortal come northward, the sect of the Seven Truths spreads fame.

It is said that Ma Yuanwai, having heard the words of his wife Sun Yuanzhen, went out and said to the gatekeeper: “If you see that old man carrying the iron pot, quickly inform me.” The gatekeeper answered repeatedly. One day Ma Yuanwai was sitting in the hall when the gatekeeper came to report that the old man with the iron pot had arrived. Ma Yuanwai, upon hearing this, went forth from the estate to welcome him. This was the arrival of the Way of Master Wang Chongyang, fulfilling the words of Ancestor Zhongli that someone would come seeking you. But how it came to be that Yuanwai received the Master, is yet to be told; we shall see in the next chapter.

Even immortals must wait for their time; when the time and fortune do not come, the Way does not proceed.
