# Chapter the Fifth: Master Ma Diligently Serves the Teacher with Ceremony; Wang Chongyang Engages in the Mutual Exchange of Wealth

It is further told that Master Ma, hearing that the old man who carried the water jar had arrived, hastened forth to receive him, and invited him with due reverence to enter the house. The old man followed him into the hall, and without hesitation took a seat upon a chair, with an air of grandeur and dignity, and asked with a lofty tone, "What is the matter that you have called me in?" Master Ma replied, "I see that your honourable age is great, and that you spend the whole day begging; this is a heavy toil. It would be better for you to dwell in my house, and I would willingly provide for your support. What say you to this?" Before he had finished speaking, the old man changed countenance suddenly and said, "I am accustomed to begging; I will not eat your nameless food." Master Ma, seeing the old man’s change of face, dared not speak further, but withdrew within and said to Sun Yuanzhen, "That old man who carries the iron bucket I have invited into the house; I offered to support him, but he said he would not eat my nameless food. Clearly he will not stay. Therefore I come to ask you how you will arrange things." Sun Yuanzhen, hearing this, laughed and said, "Have you not heard that the gentleman seeks the Way, and not food; the mean man seeks food, and not the Way? You at once promised him support on first meeting, thus tempting him with food and drink. Can a gentleman be enticed by food and drink? Your words were ill chosen, and you did not hit upon the right spirit. Let me go out: but a few words from me will surely cause the old man to settle quietly."

It was not that the Master was unwilling to remain, but because the words did not accord.

Sun Yuanzhen now went forth with due prudence and management; surely the old man would soon nod assent.

Meanwhile, Sun Yuanzhen arrived before the hall, and after bowing in greeting to the old man, gave him a greeting of ten thousand felicitations. The old man smiled and said, "I am but a beggar; what felicity is there in that for me to be greeted thus?" Sun Yuanzhen replied, "You, honoured sir, are free from cares and impediments, and roam at ease; is this not felicity? You have no anxiety, no sorrow, and are clear and tranquil in action; is this not felicity? In this dusty world many rich and noble families and men of fame and profit spend their days in anxious care, with many worries and perplexities; their wives’ kindness and their children’s love are incessant; though they say they have felicity, in truth they cannot enjoy it, having only empty fame. How can this compare with the true felicity which you enjoy?" The old man, hearing these words, laughed aloud, saying, "Since you know that roaming at ease is felicity, and that clear tranquillity is felicity, why do you not learn to roam at ease? Why do you not learn to be clear and tranquil?" Sun Yuanzhen replied, "It is not that I do not learn, but that I have not found the method. I wish to roam at ease, but cannot; I wish to be clear and tranquil, but cannot." The old man said, "If you are willing to learn, I have no objection to teaching you." Sun Yuanzhen said, "Since you are willing to teach me, there is a pavilion in the rear garden called the Invitation to the Moon Pavilion, which is very quiet. I invite you to dwell within, that we may learn together." The old man nodded assent.

The words struck a chord between antiquity and the present; the Master met a kindred spirit this day.

A friend speaks to a friend who listens; both hearts are truly alike.

The old man, hearing Sun Yuanzhen’s words, was greatly pleased, and nodded assent. Master Ma at once ordered the servant Ma Xing to prepare the Invitation to the Moon Pavilion in the rear garden, to be neat and clean; beds, curtains, quilts, tables, chairs, and stools were all arranged in proper order, and the old man was invited to take up his abode there. Another houseboy named Zhenwa was appointed to pour tea, hand water, and bring meals at morning and evening. Master Ma then said to Sun Yuanzhen, "We have talked with the old man for half a day, yet know not his name; I will go and ask." Lady Sun said, "Great kindness needs no thanks; great virtue needs no name. It suffices to meet with reverence; why must you know his name? To call him 'Old Sir' is a universal form of address." Master Ma did not believe this, and was resolved to ask. Sun Yuanzhen sought to restrain him, but could not, so he went.

Master Ma came to the Invitation to the Moon Pavilion and saw the old man sitting in meditation upon the couch. Master Ma approached and said, "May I ask your honoured surname and name? Where is your home? Why have you come here?" He asked several times in succession. The old man opened his eyes wide and answered loudly, "My name is Wang Chongyang. I live in Shaanxi. Though a thousand li away, I do not hesitate to come here for your sake."

Master Ma was astonished at these words, and said, "Old Sir, you have come here on my behalf?" Wang Chongyang clapped his hands and laughed heartily, "Indeed, I have come here for your sake." Master Ma again asked why he had come for him. What was the ultimate reason? Wang Chongyang said, "I have come for your wealth of ten thousand strings of cash." Master Ma, hearing this, laughed and was angry, and retorted with a stern face, "You have come for my wealth of ten thousand strings of cash; do you mean to say that you want it?" Wang Chongyang replied, "If I did not want it, I would not have come." These words angered Master Ma so that his face turned ashen, and he hastened out.

The Master’s words cause surprise; he plainly demands another’s wealth and estate.

Such a thing is unheard of in the world; the reasoning is hard to understand.

Master Ma went out of the Invitation to the Moon Pavilion and walked apart in thought, speaking to himself: "This old man is without a proper cause; he moves at once to covet another’s wealth. Never mind that he utters it; he is less than a child; what virtue has he?" Returning to his chamber, he sat down in silence. Sun Yuanzhen, seeing his altered countenance, knew that he had again been affected by the old man’s words, and smiled, saying, "I told you not to ask, but you would not believe me, and went to ask. You asked in an unreasonable way, and the old man’s words clashed with yours. You must be more magnanimous, and not imitate a petty person in your understanding." Master Ma, hearing Sun Yuanzhen’s words, was somewhat pacified, and said, "I think the old man is a man of virtue, but now I see he is a covetous wretch." Sun Yuanzhen asked, "How do you see that he is covetous?" Master Ma then related Wang Chongyang’s demand for the family wealth. Sun Yuanzhen, having heard, said, "Old Sir Wang’s desire for your wealth surely has a reason; why do you not ask clearly? There is a saying, 'Thousand years of fields have eight hundred masters.' This wealth is the most public property of Heaven and Earth, only lent to men; those who can use it enjoy it for a few decades or a few generations; those who cannot use it, it is like flowers beaten by rain and clouds scattered by the wind. It passes from hand to hand. Therefore it is said that wealth is the common property of all under Heaven, revolving and changing continually. The poor become rich, and the rich become poor. Who can be the owner over a hundred generations, or the steward of wealth for a thousand years?"

The wealth of ten thousand strings of cash is no cause for boasting; who can guard it forever without loss?

Wealth is the most public property under Heaven; how can one keep it for a thousand years?

Sun Yuanzhen then urged her husband Ma Yu, saying, "Old Sir Wang must have a reason for desiring our wealth. If his reasons be reasonable, it is no hindrance to give it to him. Moreover, since we have no children, this wealth will in due course pass into other hands." Before she had finished speaking, Master Ma laughed, "Lady, you speak easily. Our ancestors moved from Shaanxi to Shandong, enduring countless hardships to acquire this family estate. Though I am unworthy, I dare not give away the toil and sweat of my forebears. Besides, we are yet but middle-aged. If we yield the family wealth to others, how shall we live the remaining years? What shall we eat or wear? Would this not ruin all?" Sun Yuanzhen said, "You are a man, and yet you are so narrow-minded. We give our wealth to him to seek the way of long life. Once we have the Way, then we attain the state of perfected immortals. What need have we of wealth then? One son becoming immortal makes the nine ancestors ascend. How can this but repay our ancestors? It seems that the Way is worth far more than your ten thousand strings of cash."

Gold and silver treasure is as the sands of the Ganges; though wealth be great, it is at last exhausted.

It is not equal to the worth of the merit of the Way; the merit of the Way endures throughout the ages.

Master Ma listened to Sun Yuanzhen’s words and said, "What you say, lady, is not without grace; yet if one fail to achieve immortality, would it not be like painting a tiger and failing, becoming instead a dog?" Sun Yuanzhen said, "Man must have constancy; if a man have no constancy, he cannot be a magician or physician, much less learn to become an immortal. Those who have resolution accomplish their aims; those without resolution never succeed. It depends on constancy or its absence, on resolution or its lack. It is said that immortals were once mortals; only ordinary men who do not apply themselves fail. If you apply yourself with single-hearted purpose, the result will naturally be as you seek and desire. Which of the immortals or buddhas of old was not once a mortal? Were they born divine on the earth? This is why." Master Ma heard these words and nodded approval.

On the morrow he came to the Invitation to the Moon Pavilion to see Wang Chongyang, and said, "Old Sir, yesterday you said you desired my family wealth, but I do not know for what purpose you desire this money." Master Wang, with serious countenance, answered, "My purpose is to summon all those who cultivate and seek the Way throughout the world, that here they may cultivate and carry on the Way. Your wealth will be employed in supporting their nurture and the protection of the Way, so that they may be free from external burdens, and nourished within. When they come, they will come in peace and joy, and dwell together in gladness." Wang Chongyang spoke his true intent to Master Ma. Master Ma, hearing this, was pleased at heart, but whether to give away the family wealth or not, must yet be told in the next chapter.

To forsake self and follow others’ affairs—

Such are the marks of one who transcends the world, the great and holy man.
