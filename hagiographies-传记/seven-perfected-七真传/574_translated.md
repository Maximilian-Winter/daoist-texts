# Chapter Six: Sun Yuanzhen Urges His Husband to Relinquish the Family Estate; Ma Wenkui Accepts a Bribe and Adapts with Expediency

It is related that Master Chongyang expounded to Ma Yu the intent of “borrowing wealth to protect the Way and gather those who cultivate the practice.” The gentleman Ma Yu was pleased and said to the Master, “You, venerable sir, thus declaring, are indeed a man of great virtue. My wife, Madam Sun, and I both desire to take you as our teacher. Pray, what say you to this?” Chongyang replied, “So long as you and your wife sincerely cultivate the Way, I have no objection; but you must first relinquish your family estate, then I may transmit to you the highest truth, so that your mind may be undivided and free from constant ties and cares.” Ma Yu said, “If you, venerable sir, require silver, by all means use it; I am not miserly. Why must I relinquish?” Wang Chongyang answered, “If you do not relinquish, it remains yours, and I cannot be free and at ease.” Ma Yu said, “The fields lie without, the silver within; I will bring the deeds and accounts and deliver them to you—this shall be relinquishment.” The Master Chongyang said, “Let the deeds remain with you, only ask the clan elders to vouch for it. Draw up a paper of relinquishment, and that shall suffice as evidence.” Ma Yu’s count changed from joy to concern.

Having taken leave of the Master, he returned to the upper chamber and related Chongyang’s words to Sun Yuanzhen. He added, “In my view, this matter is not proper.” Yuanzhen said, “How so?” Ma Yu answered, “Does my wife not know the hearts of our clan folk?” Yuanzhen said, “Each has his mind; how can all be alike?” Ma Yu said, “Among our clan folk, seeing that we, husband and wife, have no posterity, each one desires to divide the inheritance; they wait only for our death, that the family estate and fields may fall to them. How could they consent to my relinquishing the family estate to another? That is why I say it is improper.” Sun Yuanzhen said, “This is not hard; tomorrow summon some capable clan elders to deliberate. If they consent, so be it; if they do not agree, you may do thus and so, and they will surely consent. I promise the matter will be accomplished.” Ma Yu laughed and said, “My wife indeed has talent; this matter will mostly succeed.” He forthwith sent Ma Xing to summon the elders, bidding them appear before noon the next day. Ma Xing went to summon the elders, and there is no need to relate further.

On the morrow, the clan elders arrived, accompanied by some brothers of their own rank and younger nephews, all expecting there would be tables and seats for eating and drinking. Presently these men entered the hall and sat according to their ranks. Among them, one of the highest in rank was Ma Long, a tribute student. Ma Long asked Ma Yu, “You have summoned us; what is your business?” Ma Yu said, “My grandson in recent years has been often ill, hardly well two days in three; one man cannot manage a hundred affairs, and my grandson’s wife often causes my old age to be troubled, difficult to manage affairs. Now there has come a Master Wang from Shaanxi, a man of sincerity, whom I have kept at home. I intend to entrust the family estate to him for management, and for my wife and me to live a life of leisure. He says that this is fitting. He asks that I summon the clan elders to draw up a paper of relinquishment with him; thus I have summoned you elders to deliberate, that you may consent to a paper of relinquishment to him.” No sooner had Ma Yu ceased speaking than a paternal cousin named Ma Ming was angered. Ma Ming rose and pointed at Ma Yu, saying, “Are you mad? Foolish? Nonsense! The ancestral estate must be preserved; how can it be relinquished to another? Who has ensnared you, entrapped you in such a scheme, to speak these unsound words?” Ma Yu, perceiving his argument to be untenable and noting his anger, dared not speak further.

There was a paternal uncle Ma Wenkui, a student of the Confucian learning, and a paternal cousin Ma Zhao, a student at the Imperial Academy. These two literati were outstanding talents among the Ma clan; for all matters great or small, the decision rested upon these two, and the matter could be settled or unsettled by their single word. Ma Wenkui was a man skilled in expediency. Seeing Ma Ming rebuke Ma Yu, he said casually, “Do not blame him. You gentlemen are honest men; blaming him profits nothing. Send for that Master Wang to appear, that I may question him and learn his reasons.” Having said this, he bade Ma Xing summon the Master. Ma Xing soon returned with the Master before the hall. The Master made no obeisance to others, and the others paid him no heed. Ma Ming laughed upon seeing him, saying, “I thought he would be a Master Wang, but it is but a begging old man.” Ma Wenkui addressed Master Chongyang, saying, “You, old sir, have begged in our region for years. I know not of any ability you possess. Our Ma Yu has taken you into his house, clothed and fed you sufficiently. You ought now to live quietly to the end of your days. Why do you deceive my nephew, telling him to relinquish his family estate to you? You, being five or six decades old, surely understand reason; how dare you utter such words without shame and not fear the scorn of men?”

When Ma Wenkui had finished, Master Chongyang replied, “I have no ability, but I fear poverty; hence I asked him to give me his estate that I might enjoy a few years of happiness, let them scorn or not.” Before he had finished, Ma Futian and Ma Gui jumped forward and spat several times upon Master Chongyang’s face, saying, “You shameless old fellow! A crooked-mouthed wench longing for a phoenix crown; a yellow weasel coveting swan’s flesh! You have lived these decades in vain, speaking such shameless words, making one angry indeed.” Ma Fu said to Ma Gui, “Let us not quarrel; just drive him out of the village—that is a good plan.” They made to seize him, when Ma Zhao came forward and blocked them, saying, “No need to expel him; pity the old loner. Our Ma Yu has kept him; let him have his way. Only do not let Ma Yu relinquish the estate.” Ma Fu and Ma Gui refrained from violence. Ma Yu whispered something in the ear of Ma Long, who thereupon said to the assembly, “You children, do not make a disturbance; each go home. I have my own resolve. I will not allow him to relinquish, and he dares not do so!” Ma Long was an elder of the Ma clan; who would dare disobey him? Thus all returned to their homes.

Ma Yu secretly detained Ma Long, Ma Wenkui, and Ma Zhao, inviting them to the study to sit down. He entertained them with wine and food. The old tribute student sat at the head; Ma the scholar sat below to accompany him; Ma the academy student on the left; Ma Yu on the right. No need to speak of the servants passing cups and bowls, of the raising of cups and pouring of wine, of delicate and delicious dishes. After three rounds of wine, Ma Yu rose and said, “Our third ancestor and second uncle and elder brother are all here. I, Ma Yu, have a matter of the heart to discuss with third ancestor and second uncle.” The scholar said, “Speak freely; we shall all consider it.” Ma Yu said, “Do you think I truly intend to relinquish the family estate to Wang Chongyang? Nay, I only desire to let him watch over it for a few years, so that I may enjoy leisure.” Ma Zhao said, “It is no matter to let him watch over it; why need there be any paper of relinquishment?” Ma Yu said, “Brother, you do not know. This is but a temporary expedient, to make him truly sincere in watching over it, so that I may rest assured and he may not neglect it.” Ma Wenkui said, “Your reasoning I do not understand; please explain slowly.” Ma Yu said, “Second uncle, listen well. It is because I am often ill, and my niece-in-law is often dizzy and cannot manage affairs well, that I wish to find a loyal and honest man to manage for me. Fortunately, as Heaven wills, this Master Wang has come, a man exceedingly loyal and honest. I wish to entrust him with the family estate, and told him to manage it well, as if it were his own home, with no divided heart. The old gentleman would not hear of this; he asked me, ‘You bid me treat this estate as my own; do you mean to relinquish it to me?’ My son, he spoke this foolish talk, and I answered him as he spoke, ‘If I relinquish it to you, I relinquish it to you; what then?’ Clearly a jest, but he believed it earnestly and asked me to summon the clan elders to draw up a paper of relinquishment. I thought him a lonely man without kin or friends; I could relinquish it to him, yet he could move nowhere else; besides, being advanced in years, how many years more might he live? So I would draw up a paper of agreement, to please him, that he might manage with single-hearted zeal, and I might enjoy leisure and tend my illnesses. When he dies, the estate still returns to me; what harm is there? I hope, second uncle, you will act as arbiter for me and bring this to pass.”

The scholar said, “Among the clan there are many; I cannot decide. Let us ask your third ancestor what he says.” Before Ma Wenkui could speak, the old tribute student Ma Long shook his head and said, “I care not for the second generation; I cannot decide. Let us see what Ma Zhao says.” The academy student said, “With the clan elders present, how dare I presume to be master?” Ma Yu, perceiving that empty words would not suffice, withdrew within. He took forth a certain treasure, and waving it before their eyes, he ensnared them, so that they could not but acquiesce. What was this treasure, you ask?

It was dense, hard, and firm; with it, all things could be done.

Brightly shining, round and square, no other means so efficacious.

Ma Yu presented this treasure to the three, who, obtaining it, had their eyes closed in a smile and were compelled to recant. The tribute student then said to the scholar, “Ma Yu spoke clearly just now; the borrowing of the relinquishment paper binds that old man’s heart, so he may faithfully manage the household affairs; this is no harm.” The scholar said, “Though it be a temporary expedient, all must join in.” The academy student said, “So long as third ancestor and second uncle consent, I will see to the appeasing of the others.” Ma Wenkui said, “Failing that, I and your third ancestor will decide, but I know not how you will appease the multitude.” Ma Zhao whispered something in his ear; Ma Wenkui rejoiced and said, “Excellent, excellent! With such a plan, why fear their discontent?” He thereupon rose and said to Ma Yu, “Rest assured; it shall be accomplished. But how the relinquishment paper is to be drawn, that shall be explained in the next chapter.”
