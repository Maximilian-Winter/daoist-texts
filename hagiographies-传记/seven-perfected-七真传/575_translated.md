# Chapter Seven: The Bribing of the Clan Head Ma Yu to Establish the Covenant, and the Transmission of the Profound Art of Chongyang by Quanzhen

The flowing stream rushes on without pause or stay,  
From the towering precipice it lets all go away.  

Entangled by name and gain as by a net,  
Without a single thread, there is no demon to fret.  

It is told that Master Ma Yuanwai employed the words of Sun Yuanzhen to bribe the three concerned persons within the clan. Ma Wenkui thereupon caused Ma Zhao to say to the clan: “Ma Niu’s words concerning the relinquishment of family property is indeed a stratagem.” The clan inquired: “What stratagem is this?” Ma Zhao answered: “’Tis a device to leave the tiger to guard the mountain.” The people asked further: “What is the meaning of this stratagem?” Ma Zhao replied: “Ma Yu, desiring ease and leisure, thinks to keep that old man merely as a steward of the wealth.” The clan again questioned: “How can it be known that the old man is to be kept as steward?” Ma Zhao said: “Ma Yu sees that the old fellow is a loyal and honest man, and would have him manage the estate; yet fearing the old man will not apply himself, he feigns to give the property to him; the old man believes it to be true, and demands the deed of relinquishment. Ma Yu intends not to give him a written covenant, but fears that he will not be diligent in guarding the wealth; therefore he summons us to serve as witnesses, and writes a written agreement, thereby binding his heart, and securing his faithful stewardship. Is this not the leaving of the tiger to guard the mountain?” The clan said: “If it be given to him, it is his own; how can he fail to watch over it?” Ma Zhao answered: “How can it be his, if he cannot take a single penny away?” The people asked: “How is it known that he cannot take a penny?” Ma Zhao said: “He is an old solitary man come from afar; he has no kin; his years are many; he eats little, wears little; when his eyes close, he came empty-handed and will go empty-handed; the ancestral estate remains with the former owner. The old man honestly guards the place for others; is he not but a steward of the wealth?” The people laughed at these words. Ma Zhao further tempted them with promises: “When the old man dies, the property still returns to Ma Yu; Ma Yu has no offspring, and so it will not fail to fall into the hands of our sons and nephews. Now, let the current flow smoothly, and make a pretense of human feeling, fulfilling his wish: I see that the old gentleman is a man of feeling and righteousness. If we make this arrangement, then later, if there be shortage or excess, we may borrow or lend from him. Therefore it is said, ‘To leave a way open in front of one’s face is good for future meeting.’” The clan gladly assented to Ma Zhao’s words.  

Words need not be many; had not private matters been bribed,  
A few words could quell the storm; yet even good words sometimes err.  

It is told that Ma Zhao saw the clan consent, and arranged for the next day to gather all. On the morrow, the clan assembled in Master Ma Yuanwai’s house; the old scholar Ma Long accompanied by Master Wang Chongyang sat in the hall, talking and laughing, gesticulating and discoursing on heaven and earth, in intimate accord. Ma Wenkui instructed Ma Yuanwai to prepare many tables, with wine and dishes arranged; when the clan was all present, he spoke: “The elders and juniors, high and low, all are here; now Ma Yu is willing to relinquish his property to Master Wang Chongyang. Do you consent or not?” These people were all as Ma Zhao had said; not one dissented. With one voice they answered: “We all consent, and have no different words.” Ma Wenkui then bade Ma Yu write the deed of relinquishment, and read it aloud to the people; Ma Wenkui lifted the paper and bade Ma Zhao read it:  

“I, Ma Yu, the party relinquishing, do hereby give to Master Wang Chongyang the estate, fields, houses, silver, money, goods, family servants, menials, maids, furniture, implements, fields, and utensils inherited from my grandfather, to be managed at his discretion. The Ma clan have no dissent; after relinquishing, I may not retract; fearing the lack of witness by word, this covenant is made for proof. Witnesses: Ma Long, Ma Wenkui, Ma Wenxian, Ma Wende, Ma Wenyu. Witnesses: Ma Zhao, Ma Ming, Ma Jian, Ma Zhen. The relinquishing party Ma Yu is truthful.”  

Ma Zhao finished reading the deed, and delivered it to Ma Yu, who with both hands presented it to Master Wang Chongyang. The Master received it, then bade the feast be opened, eating large pieces of meat and drinking large cups of wine. They ate and drank till drunk and full, then dispersed. The poet, reading thus far, sometimes says that Ma Yu was resolute in relinquishing his estate in those days; therefore his attainment of the Way was also swift. A poem runs thus:  

Relinquishing all wealth to seek the Way,  
This day early casting off false thought.  
Leaving nothing behind, how shall one live?  
In time to come, the Way will be first achieved.  

Meanwhile, Ma Yuanwai, seeing the clan disperse, entered the inner chamber. He said: “Had not my lady taught me thus and thus, how could this matter have been accomplished?” Sun Yuanzhen smiled and said: “All things done according to principle succeed.” Ma Yuanwai said: “Succeeded indeed, but how shall we now seek the Way?” Sun Yuanzhen answered: “The seeking of the Way must proceed slowly and steadily. Wait for the Master to rest a few days, then we will go together to pay respects to the teacher.” Ma Yuanwai exclaimed again and again, “Excellent!”  

Leaving aside Ma Yuanwai and Sun Yuanzhen’s planning of the seeking of the Way, it is told that Master Wang Chongyang, with one heart, gathered those who cultivated the Way throughout the world, and here cultivated truth and nurtured nature. Yet fearing that neighbours might fabricate rumours and cause trouble, he deemed it necessary first to bestow some favours, so that all might cherish goodwill, and each partake of grace, to serve his purpose. Therefore he widely practiced expedients, generously showing benevolence; sometimes money, sometimes grain, were given to succour the poor, the widowed, the orphaned, and the lonely. Should the Ma clan have any shortage or excess, he helped to make up the difference. If a man could not marry, he was aided to marry; if a woman could not marry, she was helped to wed. All matters of illness and funerals were attended with due care. Debts nearby were not pressed to be collected. Thus it was as Ma Zhao said, he had words of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore within and without, all was quiet; those above and below lived in peace. At the Master’s summons many gathered to lecture on the Way and discuss the Profound; there was no idle talk, but sense and substance from beginning to end. All were the fruits of benefactions. Those who were in high station or of wealthy families did not withhold benefactions from others through niggardliness of heart. Later readers, arriving at this point, sighed in verse:  

Stubborn niggardliness brings no success,  
Had not the Ancestor Wang bestowed his grace.  
Idle words arise at any time,  
How could peace last through years unbroken?  

It is told that Master Wang Chongyang, having bestowed grace outside and put affairs in order within, established more than ten thatch huts beside the rear garden for cultivators to rest and meditate. When all was arranged, the Master moved into one of the huts in the midst to comprehend the art. One day Ma Yu came with the couple Sun Yuanzhen, knelt together, and sought the Way of the Master. Master Chongyang said: “The Way is the path of awakening, causing men to return to the path of awakening and escape bewilderment. But one must proceed from the shallow to the deep, from the small to the great, following order in practice, before success is had. All who learn the Way must first refine their nature; nature is originally a thing of the prior heaven; it must be refined to become round and bright, then its wonderful use appears. Nature is linked to passion; when nature and passion are aroused, they are like rampant dragons and tigers. If not refined and subdued, how can their rampancy be removed and return to emptiness? The Way of refining nature must be confused and indistinct, unknowing and unknowing, with no man and no self; only by refining thus can one enter the method. The way of subduing dragons and tigers having been accomplished, one must also bind the monkey of the heart and tether the horse of the mind. The monkey of the heart is the cunning of a monkey; the mind is the speed of a wild horse; therefore one must bind and lock them, so that the monkey has nowhere to practise cunning, the horse nowhere to display speed, but both return to stillness and tranquility. The power of stillness and tranquillity can seize the creation of heaven and earth, the subtle principles of yin and yang; if still, all worries vanish; if tranquil, no thought arises. Acting in accord, one is an ordinary man; acting contrary, one is an immortal. One must have no trace of杂念 (mixed thoughts) in the heart; not a single obstacle; empty and hollow; attached to nothing; obscure and dark; not a single thing — what is called without a single thread, without a single speck of dust. This is the great outline of the Way. There are yet deeper mysteries ineffable, only to be understood by heart and mind. When you advance further, I will explain to you.” Ma Yu then took for his Tao name Dan Yang; Sun Yuanzhen took the name Bu Er, meaning “no second,” signifying the absence of dual mind.  

The Tao names being taken, Ma Dan Yang and Sun Bu Er bowed together to thank the Master, then returned to the inner chamber. Sun Bu Er said to Ma Dan Yang: “Before we took the Master as teacher, we were husband and wife; now we are fellow disciples, learning the subtle Way together; I call you senior brother, you call me fellow disciple. Moreover, those who learn the Way must abandon affection, and live separately; you must not come to my quarters unbidden, nor I to yours; if there be matters to discuss, send a maid to invite each other, and meet in the front hall.” Ma Dan Yang said: “I leave it to you; I have no objection; if you are sincere, and I am true, then not coming to your room for a year or a year and a half is no matter.” Dan Yang having spoken thus, bade Ma Xing bring blankets and bedding and set up a bed in the front side chamber; then he took leave of Sun Bu Er and dwelt in the side room. Later generations have a poem saying that their separation into chambers was resolute, and therefore attainment of the Way was easy:  

The great Way does not cling to affection,  
Behold how Ma the Patriarch dealt with his affairs.  
Affection hinders the power of the Way,  
Separation of chambers is the truest heart.  

It is told that after Sun Bu Er and Ma Dan Yang separated chambers, not half a month passed before one day he sent a maid to invite Ma Dan Yang to go together to the hut to ask the Way. Ma Dan Yang left his side chamber and met Sun Bu Er; the two went to the hut to pay respects to the Master and asked: “Master, you said yesterday that nature is a thing of the prior heaven. May we ask, what is the likeness of the prior heaven?” Master Chongyang said: “The prior heaven is the great chaos and one qi, without colour, without sound, unknowing and unknowing; what is there to do or say? To say ‘like’ is not the prior heaven. The word ‘like’ betrays the subtle truth; it cannot be spoken. To say that the prior heaven is like something is to be attached to form. To be attached to form is to lose the rite of the prior heaven. Men say the prior heaven is here; here already is not it. Men say the prior heaven is there; there also is not the meaning of prior heaven. Saying and saying, there is nothing. If you would use one word to judge, do not say one word is the prior heaven, for one word is not it. If you now desire to know the subtle truth of prior heaven, I will set it forth to you in writing.” Master Chongyang, having said this, took up brush in hand to set forth the subtle truth of prior heaven; how he would set it forth and by what method, that shall be explained in the next chapter.  

Nature is originally the most wondrous thing of prior heaven;  
To refine true nature is to refine prior heaven.
