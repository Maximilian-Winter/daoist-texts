# Chapter Eight: On the Marvelous Principle of Primordial Unity; The Non-dual Gate to Rooting Out Demonic Evils

Seeking the path to immortality outside the heart is errant;  
A moon’s image in the water, a flower in the mirror.  

Knowest thou the wondrous principle of the Primordial?  
It lies wholly in the one heart, where it may be proudly claimed.  

It is said that Master Chongyang spoke thus to Ma Danyang and Sun Buer: ‘Nature is originally one thing primordial and perfect, round and compact, brilliant and bright; though named, it has no form, unrecognized and unknown, hard to depict or describe, what is it like? I will now strive to sketch for you a figure; you must be sincere yourselves.’ Having said this, the Master took brush in hand, and first drew on the red lacquered stool a circle ○; then drew another circle; within the circle he placed a dot ⊙. When finished, he said to Ma Danyang and Sun Buer: ‘Can you two understand this principle?’ They both answered in one voice: ‘Your disciples are dull of heart and nature, and cannot comprehend this principle; we beg our Master to instruct us.’  

Master Chongyang said: ‘The first circle is the chaotic void, when Heaven and Earth were not yet divided, when sun and moon were not yet distinguished; this is called “Limitless”. From non-being is born being, and therefore within the circle arises a point, called “Supreme Ultimate”. This point gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all things. The primordial is born of the Supreme Ultimate, and this point is the One Qi, hence called the Primordial One Qi. This nature issues from the Primordial, issuing before the body had its being, abiding after the body is lost. This point of spiritual nature is the root uncreated and imperishable; therefore it is called the spiritual root. No man is without this spiritual root, yet the vulgar are ignorant, and ignorance is self-deception. Deceived in their own nature, they cause wild thoughts to arise together, and the evil and extravagant follow the thought; thus they lose the Primordial, and hear not the Great Way. The sea of bitterness is boundless; where is the shore? Alas! Few there are who awaken to the Way; few the travelers who truly practise. The Primordial is verifiable everywhere; do not ask for the Primordial with the human heart. If with the human heart thou askest for the Primordial, the Primordial cannot be obtained. If relying on the heart of the Way thou askest of the Primordial, the Primordial is before thy eyes. The human heart is the one dark and confused heart of greed and desire; the heart of the Way is the heart of Heaven’s goodness made manifest. When Heaven’s goodness is made manifest, the Primordial is attained without seeking.  

Moreover, one must expel sickness; but this sickness is not of wind, cold, heat, or heat of summer; it is the sickness of greed, anger, pride, ignorance, and love. When this sickness is expelled, a hundred diseases have no place to arise; one may prolong life, attain longevity, become Buddha or Immortal, become sage or worthy. Now I transmit this practice to you; strive diligently to follow it. The way to expel sickness is to remove the root of sickness. Find the root, and the sickness is not hard to remove. The sickness mostly comes from greed, anger, ignorance, and love, and is caused by wine, lust, wealth, and anger. Therefore, the practitioner must first expel wine, lust, wealth, and anger, removing their external influence; then cut off greed, anger, ignorance, and love, removing internal harm; the root of sickness will be pulled out, the sick body will heal itself, then the Great Way may be cultivated, and longevity attained.  

Now, speaking of the character wine: there are those who know the harm of wine to the Way, and swear to abolish it. When they see wine, they still guard themselves with caution; or at the urging of others, or seeing others drinking, the desire to drink arises. Though they have not drunk, this desire arises as if to drink; this is the root of the sickness of wine. To expel it, one must do so at the moment the desire arises; only then can the root be completely pulled out.  

There are those who know the harm of lust to the Way, and swear to abolish it. When they see beauty, they still guard themselves with caution; or upon seeing coquettish gestures, tender charms, or graceful displays of affection, their heart and mind are somewhat moved, and feelings of envy arise. Though they have not had union, this feeling arises as if it were union; this is the root of the sickness of lust. To expel it, one must do so at the moment the feeling arises; only then can the root be entirely removed.  

Thus it is seen that the roots of the sicknesses of wine and lust lie hidden within the heart and mind; the way to remove the roots is first to rectify the heart and make sincere the intention, and the roots of sickness will be cut off. The reason the roots persist is because the heart and intention are not rectified. The heart and intention unrectified, a fleeting thought arises; though one has not drunk, the intention to drink is already present; though one has not united, the feeling to unite is already present. At other times, these thoughts are not present, but the external influence moves the internal; like the moon in the water, when the shore and rocks stir the water, the water moves and the moon moves with it. Though the moon has no substance, its form and shadow waver; the true Way is not attainable.  

He who desires the method to cut off the root, Confucians say: ‘See not what is improper; move not what is improper; see as though thou seest not; hear as though thou hearest not.’ Buddhists say: ‘Forget self, forget others, forget all beings.’ The Dao says: ‘See without seeing; hear without hearing.’ All these may serve to root out the sicknesses of wine and lust.  

As to wealth, it is hard to speak of. Some, because their Dao affinity is not yet complete, make temporary calculations; some, because their families are very poor, seek merely to live. Their circumstances cannot be otherwise. There are still some who take only minor traces and preserve the heart. Others, speaking of outward show, talk of imposing manner, clothing, and food; some speak of fields, gardens, and houses; some of cunning and licentious arts, continually rolling in the profits of business and frequenting the abacus and scales, exacting harshly. They desire name and profit, and yet desire to become Immortal and Buddha. Such as these come to learn the Way—how laughable!  

As for Qi, none is balanced; who has just Qi? Who nurtures righteous Qi? They only manifest all kinds of impure Qi, restless Qi, blood Qi, vulgar Qi; sometimes appearing in the countenance, sometimes striving to excel in speech, sometimes striving to prevail in affairs, sometimes showing prowess in anger. They recognize Qi but not principle; what need is there for vast and heroic Qi! Such persons also come to learn the Way—how laughable!  

For these roots of sickness, to seek their cutting off, Confucians say: ‘Ill-gotten riches and honours are to me as floating clouds.’ Also: ‘Hold fast to thy will; do not expose thy Qi.’ Buddhists say: ‘Receive no blessings or virtue; attain through endurance.’ The Dao says: ‘Break utterly with stinginess and greed; with a kind heart, lower thy Qi.’ These all may serve to remove the roots of sickness of wealth Qi.  

Of these four beginnings, to cut off the roots of sickness, one must rectify the heart and mind. Confucians rely on awakening; Buddhists on realization; the Dao on enlightenment. If one can awaken, realize, and enlighten, then all things under Heaven are seen through clearly.  

Master Chongyang having finished speaking on the principle of removing sickness, Ma Danyang and Sun Buer again asked how to practise sitting meditation. Master Chongyang said: ‘Sit in stillness, forget emotions, stop thought so that the mind dies and the spirit lives. Spread a thick mat to sit upon; loosen belt and clothing; at the hour of the Rat face eastward; sit cross-legged gently; hold firmly the posture of the body; tap teeth and swallow saliva; tongue pressed to the palate; ears listen inwardly; eyes half-open, with lids lowered; let the spirit’s light reflect back upon the lower navel, called the Mysterious Pass. The work of sitting still requires stopping false thoughts; a single false thought makes the spirit impure and yang incomplete, and the work cannot be accomplished. Also one must forget emotions; if emotions are not forgotten, the heart is not settled, and the Way is difficult to attain. The thick mat prevents weariness from sitting; loose clothing lets Qi flow freely. The hour of the Rat is when Yang Qi arises; facing east is to receive the breath of life; sitting cross-legged is to gather and nourish spirit and Qi; holding firmly means making fists with thumbs pressing the third finger, to forget the form. Keep the body straight and spine erect, so that the two passages are clear and Qi is not blocked. Tap lips and teeth to prevent loss of Qi from the ‘double tower’. The mouth is the aperture of Qi; if open, Qi scatters, so it should be closed. The ears are apertures of essence and thus turn to listen but do not hear. The eyes are apertures of spirit; if injured by sights, the spirit scatters. If fully opened, the spirit is exposed; if fully closed, the spirit is darkened; therefore the eyelids are half lowered. The spirit’s light reflected from the Mysterious Palace upon the lower navel is like the sun and moon lighting the creation of all things. Speak little to gather Qi and prevent its loss through the mouth; cease sounds to nourish essence and prevent loss through the ears; empty the senses to concentrate spirit and prevent loss through the eyes. Therefore this is called the True Man without Leakage.’  

Master Chongyang having finished his discourse on the Way, said also: ‘This is the work of sitting meditation, the gate of entering listening. Do not treat it as empty or vain. You must diligently practise, and there will be effects in due time. Do not be negligent and thereby harm your future progress.’ Having said this, the Master gave further instructions. Ma Danyang and Sun Buer understood the meaning in silence, took their leave, and returned to their places, practising according to the method. There soon appeared results, and they thought the Way ended here. For more than a month they did not go to the monastery to seek finer points, but practised solely this method. One day, Ma Danyang was sitting in meditation in the side room, when Master Chongyang walked in. Ma Danyang rose to welcome him, and the Master sat down and said: ‘The Great Way is boundless, inexhaustible in taking, unlimited in use; it must penetrate all transformations, not grasping one end only. One must sincerely face the Way, truly amend faults, then there may be benefit to body and mind. The Way is not attained if not faced; one moment and one word must never leave the root. Every word and every act must come from the heart; be alert and not confused; every thought be benevolent; this is truly facing the Way. If one errs and does not amend and remove it, it is as if sickness lies in the private self; then with the public heart remove the private; if sickness lies in desire, then with the principle heart remove desire; if sickness lies in partiality, then with the central heart remove partiality; if sickness lies in pride, then with the harmonizing heart remove pride. Wherever the sickness lies, there treat the sickness; seek help accordingly; as it arises, be aware; as aware, sweep away; as swept away, it perishes. Naturally the heart is gentle as the spring breeze, bright as stars and moon, broad as Heaven and Earth, still as mountain peaks. Gradually the Qi fills and the spirit overflows, silently revolving the One Source, filling all the limbs. Unconsciously, the Great Way is accomplished.’  

Leaving aside Master Wang Chongyang’s discourse with Ma Danyang, Sun Buer sat alone in his room meditating, when suddenly Master Wang lifted the curtain and entered. Sun Buer was greatly startled, hurriedly rose, and was about to speak, when the Master smiled and said: ‘The subtlety of the Way’s principle, the boundlessness of the Way’s method, the unity of all, the assembly of all schools—this must be done lively and naturally, and carried out spontaneously; then it is efficacious. But you, sitting coldly and alone, it profits nothing. Know you not that solitary Yin does not generate, solitary Yang does not grow? Sitting thus dead, you prevent Yin and Yang from communicating; how can you conceive, and how can you give birth? I tell you, if you want this without that, or that without this—’  

Master Wang Chongyang spoke thus and so, until Sun Buer’s face was flushed crimson, ashamed beyond bearing, trembling all over. He hastily lifted the curtain, ran outside, and sat before the hall. He called to the maid Qiuxiang to quickly summon the master of the house. Qiuxiang, seeing her mistress in anger, dared not delay, and hurried to the front chamber to call Ma Yuanwai. Ma Danyang was then accompanying Master Chongyang in discourse on the wondrous Way, when suddenly Qiuxiang rushed in, saying to Ma Yuanwai: ‘I know not why my mistress is angry; she sits before the hall and calls me to summon the master; she has something to say.’ Ma Danyang bade the Master pardon him, saying: ‘Master, be seated awhile; your disciple will return quickly.’ Master Chongyang nodded slightly and said, ‘Go, go; what happens on this journey, let the next chapter explain.’  

Ignorant of this and that principle, thus arises such and such thoughts.
