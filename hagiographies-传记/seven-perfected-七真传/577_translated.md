# Chapter Nine: Wang Chongyang’s Division of the Body for Salvation — Sun Bu’er’s Anger at the Chief Master

I, in imparting the true transmission to living beings, find it hard to express what is and what is not.

Clearly knowing that the Great Way is not far off, yet if one does not enter with undivided heart, one loses the opportunity.

When Ma Danyang heard Qiu Xiang’s words, saying that Lady Sun was before the hall, angry without ceasing, and wished to invite the gentleman to speak, Ma Danyang immediately said to the Master: "It is my Dao-friend Sun who, for some unknown vexation, wishes his disciple to go and converse with him. Master, please sit patiently a while; I will go at once, and soon return to attend you." Master Wang Chongyang laughed and said, "Go then, go." Ma Danyang left the outer chamber and came to the hall, where he saw Sun Bu’er’s face flushed red, anger uncontrollable. Ma Danyang, putting on a smiling countenance, asked Sun Bu’er: "Dao-friend Sun, why are you enraged? Is it that a servant or child has offended you? As host, you must be magnanimous, and not contend with them." Sun Bu’er replied: "Brother, you know not. We regard Wang Chongyang as a man of the Way, but who would have thought that old fellow so unseemly? Just now he came to my sleeping chamber and spoke many words displeasing to the ear—truly vexing. I will no longer study the Way." Ma Danyang asked: "When did Master come into your room?" Sun Bu’er answered: "Just now." Ma Danyang said: "That is a falsehood. The Master has been in my room speaking of the Way since early morning, not moving an inch, and I have not left his side. The Master is now in my room; when Qiu Xiang came to summon me, she also saw him. If you do not believe me, ask Qiu Xiang." 

Before Sun Bu’er could reply, Qiu Xiang said: "When I went to invite the master, old Master Wang was discoursing on Heaven and Earth, speaking with great relish. After you and I left, I know not whether he was still there or not." Upon hearing this, Sun Bu’er lowered her head in silence. Ma Danyang, fearing the Master had long awaited in the side chamber, said no more to Sun Bu’er and hastened back to the side chamber. 

Meanwhile, Sun Bu’er, full of pent-up anger, only wished to call Ma Danyang forth to rebuke the Master and vent her ill humour. Yet all was in vain; she was sullen and displeased, and returned to her inner chamber. More than a month passed, and Ma Danyang came personally to the thatched hut to inquire of the Master, who said: "Sit down awhile, and I will speak to you." Then he sighed deeply and said: "Alas! Those who cultivate the Way in the world, some cultivate it in their affairs, some in their appearance, some by the day; all miss the mark far indeed, and have no true share in the Way. Others cultivate by the ear and eye, by the belly, by reverence; all acts of striving are not the Way, and lose the substance of true Tao. They cannot be called the Way. The form leaks forth, and cannot be fully expressed. Some approach false paths, some feign cultivation, some are showy and heavy but lack calmness, some have eager minds yet weak power; each has its malady, some too light, some too heavy, none proceed naturally from within. Therefore joy is here, yet sorrow there; one advances an inch and retreats a foot. There is no subtlety of the Great Way, and they are truly ignorant of it. In sum, the human heart is not extinguished, and the heart of the Way is not perfected. The human heart not extinguished means not seeing through worldly feelings: fearing the clothes are not splendid, fearing the food not fresh and fine, fearing reputation not spread abroad, fearing talent not displayed, fearing silver and goods not many, fearing fields and houses not broad—all cannot regard these lightly, and have hearts seeking fortune. Sometimes there is a desire for peace, sometimes a sigh for poverty, sometimes thoughts of luxury. The heart full of selfish desires—this is called the human heart. If it is not diminished, it cannot regard the world lightly and discard it. Common men all possess this true nature; it is the vessel of the Way’s creation, the root and foundation of accomplishment. Yet because they cannot see through the world, the heart of the Way is not perfected. The heart of the Way means to be indifferent: indifferent to having, indifferent to not having; indifferent to beauty, indifferent to ugliness; indifferent to gain, indifferent to loss; indifferent to blame, indifferent to praise; indifferent to birth, indifferent to death; able to regard all with equal lightness—this is the heart of the Way. This heart, when used to cultivate the Way, brings accomplishment; when used to suppress demons, it wastes itself away. Those who cultivate the Way—can they not reject the human heart and preserve the heart of the Way? I only hope that all will develop the heart of the Way and attain the true fruit." 

Without further accounting the Master’s discourse with Ma Danyang, we say that since that day when Ma Danyang’s few words before the hall left Sun Bu’er silent and speechless, she returned to her chamber with dissatisfaction in her heart. If she were dreaming, why had she not slept? And she had clearly seen him enter, heard the words distinctly; how then could he be said to be in the side chamber, unmoved? This perplexed her exceedingly. While she was pondering, Master Wang Chongyang raised the curtain and came in laughing, saying: "The Great Way does not distinguish male and female; without yin and yang, it cannot be perfected." Sun Bu’er bade him enter and sit, but stood at the doorpost herself, and asked: "Master, if you are not sitting in meditation at the thatched hut, what business brings you to the boudoir?" The Master replied: "Because you carry the furnace of creation on your back, sitting solitary in meditation, your qi withering away. A woman without a husband is a resentful woman; a man without a wife is a lonely man. I now plainly tell you, without yin there can be no yang; the union of yin and yang is the true principle. The Matchmaker Yellow Lady urges the drinking with a lifted pot. The lady from the west, the gentleman from the east, they reconcile and are equal. Only because the Yellow Matchmaker is the witness, the husband and wife enter the bridal chamber. The union of the two eights is balanced, the joining of senses, conceiving the embryo beside the body. Ten months’ labour and nurture are sufficient; a babe is born better than others. If you follow me thus, you will stand in the Heavenly Palace before the Jade Emperor." 

Hearing this, Sun Bu’er made no reply; she went outside and overturned the two doors of her room, determined to confront Ma Danyang and seek confirmation. Seeing the side chamber door closed, she asked the servant Ma Xing, who said: "The gentleman has gone to the thatched hut." On hearing this, Sun Bu’er immediately proceeded thither. 

Meanwhile Ma Danyang was in the thatched hut accompanying Master Wang Chongyang’s discourse. The Master was saying where the human heart must be light and the heart of the Way true, when suddenly he laughed heartily and said to Danyang: "Go quickly! Someone comes seeking you." Hearing this, Ma Danyang feared a guest had arrived, and bade the Master farewell. Leaving the thatched hut, he went towards the front hall, and there met Sun Bu’er head-on. Sun Bu’er seized his garment and said: "Go and see." Ma Danyang asked: "See what?" Sun Bu’er replied: "Do not ask; go and see and you will understand." Ma Danyang had no choice but to follow her to the inner chamber door. Sun Bu’er pulled open the latch and called Ma Danyang inside to look. Not knowing the reason, Ma Danyang entered and looked around; the bed and curtains were arranged as before, the trunks and boxes were as before, save that the chair was removed; nothing else had changed. He asked Sun Bu’er: "Why have you brought me in to look?" She said: "To see your Master." Ma Danyang said: "The Master is in the thatched hut speaking with me, what Master is there here?" Sun Bu’er, unbelieving, entered herself and lifted curtains and covers, looked under and behind the bed, searched everywhere—no trace could be found, and she muttered again and again, "How strange, how strange!" Ma Danyang said: "What is strange? This is your Way thoughts not pure, you are possessed." Sun Bu’er said: "Brother, what nonsense! I have no杂念 (heterodox thoughts), only a single mind for stillness. How could I be possessed? The Master came twice into my room, his form clear in my eyes, his voice in my ears, his words distinctly remembered. How could it be possession?" Ma Danyang asked: "What words did the Master say? Tell me." Sun Bu’er then repeated to Ma Danyang all that Master Wang Chongyang had said during his two visits. Ma Danyang laughed loudly and said: "Dao-friend Sun, you have been wise all your life, but now you are confused. This time you are indeed lost." Sun Bu’er said: "How am I lost?" 

Ma Danyang said: "Those who learn the Way must be humble and lowly in spirit, not ashamed to ask questions; then they may advance step by step, each step higher than the last. Accumulating threads into inches, inches into feet, feet into yards, thousands into myriads, the subtlety of the Way cannot be reckoned by numbers; hence it is said the Way is wonderfully infinite. You have now obtained a slight mystery, and think the Way ends here. Each month you guard this one chamber, sitting despairingly and wasted, ignorant of yin-yang principles, unknowing of the mechanism of creation, and not going to the Master’s presence to learn. Because of distinctions of male and female, you have taken to holding notions of self and other. The Master sees you rigidly holding to this method, unable to understand the Way, and wishes to come in person to instruct you. But this is hindered by suspicion, and so your yang spirit appeared in a divided body to instruct and save you. The Master has told me many times that the one yin and one yang is called the Way; without yin and yang the Way cannot be accomplished. This yin and yang refers to the yin-yang of the fire and the yin and yang talisman, not to male marrying female or the yin and yang of governance. This is to say the wonderful principle thus; pity you do not understand. That is to say the profound mystery thus; alas you do not recognise it. The solitary yang does not grow: yang belongs to fire, and too much fire is restless, unable to form the elixir. The lonely yin does not generate: yin creates water, and too much water overflows, unable to form the elixir. This solitary yin and solitary yang are like water and fire that cannot help each other. In sum, those who cultivate the Way must have water and fire mutually aiding, yin and yang penetrating each other, then the elixir can be returned. Saying you carry the furnace of creation means plainly that you do not understand the principle of true yin and true yang: the lonely man and resentful woman are also the meaning of solitary yin and solitary yang! Therefore I clearly tell you, those who learn the Way cannot lack this yin and yang; this yin and yang are the wonderful uses of the return elixir. The Yellow Matchmaker is the true intention! By true intention one comprehends yin and yang, as though lifting a pot to urge good drink." 

True intention belongs to earth; earth contains yellow, hence the metaphor of the Matchmaker. The lady from the west is metal; metal flourishes in the west, hence the name west family. The gentleman from the east is wood; wood flourishes in the east, hence the name east family. They correspond to the two eights, a weight of one jin. Metal is not the son of wood and cannot overcome it; wood is not the son of metal and cannot be born. This is the principle of yin and yang, creation and transformation, and the five phases of birth and overcoming. Those who cultivate the Way must by intention comprehend and communicate, like the matchmaker bringing the two families together, so that metal and wood meet without separation, like husband and wife in harmony. The bridal chamber is the cinnabar court, where metal and wood return. Metal is the corporeal soul; wood is the ethereal soul. Gathering these souls in one place, affectionate and inseparable, clinging close, the soul does not leave the corporeal, nor the corporeal the soul, like a husband and wife. Both correspond, eight liang of mercury, eight liang of lead. The joining of senses is the place of forming the elixir: the soul and corporeal soul depend on each other, essence and qi feeling each other, condensing together as if with childbearing. Ten months is the perfect number. Nurturing warmth is the fire’s time. This means essence and qi condense, refined by the fire’s season, achieving fullness and perfection; the work complete, the babe is born. The babe is the spirit transformed from true qi! This spirit comes forth from the mud pellet palace, ascends to the golden palace and becomes a true person—does this not mean an immortal?" 

When Danyang finished speaking, Sun Bu’er was greatly enlightened. As to what happened next, see the following chapter for explanation. 

Harmonising yin and yang and communicating the true intention, Bodhi’s bright and pure heart traces the footsteps. 

If one would purify the land and explore the profound marvels, the Way lies with the Master, cultivation lies with oneself.
