# Chapter Ten: Teaching the Three Vehicles and Expounding the Complete and True Way — Losing Beauty to Willingly Become an Ugly Person

Having received the true transmission, the Way may be cultivated;  
The wondrous methods of the Three Vehicles are at your command to seek.

Yuan Zhen on that day destroyed his visage,  
Exchanging it for a golden body that endures through ten thousand autumns.

It is told that Sun Bu’er, having heard the words of Ma Danyang, felt as if struck on the head with a rod, breaking through the net of delusion, suddenly enlightened as though awakened from a dream, and sighed, saying: 'If not for the words of Senior Brother, I might have almost missed the great matter. I am ordinarily somewhat keener than you, Senior Brother; how is it that in learning the Way I am yet inferior to you?' Ma Danyang said: 'It is not that you fall short of me, but only because you have not gone to take instruction; hence you are inferior to me. Therefore it is said that cleverness sometimes betrays the clever, many a wise man is his own undoing. In all the affairs of the world, only by learning can one know; how many are born knowing?' Sun Bu’er replied with thanks: 'I will respectfully follow the Master's instructions, and from this time forth I will humbly receive instruction.' Ma Danyang was greatly pleased, and returned to his chamber. After several days, he prepared to go to his maternal uncle’s home to offer felicitations upon his birthday. Having arranged the gifts and informed the Master, he invited Sun Bu’er to accompany him. Sun Bu’er excused herself on account of illness and did not go. Ma Danyang therefore commanded a servant boy to carry the gifts, mounted his black donkey, and set out for his maternal uncle's house.

Without mentioning Ma Danyang’s departure, it is told that Sun Bu’er remained within the room. As Ma Danyang had said she refused to take instruction, therefore she did not apprehend the wondrous Way. She kept this in her heart, and now seeing Ma Danyang absent and all the servants playing outside, she went alone to the thatched hermitage. She found the Master seated cross-legged in meditation, and knelt before him, saying: 'Your disciple Sun Bu’er is dull of heart and mind, not understanding the ultimate truth, and thus twice erred. Yesterday, by the instruction of Senior Brother, I came to know that my former words were the Way. I repent my shortcomings and humbly beg forgiveness, and pray for renewed guidance.' Having spoken, she struck her head several times in succession. Master Wang Chongyang said: 'You may stand up; I will speak with you. The Way has three vehicles; measure your strength and act accordingly. Now I will lecture you; let me see which vehicle you can learn.' Sun Bu’er rose and stood aside, bowing to listen.

Master Chongyang said: 'Those who learn the Way must place life and death beyond their concern; breaking through one character of death, they may become the undying. The Superior Vehicle is the Way of Emptiness and Nothingness, free from all encumbrances, spotless as the bright moon in the sky, a single seedling of spirit able to seize the creative power of heaven and earth, to comprehend the true principles of Yin and Yang; by the method of refinement it can cause the existent to return to the non-existent, and from the non-existent produce existence anew; able to grow old with heaven and earth, to cultivate with sun and moon — this is the Way of the heavenly immortals of the highest order. The Middle Vehicle is that of reverent sincerity and fasting; revering the holy and true with ritual prostrations; chanting the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthy; reciting the secret texts of the Supreme; with a pure and single thought, all distractions vanish; mounting to the firmament, all spirits are penetrated and illuminated; the spiritual light never dies; the one true nature reaches directly into the void; ranked among the assembly of immortals — this is the Way of the Middle Vehicle. The Inferior Vehicle is the accumulation of merit and conduct; broadly practising expedient means, aiding men and benefiting things; often examining faults and merits; the true abiding will not be obscured; spiritual brightness naturally manifests — sometimes hidden, sometimes apparent, no different from the immortals — this is the Way of the Inferior Vehicle. Measure your ability and choose which Vehicle you desire to learn, and I will impart to you the true secret.' Sun Bu’er said: 'Your disciple wishes to learn the Superior Vehicle, the Way of the heavenly immortals.'

Master Chongyang laughed and said: 'Your heart is indeed great; I fear your resolve is not firm.' Sun Bu’er said: 'My heart is not great, but my resolve is very firm. This body may perish, but my resolve cannot be taken away.' Master Chongyang said: 'All who cultivate the Way must obtain the spiritual qi of mountains and rivers; therefore the choice of place is not to be neglected. The spiritual qi in the eastern prefecture, Luoyang, is now at its height; there should emerge a true immortal there. If you go to that place and cultivate for twelve years, you may hope to attain the Way. Can you go?' Sun Bu’er said: 'Your disciple is willing to go.' Master Chongyang looked at her and shook his head, saying: 'You cannot go! You cannot go!' Sun Bu’er said: 'I abandon life and forget death; how can I not go?' Master Chongyang said: 'Death must be died to some good purpose; if death is without profit, does it not mean life is given away in vain? Luoyang is a thousand li from here; on the way there are many profligate young men and frivolous youths. If they see your beauty, how can they not be moved? At trivial they will mock and deride; at worse, they will surely insult. You are of chaste and resolute nature; would you suffer their pollution? You would rather stake your life to preserve your honour. You seek longevity, yet would lose life instead. Therefore I say you cannot go.'

Sun Bu’er pondered these words for a long while but made no reply to the Master. She left the hermitage and went to the kitchen, sending all the cooks away. She herself kindled the fire, poured a jar of clear oil into the pot, and when the oil boiled, she took a bowl of cold water in her hand and with her face towards the pot and eyes tightly closed, she resolved in her heart and poured the cold water into the pot. The boiling oil met the cold water and burst forth, splashing her whole face with spots of oil, and where the oil touched, it burned and blistered her skin. Enduring the pain, Sun Bu’er came to see the Master and said: 'Does this appearance now allow me to go?' Master Chongyang saw it and clapped his hands, laughing: 'Excellent! Excellent! There are indeed people of such great resolve in the world; my journey to Shandong is not in vain.' Having said this, the Master imparted to Sun Bu’er the wondrous principles of yin and yang, the mysteries of creation, the work of refining yin into yang, transcending the mundane and entering the sage, imparting all these teachings to her. When finished, he said: 'The great Way is hidden in ignorance and unawareness. The work of ignorance and unawareness must wait upon some degree of madness and frenzy, to conceal it from men, so that men do not know I have skill, nor perceive I have cultivation. When the great work is accomplished, then the body may appear and the Way be expounded. When the oil blisters upon your face have healed, go forth to Luoyang; there is no need to bid me farewell. When your cultivation is complete and your fruit full, we shall meet again at the Peach Banquet.'

When the Master finished speaking, he closed his eyes and was silent. Sun Bu’er bowed several times towards the Master, then left the hermitage. Just then the servants and maids came in from outside and, encountering her, were greatly astonished. Had she not worn the same clothes, they would hardly have recognized her. When asked why she appeared thus, Sun Bu’er said: 'I wished to make some oil cakes with Master Chongyang, but feared you might be unclean; therefore I sent you all away and did it myself. In error I poured cold water into the hot oil, and in an instant could not avoid the splash; hence my face is covered with blisters, but this is a temporary misfortune, not serious; you need not be alarmed. Each attend to your own affairs and do not trouble yourselves with me.' Having said this, she returned to the inner chamber and shut the door, silently pondering the skills the Master had imparted, and began to practise them one by one. The secret formula and wondrous words she rehearsed anew.

After two days, Danyang returned and on entering was told by the servants of Sun Bu’er’s face burned and disfigured by hot oil. Ma Danyang sighed deeply, first visiting the hermitage to see the Master, then going to the upper room to meet Sun Bu’er. Seeing her face covered with blisters, now burst and festering, yellowish fluids flowing, transforming a face as fair as a flower or jade into a visage of a ghost, Ma Danyang could not help but sigh. He called out: 'Comrade Sun, why were you not careful and allowed yourself to be burned so? You might have been lost!' Before he finished, Sun Bu’er opened her eyes wide and looked at Ma Danyang, laughing heartily without ceasing. She stepped forward, seized Ma Danyang’s hand, and said: 'Are you a servant of the Queen Mother of the West? She has sent you to invite me to the Peach Banquet; today I shall go with you to the Heavenly Palace. Let us go quickly!' Having spoken, she climbed on the table and grasped the window lattice as though about to ascend; suddenly she slipped and fell to the ground, groaning without end. Ma Danyang hurried to support her; she wept and laughed together. Seeing her in such a state, Ma Danyang’s heart was full of sorrow. He returned to the hermitage and asked the Master: 'My comrade Sun seems mad with longing for immortality; what is to be done?' Master Chongyang said: 'Without madness and frenzy, who can become an immortal?' As Ma Danyang wished to inquire further, the Master had already closed his eyes and entered meditation, paying no heed. Ma Danyang, seeing this, had no choice but to leave the hermitage and returned to the hall, heavy of heart.

Meanwhile, Sun Bu’er, left alone, was free from disturbance and able to practise well, achieving the round brightness of her nature-body, marvellous beyond words, her heart clear and bright. Finding many benefits to her understanding of the Way, she was greatly pleased. Taking a water chestnut-shaped mirror, she looked at her face and was startled to see scars all over, red and black intermingled. A month having passed without combing or dressing, her hair was dishevelled and wild, resembling a hairy demon, plainly a Jiu Pantu, a living yaksha. No longer the refined lady. Looking upon herself, she rejoiced greatly, and said to herself that now she could go to Luoyang! She tore her clothes helter-skelter and rubbed some coal dust upon her face. Running out before the hall, she laughed thrice, causing all the maids, servants, and boys in the household to come running and surround her. Seeing them approach, she went outward; the maids tried to seize her, but she bit wildly with her mouth. One intimate maid held fast to her clothes, but Sun Bu’er turned and bit her hand, drawing blood. The maid released her hold and she escaped. The servants, seeing her fierce nature, dared not pursue. Hastily, a report was sent to the master of the household. Ma Danyang, seated in the side chamber meditating, heard the noise outside and quickly rose to look. The servants reported: 'Madam Sun has gone mad and rushed outside.' Ma Danyang, fearing a mishap, ordered the servants to pursue swiftly, and followed after them.

Sun Bu’er went straight out of the estate, and those guarding the gate could not stop her. The people within the estate, not recognizing her, let her pass. Knowing that pursuers would come, she saw a pile of wild grass outside the village and plunged into it. Indeed, she saw Ma Danyang and the household coming after her. After going a short distance, she turned back and returned by the same road. Watching them depart, she then emerged and travelled southeast. By day she begged in the villages; by night she lodged in old temples; always to places desolate and remote, under great trees and hanging rocks, places to shelter from rain. If anyone asked her, she answered with words from heaven and earth, nonsense mixed with weeping and laughter. Observing her thus, people knew she was mad and left her unbothered. Thus, on the road she passed in safety, asking the way of upright men; in less than two months, she reached Luoyang. Whether she attained immortalhood and the Way or not, we shall see in the next chapter.

A single leaf of a small boat sails the great sea,  
Ten thousand fathoms of billows without a tremor.
