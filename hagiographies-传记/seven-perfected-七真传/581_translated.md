# Chapter Thirteen: The Disciples Depart from the Altar; The Master and His Disciples Journey Southward in Changed Attire

Men of the world lament, unawakened to emptiness,  
Bewitched by flowers and wine, they vaunt themselves as heroes.  

The long hours of the spring night hasten pleasures,  
Yet the years advance, urging death's limit near.  

Craftiness is like a cat that hunts the mouse,  
Time like an arrow flown from a bow.  

Unaware, the spirit is utterly spent;  
Willing to lay this body buried in the earth.  

It is said that Qiu Qifa, finding his senior brothers and fellow disciples absent from the front hall, surmised they must be in the rear listening to the Master discoursing on the Way. He then proceeded to the thatched hermitage, where indeed he saw the Master seated and expounding the Dharma, while the disciples stood in order on either side. He did not enter within, but stood outside the door, cleansing his ears and quietly listening. He heard the Master say:

"To cultivate the mind in practice, refinement lies within refinement. If there is one selfish thought, there is a speck of dross within the heart; if there is one desire, there is a great demon obstruction in the mind. For when selfish desires arise, one loses the primordial state. One must rid oneself of selfish desires to preserve the primordial. The primordial is the One Qi; when selfish desire rises, fire is set in motion; when fire moves, the Qi disperses. When the Qi is dispersed, what primordial remains? How can the fire’s time be rightly discerned? When selfishness is heavy, Qi is exhausted; how then to renew the spiritual mechanism? When desires are extreme, Qi is dried up; how then to attain the profound mystery? Such is the principle. Should selfish thoughts be removed or not? Should desires be removed or not? Should false thoughts be removed or not? Those who have selfish thoughts, hear my words and beware! Those who have desires, beware! Those who have false thoughts, beware! Above all, cultivate the mind to become calm and unmoving; then thoughts can be extinguished. When thoughts are extinguished, selfishness is exhausted; when selfishness is exhausted, desires are purified; when desires are purified, Yang is pure, and Yin disappears. True immortals and great Buddhas all attain their state from this place of thought, all begin at the place of the mind. Do not think this merely idle talk."

Master Chongyang had reached the subtlety of his teaching, when Qiu Qifa, forgetting his form and place, unwittingly uttered a word of approval. The Master turned to the disciples and said, "One who speaks the Way within the gate, while another listens without,—pray, who is the one who understands?" After speaking, Ma Danyang looked outside and seeing Qiu Qifa, bade him enter. The Master, on seeing him, was angered and said to Ma Danyang, "I have already instructed you to send him away; why is he still here?" Before he finished speaking, Liu Changsheng, Hao Taigu, Wang Yuyang, and Tan Changzhen all advanced and said, "Since Qiu Qifa has come to pay respects and seek the Way, we hope the Master will take pity and receive him among your disciples, so that he may receive instruction morning and evening." The Master replied, "It is not that I refuse to receive him, but I fear his heart is not earnest; if he meet with even a single hardship, he will harbor regret and turn back. At that time, the Way will not be cultivated, but rather guilt will be invited. Better not to take him in at all." Liu Changsheng and the others earnestly entreated, while Qiu Qifa knelt on the ground and would not rise. The Master said, "Since you have repeatedly recommended him, am I to refuse altogether? If you watch over him thus, I will accept him and give him a Daoist name: Changchun." Qiu Qifa then rose, performed three kneelings and nine kowtows, paid respects to the Master, and bowed to the assembly. The Master descended from his seat, and all returned to their places.

More than a month later, the Master instructed Ma Danyang to summon all the fellow disciples to the inner hall. This time, the teaching was to be given on a platform set up outside the hermitage. Ma Danyang received the Master’s words and went to make the arrangements. Presently the assembly gathered, well attired and adorned, with solemn manners, all proceeding before the hermitage to invite the Master to take his seat and preach. Master Chongyang came forth from the thatched hut and took his seat. Sitting upright and composed for a long while, he said:

"I teach with stillness as the principal. The character 'stillness' (jing), above, may be contemplated as the source of transformation and nurture; below, it embraces all phenomena. I will expound this character 'stillness' to you. Not only is it applicable in cultivation and awakening to the Way, but it is also indispensable in regulating family and governing the state! The single word 'stillness' contains inexhaustible subtle principles. Many speak of stillness, but few truly know stillness; hence, though they desire stillness, they cannot attain it. This is because they have not yet discovered the root of stillness. The root of stillness first requires viewing the empty world; the gate of stillness requires cutting off effort from the place of unrest; the consummation of stillness lies in its constant application. Guard the subtle method: when thoughts arise, immediately extinguish them; when extinguished, they arise again; do not allow them to arise; when they arise, immediately extinguish; cause them to be extinguished forever. At the utmost stillness, unrest is itself stillness; there is no speech of stillness, no speech of unrest. To rest in supreme goodness, there is nothing beyond stillness. Such stillness is like Mount Tai before it falls, calm and unshaken. Not because it is calm, but as if it had not yet fallen! Facing a beauty, unmoved — not because of the presence, but as if not yet present. As for actions and conduct, dealings with men and things, the power of this composed stillness appears naturally, though its cause is not known. Parents see it in a stubborn child and are compassionate; brothers see it in a wayward one and are harmonious; wife and husband see it in a quarrelsome one and are compliant; friends see it in a deceitful one and are sincere; the common folk see it in a rough one and are refined; scholars see it in a reckless one and are restrained. By this one is loyal to the sovereign, and loyalty is nature’s portion; by this one loves the people, and it is true love, not indulgent worry. What path is there not to be pursued, what ambition not to be fulfilled? This is not strange, yet the strange is beyond speech. Not only stillness within stillness, but stillness within movement, movement and stillness both still, the Way may be accomplished. The Buddha said, 'To illuminate the mind and see nature,' without stillness there is no illumination or seeing; Confucius said, 'To exhaust principle and nature,' without stillness there is no exhaustion or completion; the Daoists say, 'To cultivate truth and nourish nature,' without stillness there is no cultivation or nourishment. Stillness is the lifeline of the three teachings, not only this. Consider the day without the stillness of night — there can be no basis for the movement of day; consider the seasons without the stillness of winter — there can be no basis for the movement of spring. Thus the Way is founded upon stillness; this is the principle of nature. The Way is founded on nature; abandoning stillness, whence comes the gate?"

Master Chongyang said that this character 'stillness' is the practice inseparable from the three teachings. Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, kings, nobles, generals, and ministers must all begin with stillness before they can be at peace; being at peace, they can deliberate; deliberating, they can obtain. Parents who are still, children become filial; sovereigns who are still, ministers become loyal; brothers who are still, live in harmony; friends who are still, are trustworthy; husband and wife who are still, are obedient. The Master spoke this word 'stillness' to the disciples, knowing well that among the dozens present, only six — Qiu, Liu, Wang, Tan, Ma, and Hao — would be able to concentrate fully on the Way. The rest all began diligently but ended laxly, starting with no proper conclusion, and could not be counted as true practitioners. Soon they would inevitably contend for fame and gain. Therefore, he gave them this practice of composure, so that they might diminish their contrariness and cultivate refinement. Though not transcendents or saints, they might cultivate themselves and regulate their households — not without merit, not in vain for this visit and homage.

Meanwhile, Qiu Changchun, hearing the Master explain the character 'stillness' so naturally and thoroughly, perceiving its many benefits, could not help but soften in heart and dance with joy. But the Master, seeing this, angrily pointed at Changchun and said, "You hear the Way but do not advance; you understand the principles but do not awaken. You merely display your cleverness and bright mind, showing off your wit, unable to conceal or restrain yourself, only knowing how to contrive and cause discord — you are not a vessel of the Way! I have spoken many times, yet you have repeatedly transgressed my rules. I will now avoid you and go far to the southeast, lest you continually disturb me." Then he said to Ma Danyang, "Tomorrow I shall journey southward to seek the Way; only Liu Changsheng, Tan Changzhen, Hao Taigu, and Wang Yuyang shall accompany me; you may manage the home affairs accordingly. The rest may come or go as they please. I shall be away at least half a year, at most a year, before returning."

These words of the Master stirred the disciples’ homesick hearts. Some wished to return to see their parents, some to care for their children. They packed their bundles and luggage through the night, awaiting the dawn to bid farewell to Ma Danyang and to request the Master’s blessings. Ma Danyang could not but escort them out of the village, and all bowed in parting. Ma Danyang returned to the hermitage, where the Master instructed him to take out five sleeves of clothing, five mats, Daoist hats, wicker hats, straw shoes, rock-suspended sandals, shovels, and all other accoutrements. Master Chongyang, with Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan, exchanged their garments for Daoist robes. Taking advantage of the still dark sky, they quietly left the Ma family village. Ma Danyang escorted them beyond the village and returned. There he saw Qiu Changchun bowing to bid farewell. Ma Danyang asked whither he was going. Qiu Changchun said, "I am going to follow the Master." Ma Danyang replied, "The Master cannot bear to see you; thus, he has departed. If you pursue him now, you will surely suffer insult." Qiu Changchun said, "Surely the Master does not truly dislike me, but only wishes me to learn well. If I do not go, would I not betray the Master’s good intentions?" Saying this, he departed. Ma Danyang called after him, "Return quickly, I have words to say to you." But what these were, is yet to be unfolded in the next volume.

Each of the others privately went their own way; Changchun, longing for the Master, hurried after.
