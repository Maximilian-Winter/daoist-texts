# Chapter Fourteen: Testing the Ordinary Mind with Repeated Rebukes; Following the Master's Will and Constantly Holding to Refuge

To cast off evil is like untying tangled threads; the spiritual mind itself has its time of loosening.

If one strives wrongly with a little effort, countless kalpas and many lives will know no end.

It is told that Ma Danyang called Qiu Changchun back and said, “Master, all the elder brothers have changed their manner of the Way; only thus can they journey afar. But you, in your present guise, still wear the dress of the world—how can you go? I have a robe and a Daoist hat; put them on, and then you may depart!” Changchun, hearing these words, was greatly pleased; he immediately donned the robe and put on the Daoist hat, and also took up Ma Danyang’s meditation cushion. Together they followed after the Master. After walking a while, they saw at a distance Tan, Hao, and others walking leisurely behind the Master. Changchun saw some country folk taking their morning meal; he thought to himself, “We rose early and have not yet eaten; it is better I seek some vegetarian food offerings to present to the Master.” Having never sought alms before and not knowing how to do it, he took heart and boldly stood at a doorstep, holding his bowl in his hand. But when a yellow dog barked, someone came out to look, then returned indoors and soon brought out a full bowl of millet gruel, which he poured into the bowl. Changchun was filled with joy, and he did the same at two more houses. His bowl was full; he took it up with both hands and hastened to catch up with the Master.

Meanwhile, Master Chongyang had traveled some distance and rested beneath a large tree, asking Liu, Hao, and others, “Have you brought any travelling expenses?” Liu Changsheng answered, “Because the Master hastened so, we were busy following and have not yet asked Brother Ma for funds.” The Master said, “Since no travelling expenses have been brought, each may seek food as alms; I shall wait here.” Hearing this, the four each sought alms food with their bowls. Master Chongyang sat alone beneath the tree, when suddenly Qiu Changchun appeared, holding a bowl of food as an offering. The Master angrily said, “Who told you to come disturb me? I cannot accept your offering!” Changchun pleaded repeatedly, but the Master paid no heed. Later, Liu, Hao, and the others each brought some alms food for the Master to eat. The Master ate some of the food brought by Liu Changsheng, then declined the rest. Having all eaten their fill, they rose together and walked some ten or more li. As evening approached, they came upon a cold temple by the roadside and entered. After cleaning it, they spread out their meditation cushions and sat in meditation through the night.

The next day the Master and his disciples again journeyed on. Qiu Changchun, walking behind, sought alms food along the way; he came upon a kindly household who invited him to eat. Changchun replied, “I have my Master ahead. That venerable one has not yet stopped; how dare I partake alone?” The kindly host said, “This is no matter; you may go and eat. I will prepare some clean vegetarian food for you to carry in your bowl to offer to your Master; it is not too late.” Seeing the reason in these words, Changchun took his place at the table and ate his fill. Afterwards, thanking the kind host, he found his bowl full of food, which he carried with both hands and hastened forward. Seeing the Master not far ahead, he called out, “Master, please walk slowly; your disciple brings food.” Master Chongyang pretended not to hear and kept walking forward. Changchun quickened his pace to catch up and presented the food. The Master glanced at the food and said, “This is the food of one household; I have no merit to accept it. How could I not ask for a bowlful from a thousand households, and travel alone ten thousand li?” Hearing this, Changchun was silent and spoke no word. In the blink of an eye, the Master moved on. Changchun thought, “To return the food to that kind household would delay the journey, and to eat it would fill my belly. What is to be done?” Resigned, he dragged his bowl along, his hands aching and numb, his body sweating. The elder brothers and other disciples sat with the Master on a stone before them to partake of the meal. Luckily, the food they had collected was scant; he presented this bowlful to them. Each ate a little before it was all finished. That night again they lodged in an ancient temple, and Changchun thought within himself, “My Master is a man of Shaanxi; he does not care for rice, but loves steamed bread. Tomorrow I shall seek some steamed bread to offer him.”

That night he resolved this plan; on the morrow, indeed he found several white steamed breads to offer the Master. Master Chongyang angrily said, “I already told you I do not eat your offerings. Why do you thus persist in troubling me?” Having spoken, he snatched the bowl and dashed it upon the ground, nearly breaking it; the steamed breads rolled down the steps. Qiu Changchun quickly gathered the bowl, put the breads within it, and seeing the Master had gone far ahead, followed after him. Reader, you may ask why Master Chongyang thus treated Changchun harshly? It was because he had begun the Way in youth, unlike Liu, Hao, Wang, and Tan, who had already transformed their temperaments. Unless he was carefully ground and polished, how could he become a vessel? It is said, to grind his natural disposition. Yet Changchun had a deep root, and having received repeated rebukes, bore no resentment in his heart.

Master Wang Chongyang and his disciples journeyed for more than two months. At this time the heavenly Way was cold; they had gathered some bundles of firewood in the countryside. That night the rain and snow were severe and bitter cold. They took some firewood to kindle a fire for warmth. Master Chongyang, seeing this, became angry; he threw all the bundles of firewood into the fire at once. Instantly flames roared and leapt, showering sparks wildly. The Master took the fire shovel and pressed down the firewood a few times; the flames were extinguished, and thick smoke arose, choking them so that there was no way to turn their heads. The temple was narrow, and the wind blew in. Qiu, Liu, and the others could not bear the smoke and were forced to go outside the mountain gate to avoid it. One by one they rubbed their brows and eyes, all saying, “Good smoke, good smoke!” Seeing them leave, the Master shut the mountain gate, moved his cushion to the door and sat blocking it. They stood outside a while, till the smoke cleared, but then the cold returned. They tried to push the door, but could not open it, and dared not call out. They sat under the eaves, when a gust of snowy wind struck them, making them shiver and tremble. Liu Changsheng said, “The Master has taught us the art of fire; why do we not try to use it to dispel this bitter cold?”

Changchun and the other disciples set to their practice, closed their breath and gathered their qi, moving it about. In a short while not only was it no longer cold, but warmth was felt. After a while the day brightened, the mountain gate was opened, and all entered in. They saw the Master sitting upon his cushion, angry and unappeased, saying to them, “Ye fear heat and shun toil, love life and dread death; ye abandon reality and seek falsehood; ye covet a warming of false fire, yet will not move the true fire. Ye seek comfort and have no deep practice. Such idleness, how can ye attain the Way? If I do not chastise you with heavy blows, ye will begin in diligence but end in laziness. Now bring forth the ruler.” He bade Wang Yuyang fetch the disciplinary rod, and each was struck twenty times as a warning for the future. Liu, Hao, and the others turned pale and dared not reply. Qiu Changchun knelt before the Master, saying, “It is my fault alone, and has nothing to do with the elder brothers. I am willing to bear the blame; I beg the Master to pardon them.” The Master said, “If you are willing to take their blame, twenty blows each come to a hundred in all.” Liu and Hao came forward to beg mercy. The Master sighed, “If ye all plead for exemption, how can I refuse? But next time do not do so again; I fear ye will harm your future progress.” Then he threw down the rod and said to Liu Changsheng, “Your mind took a sudden turn and ye resolved to travel south. Now the pleasure is over, and ye desire to return north. At once prepare to set out; allow no debate.”

Having spoken, he went forth. Qiu, Liu, and the others hastily packed their cushions, took up their shovels, bade farewell to the old man tending the incense, and followed after the Master. They returned by the old road to Shandong, and soon arrived at Ninghai county, at Majiazhuang. Qiu Changchun first went to report to Ma Danyang, who hurried out to receive the Master and took him to the rear thatched hermitage to lodge. Here they lived quietly, with no need to advertise. After more than a month, the disciples, hearing of the Master’s return, came one by one to study the Way again, and the place grew lively once more. The Master devised a cunning method to disperse them. How did he disperse them? That will be told in the next chapter.

If one does not dismiss with false intent, how can the true mind come to enlightenment?
