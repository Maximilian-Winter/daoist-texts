# Chapter Seventeen: The Jest of Xi Hong to Secure His Escape — The Difficulties of Truly Embracing the Way of Completion

The mind and its realm must originally be clear and bright; let no single matter mislead the whole life.

In former years, one was everywhere deceived by false men; now, encountering true men, one cannot clearly discern them.

It is said that Master Tan Changzhen, perceiving in Gu Yufeng a certain kindly spirit, wished to enlighten him. But Gu Yufeng, before he opened his mouth, said: 'Daoist Master, there is no need to say more. I am wearied by your words; even if you say them, I will not believe. I am frightened by your deceits. What sort of cultivators are you? To me, you are all but those who mere seek to secure clothing and food.' Having spoken thus, he went indoors and did not emerge again. Tan Changzhen, hearing these words that spoke of the Dao as utterly void of spirit, was moved to revive the ancestral teachings. Looking up, he saw that the sky was already late. He sat down at the village gate, and when night fell, the villagers urged him to depart; they brought a bucket of cold water and dashed it at the gate, wetting him, and then opened the gate.

Seeing their cruel conduct, Tan Changzhen would not approach their door, but sat down by the roadside. That night there fell snow again, piling up more than a foot deep. At dawn, when the villagers came out and saw Tan Changzhen sitting in the open courtyard, with snow piled all around, they marvelled that not a single flake lay upon him. They reported this to Yufeng. Hearing this, Gu Yufeng himself came out to see. Approaching him, he felt a warm aura about the man, and knew him to be a person of the Way. He invited him indoors and received him with the manners of a guest, saying: 'It is not that I disbelieve in the Way, but because there are no good men among the Daoists. Yet your venerable self, so earnestly cultivating, whom would not respect? I am now willing to support you; live here in my house for three or five or ten or eight years, I shall all be pleased. Tomorrow I will select an auspicious day to take you as my master; I wonder if you will consent?' Tan Changzhen had wished to enlighten him, but seeing that he had somewhat awakened faith, though not yet full reverence, how could he refuse? So he nodded assent. Gu Yufeng rejoiced greatly, and ordered his servants to prepare a room behind the house, inviting Tan Changzhen in. There he sat in reverent meditation, receiving daily offerings of tea and food without lack. He also caused the maid Xi Hong to attend constantly with soup and water, so that truly the Daoist’s virtue was noble and his subtle principles boundless.

Time passed swiftly; after more than half a year, Gu Yufeng made no inquiry about the Way, nor sought instruction; Tan Changzhen discerned his intent was not to learn the Way but to be supported by him, to have another make merit and cultivation for him, while he enjoyed the ready-made blessing. Seeing through this scheme, Tan Changzhen declined to remain supported there, and repeatedly sought leave to depart. Gu Yufeng entreated bitterly, unwilling to let him go, and even commanded his household to keep careful watch. Thus Tan Changzhen’s several attempts to leave were all foiled by their detaining him. Unable to depart, he devised a subtle stratagem, for only thus could he escape.

Soon Xi Hong brought tea; Tan Changzhen deliberately grasped her wrist and said: 'Your hand is so white and clean, it delights one exceedingly!' Xi Hong’s face flushed, and she replied with constraint: 'It is as if coated with lacquer, Master, do not jest.' Having said this, she went out. She went upstairs to inform Mistress Gu, who said to her husband: 'Master Tan is teasing our maid; he is not a true cultivator. Let him be sent away.' Gu Yufeng did not believe this, saying: 'This is Xi Hong’s impatience in serving him that has created such rumours.' The lady, seeing her husband’s words, scolded Xi Hong, who dared not speak further.

Two days later, Gu Yufeng saw Xi Hong bring tea to Tan Changzhen, and followed behind to spy on their movements. Indeed, he saw Tan Changzhen hold her hand, smiling with frank delight, saying: 'Your hand is as white as jade, as soft as cotton, truly a delight to behold!' Hearing these words outside, Gu Yufeng was greatly angered and wished to drive him out. Yet he considered that since Tan Changzhen had attempted to leave several times and he had repeatedly begged him to stay, now to expel him would show him to be unkind. It would be better to write some words and post them on the wall, so that when he saw them, if he were sensible, he would depart of his own accord. He only needed to command his men not to bar his way; this would be a good plan. Leaving aside Gu Yufeng’s secret preparations, the next day, when Tan Changzhen sat until after breakfast without Xi Hong bringing tea or water, the stratagem took effect. He went out and saw the notice on the door, upon which were written four lines:

The west wind flies snowflakes day and night,  
Cold sits the mat with figure askew.  
Do not envy today's hands like jade,  
Far think back on days when the body was a frog.

Tan Changzhen read this, smiled, and went inside. Seeing brush and ink on the table, he took the brush and again came out, and wrote four lines on the paper. Having finished, he went inside to gather his belongings, then ran out in front of the hall, calling twice in thanks, but received no reply, and went straight out of the village towards the south. He wandered for two years, then began to return northward; but this is another tale, and need not be told here.

As for the servants of the Gu household, since their master had ordered that Tan Changzhen not be stopped when he left, they let him go. Thus when they saw him depart, each made way for him, and only after he had gone did they report to their master. Gu Yufeng, hearing this, came after him. Seeing the original notice with four lines now appended by Tan Changzhen, what were the four lines?

Speak not of snow, moon, wind, or flowers;  
With a pure heart, why fear a bent shadow?  
No mention of Xi Hong’s hand like jade,  
This body surely shall be a frog in a well.

Gu Yufeng, seeing these lines, knew that Tan Changzhen’s jesting with Xi Hong was but a stratagem to escape, and sighed deeply. Leaving this untold, let us turn to another matter.

It is told that Wang Yuyang, having parted from his fellow Daoists at Da Wei village, travelled to the region of Fangzhou. On the northern road of Fangzhou lived a gentleman named Yao Chonggao, who had served as a prefect of Xin'an You Fu, but, having grown weary of worldly affairs, resigned and returned to his native village, enjoying the fields and gardens. He was throughout his life devoted to the Dao, and when he met monks or Daoists, treated them as if meeting kin; whether they were cultivators or not, he would converse with them. Near him was the 'Encountering Immortals Temple'; its abbot was also a Daoist, and monks and Daoists coming and going often stayed there. He had previously instructed the abbot that whenever a cultivator of superior attainment came, he should inform him; the abbot agreed.

One day came a practitioner who was neither monk nor Daoist, who claimed to be a man of the Way, often displaying great magical powers before men. He said he was ninety-six years old, had met Zhang Sanfeng several times, had also met Lü Dongbin several times, that Bodhidharma was his master, Ji Dian his good friend, and that he could sit in meditation for a day or two without falling. That day, he came to the Encountering Immortals Temple and spoke many words of boundless salvation. The abbot listened and asked his name; he said he was called Hunranzi. The abbot then led him to see Lord Yao. At their meeting, he said: 'Monks are hungry ghosts of lust, Daoists are devils of breath; neither can become immortals nor Buddhas. One must be like me, who can see through all things, unstained by a single dust, and truly cultivate, to live several hundred years.' Hearing this, Yao Chonggao was greatly pleased and took him as master, supporting him at home. This old man spoke without reserve, disparaging monks and Daoists at every turn. At that time, the Daoists of the Encountering Immortals Temple were present, and hearing his talk, they were displeased in their hearts, thinking: 'This old man is most ungrateful. I recommended him with good intent to be supported, yet he disregards our faces, and openly reviles monks and Daoists before us. He knows not that he but uproots the tiles of the house and looks at the people under the eaves. He only seeks Lord Yao’s respect, but belittles us. We must find another able meditator to rebuke this old man and satisfy our minds.' Having resolved this, they left Lord Yao and returned to the temple.

A few days later, Wang Yuyang came to lodge. The abbot, seeing his dignified bearing and noting that he meditated daily with a vigorous spirit, resolved to use him to refute the old man. Fearing he might leave, he contrived a plan, saying to Wang: 'A great cultivator has come to Lord Yao’s house, able to remain seated for over ten days without falling. I wish to visit him with you; what think you?' Hearing this, Wang Yuyang was pleased, and went with the abbot to Yao’s residence. The gatekeeper admitted them, and Yao Chonggao himself came out to welcome them and took them to the guest chamber to serve tea. Before they could speak, suddenly an old man with white hair came in. Wang Yuyang, looking at him, saw that he had thick eyebrows and fine eyes, a nose raised proudly, lips and teeth bared, a square face with long ears, a few wisps of beard, and a few white hairs upon his head, appearing like an old woman. He went and sat on the upper chair. The abbot then said to Wang Yuyang that this old gentleman was the great cultivator he had spoken of. Wang Yuyang stepped forward to salute him. The old man, lofty and unmoved, looked down on Wang with disdain, saying: 'You, fellow Daoist, are you one who plants flowers or one who inserts willows?' Wang Yuyang was puzzled and did not understand. Before he could answer, the old man asked: 'Do you have a wife?' Wang Yuyang thought this a coarse question, and answered casually: 'I do have a wife, but now have left her at home.' Hunranzi laughed loudly: 'You have become a monk in vain, not even knowing these few words. Let me tell you, "planting flowers" means to become a monk in youth, "inserting willows" means to become a monk in middle age. Asking if you have a wife, do you think this is a true message of the yin? You answer with worldly words, which shows your ignorance. If I asked you about pregnancy, you would understand still less.'

This Hunranzi thus openly humiliated Wang Yuyang. Wang paid no mind, but the abbot’s face had already turned pale. Seeing the abbot’s face flushed with shame, Wang Yuyang felt compelled to argue a little to preserve appearances. Smiling, he asked: 'Just now you spoke of the true yin. What indeed is this true yin? You spoke also of pregnancy, but from where does the embryo form? And what is it that is conceived?' Hunranzi was at a loss for a moment, and burst out laughing: 'The mystery cannot be revealed; how can I speak lightly with you?' Seeing the old man insist thus, as if he did not know, the abbot said to Wang Yuyang: 'Fellow Daoist, ask as you will; if he does not know, do not question further.' But what Wang Yuyang said then is unknown; we must wait for the next chapter to explain.

Boasting often in great words, yet when questioned, cannot reply.
