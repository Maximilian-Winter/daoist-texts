# Chapter Eighteen: Wang Yuyang Employs the Genuine to Refute the False — Tan Changzhen Explains the Ancient to Confirm the Present

It is said that in the Western lands there grows a wondrous lotus, its flowers ten cun wide, and its rhizomes like boats.

Upon the Spirit Terrace there stands a Garden of Deities; the native scenery is indeed the realm of the Buddha Heaven.

It is told that Wang Yuyang, with a few words of crucial import, confounded Hunranzi so that he could make no reply. The master of the temple, standing beside, clapped his hands and laughed aloud, urging Wang Yuyang to speak out boldly without restraint, for there was no need to trouble him, as Hunranzi could not understand it. When Hunranzi heard the master say he did not comprehend, he was about to grow angry; but Wang Yuyang quickly explained for him: “The venerable sir is not without knowledge, but unwilling to speak! I, a humble Daoist, dare to lay out this principle for all to study and examine, whether it be true or not. The true Yin and true Yang are the two energies of Yin and Yang. The true Yang energy is stored in the liver; the true Yin energy gathers in the lungs. The liver is of wood, the place where the soul is gathered; the lungs are of metal, the abode of the corporeal soul. Metal corresponds to the Dui woman; wood corresponds to the Zhen man; wood prospers in the east, metal is born in the west. Hence the metaphor of an eastern son and a western daughter. To make metal and wood meet, the soul never leaves the corporeal soul, nor the corporeal soul the soul; as a husband loves his wife, and the wife depends on the husband — this is the principle of the union of Yin and Yang. When the venerable Hunran asked me whether there is a household or family matter in this, it is necessary to borrow the matchmaker Huangpo to bring them together. Huangpo is the true intention; that is to say, one must borrow true intention to bring about mutual understanding, so that metal and wood shall have no separation, and thus be as harmonious as husband and wife. Intention belongs to earth and is full of feeling; its colour is yellow and it is active, thus it is likened to a matchmaker. The east and west come and go, connecting the two families, like a go-between. To be with child is to say that the true energy condenses within the elixir field, as if pregnant. When the true energy is complete, it manifests in the spirit; hence it is said that the spirit is the child of energy, and energy the mother of spirit. Thus there is the saying of the birth of an infant. At this stage, the Great Elixir is accomplished: one may grow old with Heaven and Earth, resting with the sun and moon.”

Lord Yao, hearing these words, praised them without ceasing. Hunranzi, fearing that Wang Yuyang would take away his place, boldly declared: “Where there is virtue, there must be words; where there are words, virtue does not necessarily follow. If you dare to sit in meditation with me for three days without tasting tea or water, then you may claim to have skill.” Wang Yuyang laughed and said: “For many days I could not sit so; but if it be for two or three days, I, a humble man, am willing to accompany you.” Thus saying, the two began to compete in meditation. They spread mats and blankets upon the guest hall floor, and sat side by side. Hunranzi could naturally sit for three days without tasting tea or water; but now, because he wished to contend with Yuyang, he had a little rancour in his heart, and so was not at peace in sitting. He was troubled, sometimes desiring tea or water, sometimes needing to relieve himself, and on that day went several times. By the second day he could not endure sitting any longer, and finally rose to seek food and drink; he began to nod off, and slept with snoring loud enough to fill the hall. Wang Yuyang sat firmly until the third day before rising, and felt the spirit clear and energy refreshed. Lord Yao praised him again and again, saying: “The master’s skill in sitting is beyond the venerable sir.” Wang Yuyang said: “It is not that the venerable sir is inferior to me, but because he is advanced in years, and his spirit and energy have waned. Were I to be at his age, I fear I could not endure sitting even half a day.” Upon hearing this, Hunranzi’s heart was pleased and he humbled himself, no longer proud, and gradually became modest and courteous.

Wang Yuyang remained at the Yao residence for several days, teaching him several portions of mysterious skill, and the two got on very well. One day Wang Yuyang took leave to fetch a scroll from Yuxian Temple, and having gone, was gone for several days, unseen. Yao Chonggao sent servants to inquire, and the temple master said he had left on that day. Lord Yao, hearing this, stamped his foot and sighed long, believing that fate had denied him; Hunranzi also felt reluctant. With Wang Yuyang gone, the narrative turns to Liu Changsheng, who after bidding farewell to the assembly of Daoist friends journeyed southward, then went eastward to Lu, where he diligently cultivated at Mount Tai for three years, achieving the true result, ascending to the higher realms, joining the feast at the Jade Pool, and paying respects to the Queen Mother. Behind the Queen Mother were dozens of fairy maidens, their countenances wondrous and rare in the world, difficult to describe or paint, lovable and enviable. He could not resist a thought, and stole a glance at the fairy maidens. The Queen Mother asked: “Why do you look upon them? What do you intend?” Hearing her words, Liu Changsheng knew he had been discourteous, and in fear apologized, bowing and saying: “I chanced to see the rainbow sleeves fluttering and spreading; unintentionally I cast a glance at the fairy maidens, but truly I had no other intent. I beseech your merciful countenance to pardon my fault.”

The Queen Mother reproved him: “While you still live as man, and your form is not empty, even if your Golden Elixir be perfected, you cannot transcend the mortal to enter the saintly; you must return once more to the mortal world, and toil in bitter cultivation.” She commanded the celestial official to send him down. The southern heavenly official, obeying the Queen Mother's command, led Liu Changsheng to the Southern Heavenly Gate. Just as Liu Changsheng was about to ride the cloud qi down, the official gave him a push, and he fell from the Southern Heavenly Gate. Suddenly he awoke, realizing it was but a dream. Reflecting on the Jade Pool episode, it was truly but a single moment’s error. Moreover, the Master Chongyang once said: “Though I excel in the elixir way, yet my form is not empty.” Now his dream and the Queen Mother’s reproach coincide with the Master’s words; but he knew not how to practice during this period. It was necessary to descend the mountain and seek a worthy one to guide him. Thus he descended the mountain, and after several days on the road, met Tan Changzhen, to whom he recounted all that had happened. Liu Changsheng said: “You do not accept support from your household, and your mind is not crooked; I in the Jade Pool mistakenly glanced at the fairy maidens, yet my mind was not wrong. Now I desire to refine and empty my form, but know not where to begin.” Tan Changzhen said: “In ancient times, when Xu Jingyang was young, he was fond of hunting. One day while hunting in the mountains, he shot a deer; the young deer fled with the arrow. Jingyang and his attendants searched the mountain and found two deer in a hollow. The young deer lay on the ground; the elder licked its wounds. When they saw men coming, the elder did not flee; both were captured. Returning home, after unbinding them, the two deer were already dead. Upon opening the belly, the mother’s intestines were severed; the young deer was wounded but its intestines intact. Thus it is clear that a parent’s pain is more acute than that of a wound. Seeing this, Jingyang’s heart was moved, and he broke his bow and arrows, entered the mountains to cultivate, and attained the true fruit. He desired to transform and save the Ten Powers, then ascended the platform to expound the Dharma, gathering over several hundred disciples.”

One day Jingyang said to his disciples: “You several hundred are not few; you have abandoned your homes to study the Way with devotion. But the practitioner must see through form and colour; can you see form without coveting it?” The disciples all replied: “As to wealth, qi, and wine, perhaps we have not completely renounced them; but as for the word ‘form’, we regard it lightly and do not covet it.” Xu Jingyang said: “Your words are so pure; I fear it may not be so.” The disciples answered: “We dare not falsely speak to deceive Master.” Xu Jingyang said: “I have a method to test your reality. Each of you prepare a piece of charcoal, about two or three feet long, and place it on your bed to sleep with for a night. At dawn, bring it to me, and I will show you the skill that you truly possess.” The disciples, hearing this, not understanding, went to prepare their charcoal to place upon their beds.

That night, a disciple awoke from sleep to find someone beside him. Feeling with his hand, he found it warm and soft as cotton, smooth as jade. Further search revealed a woman’s form. Desire suddenly blazed up; he could not restrain himself, and lay with her. Having discharged true Yang, yet still reluctant, they embraced and slept until dawn. Outside, a shout called: “Come quickly to hand in your charcoal; Master has waited long.” The disciples awoke startled, each holding a piece of charcoal, filled with doubt. Again the call came: “Put on your clothes and come to hand in your charcoal.” Xu Jingyang ordered the disciples to stand in two lines and present their charcoal one by one. The disciples, hearing this, dared not disobey, and lined up. One came forward and presented his charcoal. Xu Jingyang asked: “How old are you?” He said: “I am seventy-six years old.” Xu Jingyang said: “Why, at your age, have you not seen through the word ‘form’?” The man replied: “How do you know I have not seen through it?” Xu Jingyang said: “If you have seen through it, what is that on your charcoal?” Upon inspection, the charcoal bore faint white spots halfway along its length, signs of uncleanness. It was known to be the true Yang discharged last night. Ashamed, the man lowered his head in shame and did not speak. Then, as they examined their charcoals, more traces appeared, and fear of disgrace gripped them; all stood dumb, refusing to present their charcoal, despite repeated summons. Only one laughed and stepped forward, presenting his charcoal with no trace or mark. Xu Jingyang asked: “Form is that which men love; why do you not love it?” The man answered: “I have refined my skill from form.” Xu Jingyang asked how he had cultivated? He said: “Whatever is loved is also feared; at first, fear of non-attainment causes distress; when attained, delight and joy follow, and rest is refused. Yet man’s spirit declines and qi weakens, and he fears for life; hence the fear is great and avoidance necessary. Thus, facing the object, one forgets feeling, cutting off desire to preserve the body. In youth I was reckless and unrestrained, sleeping with flowers and lying with willows, neglecting home for a year, treating the brothel as my own house, having seen many beauties whose numbers cannot be told, and many amorous affairs, which damaged the spirit. Fearing this, I wished to avoid it, but could not; so I fled here to study the Way, to preserve life, no longer coveting beauty. This is no cunning device, but comes from experience and broad knowledge.” Xu Jingyang nodded at these words. He then dismissed the disciples, keeping this one alone to teach the mysterious Way, and in time he too attained the true fruit. Thus it may be said that all matters must be experienced; only by seeing much can one regard lightly and let go.

Tan Changzhen finished telling of these ancients. Liu Changsheng said: “I had no intention concerning inner matters, but was pleased by their outward appearances. One day I shall visit the brothels, to survey all the painted faces, to become well-informed and with wide-open eyes.” Tan Changzhen invited him to the land of Jin, to see the place where the Dao Ancestor was born. The two journeyed many days, and on the road met Wang Yuyang going forward; Wang Yuyang then told them the story of Hunranzi’s discussion at the Yao mansion. Liu Changsheng laughed: “This old fellow is fortunate indeed, stealing away our wonderful Way.” Wang Yuyang said: “Had I not known sitting practice, that old fellow would still not submit.” Tan Changzhen said: “From this it appears that sitting practice is the gate key for those who study the Way; none who enter our gate can neglect it.” The three walked and talked, when suddenly they heard someone calling behind them: “You walk so fast. Who might this be? The answer will be revealed in the next chapter.”

Fair forms are but painted towers, delighting dusk and dawn without rest.

Once impermanence comes, all is ended, and at the night terrace old pleasures fail to flourish.
