# Chapter Nineteen: On the Profound Mystery—Four Words to Contract the Wondrous Way; Opening the Stone Cave—One Man Labouring Alone

Sunk in mire, engulfed in years of woe,  
The river of love rolls with waves that overwhelm the sky.  
The practice of cultivation may raise one to the high shore;  
Why seek again a boat amid the midstream?

It is told that Liu Changsheng and Wang Yuyang and Tan Changzhen, three in company on their journey, suddenly heard behind them a voice crying out. The three turned their heads and beheld it was Hao Taigu. Presently, meeting one another, they exchanged words of parting sorrow. The four travelled together till they came to the region of Ku County, where they sought the place of the Supreme One’s descent. They saw nine wells encircling an eight-cornered pavilion, beside which stood a plum tree. Tradition holds that the Supreme One was born beneath this plum tree. The four entered the pavilion, where in the midst stood a stone stele recording the event of the descent. It was inscribed: In the time of Pan Geng, the Shang was changed to Yin; in the fifth year of Yin, there dwelt inhabitants here who excelled in the understanding of numbers and principles, able to perceive past and future affairs. Through pure stillness they cultivated themselves, living in lifelong seclusion, seeking no fame or recognition. Among the residents was a maiden, nineteen years old, unmarried; she was gentle and serene in disposition, disliking speech and laughter. One day, by chance, she came beneath the plum tree and saw a single plum on the branch, fresh and red and dear; she plucked and swallowed it, and thus became with child. Because the maiden was without a husband and yet conceived, rumours arose among the people; but the inhabitants, skilled in numbers, discerned that a great sage had descended to the world, and so they supported and upheld him, that the scholar might be unharmed. The sacred embryo was in the womb, and the time of birth was chosen.

Choosing a good year but no good month; choosing a good month but no good day; choosing a good day but no good time; thus did they choose and choose, for eighty-one years. At that time, the holy mother was over one hundred years old, carrying the sacred embryo, neither hungry nor cold, without sickness or calamity. On the fifteenth day of the second month, she went beneath the plum tree to disperse her melancholy. The Supreme One cleft the left side of the mother and leapt down; born with white hair, he could walk upon the earth immediately; he stepped forward seven paces, retreated three; and cried aloud three times, “Heaven above and earth beneath, I alone am revered.” When the cry was ended, in midair celestial music rang clear, fragrant breezes wafted, jade maidens scattered flowers, nine dragons spat water, and bathed him. The places where the water bathed became the nine wells. The Supreme One’s divine wisdom was unparalleled, his sacred virtue like Heaven’s. He took Li as his surname, because he was born with white hair; the people of that time called him Laozi. This is the origin of his birth. Other divine marvels are recorded in the classics and histories, with various evidences; not without foundation.

Having read the inscription, Liu, Hao and the others praised, saying: “The Supreme One’s way and customs left as a pattern, enduring through a thousand autumns, extolled through ten thousand ages, never ceasing to recall. We have all pursued the Way many years; the profound arts and mysterious subtleties, who knows which is inferior or superior? Before such immortal scenes, let us freely reveal the mysteries.”

Hao Taigu said:  
“The wise sword hangs high ‘midst cold stars,  
Legions of demons held powerless at birth;  
On cushions seated, the midnight moon breaks,  
Ninefold refined elixir, dragons and tigers entwined.”

Wang Yuyang said:  
“Viewing the immortal pavilion, recounting ancient warmth and cold,  
Examining and verifying the profound arts’ utmost point;  
Seizing the golden crow and jade hare,  
Naturally the tiger crouches and the dragon coils.”

Tan Changzhen said:  
“The method of the Way is boundless, spirits and ghosts shudder,  
Transcending the mundane and entering the sacred, whence the cause?  
With one fist shatter the net of folly,  
The crescent furnace holds dragons and tigers entwined.”

Liu Changsheng said:  
“Now men’s hearts and courage grow cold,  
Where the rainbow and wisteria float, the beginning arises;  
The wise become fools, fools wise men,  
What talk of the immortal mountain with dragons and tigers entwined?”

When the four had spoken, Wang Yuyang again asked: “What the three of us have said all accords with the wondrous Way! Words that speak of victory and not defeat; yet why does Brother Liu speak not of victory but of defeat, disparaging men’s rise? Surely this is not wondrous of the Way!” Tan Changzhen said: “Fearfulness is not the Way! Foolishness is not the mystery! Yet to make one’s courage cold, that cannot be said to be without the Way. To recognize folly, that cannot be said to be without the mystery. It is not to speak of the Way’s mystery, and yet the mystery is therein! Not to judge by victory or defeat, what cause is there to disparage success?”

Hao Taigu said: “Brother Liu’s words are not limited to this alone; there must be other reasons.” Tan Changzhen laughed, saying: “Indeed so, indeed so! Brother Liu went to the Jade Pool to attend a feast, secretly peeping at the immortal maidens; Queen Mother was angered and descended to the world. This was when the two of us met on the road. He spoke to me; I answered him by the test of charcoal and the purpose of Jingyang. When he heard my words, he resolved wholeheartedly to go.”

Tan Changzhen paused here and ceased speaking. Wang Yuyang asked: “What does he wholeheartedly intend to do?” Tan Changzhen said: “He means to enter the ranks of the rouge-clad troupe to comprehend the Way; to attend the silk and bamboo stage to investigate the mystery; to exert great effort in emptying colour and form.” Wang Yuyang said: “To look and see nothing, to listen and hear nothing, then indeed there is no colour or form.” Hao Taigu said: “Better to forget both self and other, and colour and form will be empty of themselves.” Liu Changsheng said: “Your words are for the superior and perfect men only; I now desire to use wide experience for subtle use, and broad knowledge for practice.” Wang Yuyang and Hao Taigu both said: “Those who refine the demon of colour, ancient and modern, are not few; we have never heard of such refining as this.” Tan Changzhen said: “The resolute may become clever; the irresolute may keep simplicity; each has wondrous use, no need to speak deeply.” They ceased speaking. Evening came; the four sat in meditation within the pavilion through the night. On the morrow, they parted ways.

It is told that Hao Taigu travelled to Huashang; lifting his head suddenly he saw a high mountain, shaped like a palm, towering into the clouds. When last he escorted the Master westward, the spirit coffin pressed upon his shoulder, he had no leisure to look about, and so had not seen this mountain. Now at leisure and carefree, on the road one cannot help but admire the mountain and river. At one glance his heart was greatly uplifted; recalling the Master’s words about the place seen, the site of realization of the Way, he ascended thereon, seeing myriad mountains bowing below. Formerly Kou Laigong composed a poem:  

Only Heaven above, no mountain to match.  
Raising the head, the red sun draws near;  
Lowering it, the clouds themselves bow.

Thus this mountain is the Western Peak, Mount Taihua, the Immortal Mountain. On the mountain are more than ten palaces and temples, each with Daoists burning incense, very numerous and bustling. Hao Taigu sought a quiet retreat. Skilled himself as a stone-worker, he set about making hammer and drill; by divine power he hewed a cave in the rock wall, large enough to hold a man sitting with knees bent. Just as he was about to enter the cave to rest, a Daoist friend arrived, carrying a mat on his back and a hand bell, asking Hao Taigu to yield the cave for his sitting. Hao Taigu had no time to reply; the man entered the cave of his own accord, spread his mat and sat down, regardless of consent, occupying the cave first. Hao Taigu, a man kind-hearted and gentle, could not refuse to let him have the cave, and so yielded it.

Going upwards, he saw by the roadside a great stone some several zhang high; he began to hew this stone, labouring with hands and feet, till he made a cave somewhat larger and wider than the former. He was greatly pleased. But again another Daoist came, saying he had no place to sit; “Why do you not kindly give me this cave?” Hao Taigu, a cultivator, fulfilled his wish and yielded the cave. In this way, more than ten men, having laboured with great hardship, made seventy-two caves; seventy-two men came and sought him to yield them all.

Hao Taigu still had no place to cultivate. He sought elsewhere, and found a place where a cave could be hewn, but it was amidst sheer cliffs several thousand feet high, where no swallow could fly. If a cave were made there, none of the Daoist friends however able to fly could reach it. Yet there was no path to approach; one must descend by rope or ascend by rope. Hao Taigu surveyed and descended, taking with him accumulated funds from alms to buy a long rope. On the way he took on a sincere disciple; the two journeyed to the mountain, tying the long rope to a great tree. Hao Taigu bore hammer and drill, holding the rope, stepping on the stone wall, and slowly lowering himself down to the place. There was a crevice where one could sit or stand; daily he busied himself in hewing a cave. The honest disciple prepared meals; Hao Taigu ate but one meal a day, returning only at night. The disciple grew impatient, thinking: “I thought learning the Way was leisure; who knew cooking would be such toil? What profit is there in learning the Way?” He became ill-disposed and secretly carried a firewood knife. Knowing that after eating Hao Taigu would go to hew the cave, he followed after, and as Hao Taigu lowered himself by the rope, the honest disciple drew his knife and cut the rope. The rope snapped taut and Hao Taigu fell down the thousand-foot precipice. Life or death was unknown.

Now there were some curious persons who wrote four lines on the stone wall of Hao’s cave. Do you guess what these four lines were?

Gentlemen, be careful, be careful,  
Descending nine li and three fen.  
Men fall from Huayin,  
Southward to seek the corpse.

Meanwhile, the honest disciple, having cut the rope and caused his master to fall down the precipice, thought surely he was dashed to pieces. He packed the bedding and luggage, and set out, going forward down the mountain for more than ten li. At a great stone he saw a man coming up the mountain, looking like his master. Looking closely, it was not he, and the disciple was greatly startled, sweat running down his back. He rushed forward and cried out, “Master, where are you going?” Hao Taigu smiled faintly and said, “Because this drill is dull, I go to the blacksmith of Shangzhou to have it re-sharpened. You carry your bedding and intend to go where?” The disciple answered, “I saw you had long not returned, so came to fetch you.” Hao Taigu laughed heartily, saying, “Truly a filial disciple! The master has been gone but an hour, and you so concerned, carrying your bedding to meet me. There remain eleven or twelve li of mountain path; the sun is but three zhang high; how could you arrive? Were it not that you brought bedding, tonight you might well endure the cold.”

Having said this, Hao Taigu went forward, leaving the disciple beneath the great stone, pondering within himself: “This master of mine, what manner of man is he? Such a high precipice he could not be killed by falling; his labours are not yet ended, yet he must still hew caves and cannot be free. To act so, could he be a god? Otherwise, how could he escape death by such a fall, and return so swiftly? Moreover, when he saw me, he only smiled, nor was he angry—he is a man of great magnanimity. I have lost this master; under Heaven I could find no second such compassionate man. Surely it is my fault; I will return to the mountain to serve him, hoping a way forward may appear.” So he followed after, and meeting his master said: “The rope is cut; how can you go hewing caves?” Hao Taigu said: “That matters not; I will leap down.” Saying this, he sprang and leapt down the thousand-foot precipice.

If you desire to know what befell thereafter, await the next chapter’s unfolding.

The body light and swift as flying clouds,  
What fear have I of precipices ten thousand feet high?
