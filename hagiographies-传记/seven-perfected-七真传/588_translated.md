# Chapter Twenty: Refining Form Amidst the Turmoil of Flowers and Smoke; Speaking of Subtle Words and Contemplating Pure Truth

To behold beauty without moving the heart—when the effort has reached this point, the depth comes of itself.

There was one who learned the method of True Emptiness; his tiger roar and dragon chant surpassed ancient and modern times.

It is said that Hao Taigu was a man who had attained the Way; how then could he be cast down? When his disciple severed the long cord, he had already cast off the mortal frame. Now he only manifests the Way, so that later generations may know that the spirits and immortals may indeed be learned. That disciple, seeing his master leap from the rocky cliff, was filled with terror in his heart. After waiting several days without seeing him return, they each departed.

It is said that Liu Changsheng wholeheartedly wished to refine the demon of lustful form. Hearing that the provinces of Su and Hang abounded in beauties, he proceeded thither. Collecting some rough stones, he transformed them into gold and silver; discarding his Taoist robes, he purchased several pieces of silk and satin apparel. Dressed thus, he swaggered boldly into a brothel, where the madam followed him and could not but inquire.

Liu Changsheng said to her, "I am called Changshengzi, a man of Yanshan. I have come here bearing pearls and jewels, having journeyed long abroad, seeking the finest sister to ease my mind."

The madam, hearing he was a merchant of jewels, knew him to be a god of wealth come, and, dropping her smiling face, she doubled her flattery, leading him to the chamber of a peerless beauty. This courtesan was named Siyu; she was famous among the flower-and-smoke houses, skilled in singing, dancing, and music, adept at writing and painting, and could recite a few lines of poetry; graceful and lovely. Siyu, seeing Changshengzi, noted his elegant bearing and gentle speech, and his frank and open manner, without the slightest trace of haughtiness. Such a good guest—how could she not receive him? She accordingly displayed all her gentleness and a hundred charms, dancing coquettishly to win his favour.

Changshengzi, following the two sayings of Master Chongyang: "Before the collapse of Mount Tai, one is not alarmed; not through mere cause, but because before the collapse it is as though it had not collapsed; before the beauty, the heart is unmoved; not through cause, but as if the beauty were not before one"—Changshengzi framed his heart empty, utterly devoid: no demon of obstruction could approach. In vain did the sister exhibit a thousand attitudes, a myriad of allurements; she could not move his heart.

This heart is the lord of the body; when the heart does not move, the body is at peace. Other thoughts obey the heart’s arrangement; if the heart does not move, they dare not move either. Only the eyes and ears are two busybodies. Seeing good form and hearing sweet sounds, they report to the heart. Changshengzi praised the heart and bade it not to trust the eyes and ears, lest the great matter be spoiled. The heart, heeding his words, put on the guise of ignorance and unknowing, like a child who only knows play and does not understand matters of passion. Lying on the same bed, sharing the same pillow, it was but a foul skin bag accompanying a rosy skeleton; no great interest, only red and green to the eyes, and clanging sounds to the ears.

Changshengzi also flattered the eyes and ears, teaching them a method: to see as if not seeing, to hear as if not hearing. The two faithfully followed his method, feigning blindness and deafness; though rising and falling with the sister, they still did not recognize what sort of person he was, nor his precious worth.

It is said that through flattering these three elders—Heart Master, Eyes, and Ears—Liu Changsheng was preserved within the flower-and-smoke house and attained the rank of true immortal. Now no longer bound by form or appearance, he often played within those courtesans’ chambers. The courtesans, seeing him willing to spend silver, and observing Changshengzi walking side by side with Sister Yu, casually placed a fresh flower upon his head, and attempted to strip away his male garments to dress him in female attire. They undid the buttons upon his breast, when suddenly a cough was heard outside. A black-faced, short-bearded barbarian monk came crashing in—his eyes large, eyebrows thick, forehead arched, nose high, his visage strange and fearsome. Several courtesans shrank behind Changshengzi, not daring to utter a word.

Who was this barbarian monk? It was none other than Patriarch Bodhidharma of the Western Land, journeying through the South Sea and passing by Hangzhou; seeing purple mist rising into the air from the house, he thought a true immortal had descended. Yet why such a one should be wandering amidst the flower-and-smoke, he desired to come to instruct and convert him.

Entering the house, he found the courtesans and Changshengzi wearing flowers and undressing, making a merry tumult. The madam kept her head bowed, tidying the chests and cupboards; the other courtesans were dozing in their chambers. Hearing the laughter behind, Bodhidharma burst in.

Changshengzi, catching sight of him at once, knew him to be a man of distinction, hastened to rise respectfully, inviting him to sit. Seeing a copper kettle on the table, with cold water that would not brew tea, and no time to heat it, he took the kettle and placed it upon his belly, practicing the fire arts. Suddenly a rumbling arose within the kettle; steam burst from the spout, showing the water was boiling. He then took a pinch of finest Maojian tea leaves, placed them in a bowl, poured on the boiling water, and, holding it with both hands, offered it respectfully to Bodhidharma.

The courtesans, seeing this marvel, stared in bewilderment, all calling it strange and uncanny.

Changshengzi smiled and said, "This is but a spark of true fire from the five elements; what is there to be astonished at? I can also bake pancakes and griddle cakes upon my belly." The courtesans, hearing this, did not believe him; some fetched flour, others water. Soon a pancake the size of a bowl was prepared and brought to Changshengzi to bake. He took it in hand, placed it on his belly, turning thrice to the left and thrice to the right; the cake took on a cooked hue. Turning it over, he turned it a few more times until it was done, then handed it to the courtesans, who tore pieces off and ate it. 

Bodhidharma was one who saw the emptiness of the world, who placed no matters in his heart, who never contended with others in his life, and who possessed a broad and deep compassion. If he were one of shallow capacity, would he not also show off some Taoist skill? He remained perfectly unmoved, and feigned a certain foolishness, saying: "Your method is indeed amusing; I will come again to learn from you." Saying this, he cupped his hands and departed.

Before leaving, he uttered four sentences: "Having known the way from the east, do not err in returning west; do not obscure your true nature, lingering long, not returning home."

Liu Changsheng, hearing this, replied with four sentences: "Empty, empty, without a thing, how can thoughts err? Who commands this body? Where is my home?"

Hearing these, Bodhidharma knew he was a man of cultivation and no longer spoke, drifting away like a cloud.

It is said that Yuyang came from the south, and at Kushan he discoursed on the Way with Changsheng, intending to go to Su and Hang to refine demons. Having parted for over a year, he feared Changshengzi might lose his true nature amidst the flower-and-smoke, and so came to visit him, hoping to persuade him to return early to the mountains and forests. On that day, arriving at Hangzhou, he sought through several brothels but could not find him. Passing by one place, he saw two painted courtesans standing by the door. Approaching, he sought to ask after Changshengzi.

The two courtesans, seeing him come, smiled and asked, "Are you the Taoist who has come to meet the guest who bakes griddle cakes upon his belly?"

Yuyang, noting their words were strange and suspecting Changsheng was inside, replied casually that he was come to meet him. One of the courtesans said, "If you would see him, follow me." Saying which, she went inside, with Yuyang following.

How did the two courtesans know his intent? Yesterday they had seen the barbarian monk, dressed in a large collar and holding a spade; today they saw Yuyang similarly dressed and armed, and suspected he had come to play another trick on their guest. They therefore led him in, and when near the gatekeeper’s room, suddenly the madam called out; the two courtesans abandoned Yuyang and left him there.

Yuyang saw the chamber door half-open and pushed it aside. There he beheld Changshengzi, accompanied by a peerless courtesan, dozing beside the bed. Unable to restrain a smile, Yuyang took a fire coal cylinder from the table, gently lit it, and blew the sparks toward Changshengzi’s face. The coal flew wildly, falling upon the sister’s tender skin, burning her. She awoke with a start, waving her sleeve madly, exclaiming, "Who is here playing with fire to burn me?"

Changshengzi laughed and said, "The demon is playing with me."

Yuyang also laughed, saying, "I too play with the demon."

Changshengzi readily answered, "If you call me demon, I am demon; one demon can escape weariness. Now you play with fire to burn a woman’s face; between us, which is the greater demon?"

Yuyang was about to converse further when Liu Changsheng said, "Go quickly; there are men waiting for you in Chu, you may together ascend the Way’s shore."

Yuyang asked, "When do you depart?"

Changshengzi replied, "When I go, I go; no fixed date is needed."

Hearing this, Yuyang bowed slightly and left the flower-and-smoke house, proceeding toward Chu. On the way, he passed Tan Changzhen, who said that running hither and thither was of no use, and that quiet cultivation was beneficial. The two entered Yunmeng, cultivated for several years, and attained true accomplishment. Tan Changzhen wrote the "Collection of Clouds and Waters," Yuyang wrote the "Collection of Cloud Light." Tan Changzhen ascended on the first day of the fourth month; Yuyang ascended on the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month.

It is further said that Changshengzi, having refined and emptied the forms of lust in Su and Hang, departed thence and returned to Eastern Lu, entering the mountains to cultivate in quiet. In the third year of Jiatai, the year Guihai, on the eighth day of the second month, he ascended. He authored the "Collection of True Cultivation."

Again, Hao Taigu, having cultivated for many years on Mount Taihua, ascended on the thirtieth day of the eleventh month of the year Chouchou, and authored the "Collection of Taigu."

Among the Seven Perfected, four have completed their course; only Qiu Changchun, Ma Danyang, and Sun Buer have not yet finished their affairs. Let us speak now of Sun Buer. She cultivated diligently in Luoyang for twelve years; having attained the Great Way and its boundless transformations, she knew that Ma Danyang was guarding at home and would find it hard to complete the Way. She wished to return home to instruct him, but also thought, "I have been many years in Luoyang; all call me madwoman. If I do not manifest the Way, how can I transform and save men’s hearts?" So she went out beyond the kiln, broke off two branches, blew two breaths of true qi, and, calling out, the two branches changed into a man and a woman, tugging and pulling each other, and went into Luoyang city. The people saw the madwoman holding an unknown man in the street, running up and down, embracing and holding at waist and shoulder, cursing and unable to drive them away, striking and unable to repel them; how could they not be angered? Moreover, Luoyang is a great city of propriety and righteousness; how could they allow her to behave so wildly? All conferred and resolved to apprehend the two. Whether they could or could not, we shall see in the next chapter.

Since ancient times, streets and lanes should be quiet and elegant; how could they permit men and women to run about disorderly?
