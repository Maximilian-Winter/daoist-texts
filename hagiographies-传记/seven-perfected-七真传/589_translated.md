# Chapter Twenty-One: Sun Bu'er Displays the Way in Luoyang — Ma Danyang Meets a Friend in the West of the Pass

Let not the six thieves daily assail one another;  
All forms and hues are but emptiness.  

Having realized that originally there is not a single thing,  
The spirit's platform abides only in this heart.  

It is related that Sun Bu’er transformed tree branches into a man and a woman, resembling human form. Every day they embraced and clung to one another in the street; neither beating nor scolding could drive them away. The neighbours were at their wits’ end, and together drew up a memorial: ‘The people and shops of the whole city submit this petition, to rectify customs and discipline the community. Some years ago, a mad woman came from afar, lodging in a broken kiln outside the city. We, pitying her hardships, could not bear to expel her, and frequently gave her food and drink to sustain her life. Now this mad woman is seen daily with a man, embracing and laughing together. We have repeatedly driven them away but to no avail. This is truly an intolerable matter. Luoyang is a great capital, a strategic thoroughfare of north and south. How can it bear such disgrace, to bring laughter to outsiders? We earnestly beseech the honest and clear-minded authorities to take action and destroy this demon man and demon woman.’  

The magistrate of Luoyang County, upon receiving this memorial, pondered awhile, then took up his brush and decreed: ‘A so-called madman is one who has lost his true nature. If one is deemed ignorant of human affairs, then all things are excused. But according to this petition, their nature is not lost, but they feign madness. That a man and woman wander together violates propriety; their embracing and clinging grievously injure the public morals. They dare do this in broad daylight; what may be imagined of their conduct by night need not be said. The neighbourhood is no place for revelry; a broken kiln is no place for licentiousness. Since they cannot be driven away, their forms must be destroyed. Let them be awaited in their nest, and spare not a single cartload of firewood; set the kiln ablaze and burn them up, that their kind may be utterly cut off.’  

When the decree was finished, the officers issued it forth. The neighbours, having received this judgment, each took a bundle of wood and came to the broken tile kiln. As they were on the way, they saw the mad man and woman holding hands and entering the kiln. The people shouted aloud and cast the firewood into the kiln. In a moment, the kiln was piled into a mountain of fuel, and the flames rose high, sparks flying in disorder. Suddenly thick smoke burst forth from the kiln’s hole, transforming into five-coloured auspicious clouds. Within the clouds sat three immortals. Among them, seated in the centre, was the very mad woman who had caused such disturbance in the street. She spoke to the gathered neighbours from amidst the clouds: ‘I am a cultivator, residing in Shandong, surnamed Sun, named Bu’er. I have concealed myself in madness and folly here to cultivate for twelve years. Now that great accomplishment is complete, I intend to ascend by fire. Therefore I transformed tree branches into a man and a woman, to lead you all hither. I now entrust this man and woman to you as evidence.’ Having said this, she pushed the two beside her from the clouds and they rolled down. The people hastened to catch them, and found them to be mere forked branches. They all laughed heartily. Looking again, the mad woman had already entered the Milky Way, her form gradually dwindling, until in a flash she was but a black shadow like a wild goose soaring straight upward, growing smaller as a coin or bean, and then vanished. The people worshipped the sky, and for several years thereafter the weather was favourable and the people prosperous. They all praised her great virtue and built a Temple of the Three Immortals; prayers offered there were always answered.  

Again it is told that Sun Bu’er returned to Ninghai County in Shandong. On arriving at the village, Ma Xing immediately espied him and hastened to welcome him. Sun Bu’er proceeded directly into the hall and settled down. Ma Xing went to report this to the yamen official, and Ma Danyang came forth to meet him, saying: ‘Dao friend Sun, you have laboured greatly.’ Sun Bu’er replied: ‘Brother, what need to speak of labour? The word “labour” is the test of us cultivators. Without endurance of hardship, how can cultivation be attained?’ While speaking thus, many servants came to pay respects; Bu’er kindly reassured them. That night he sat in meditation side by side with Ma Danyang. During the night, Ma Danyang rose several times, but Sun Bu’er remained unmoved. Ma Danyang said: ‘I see your sitting practice excels mine.’ Sun Bu’er said: ‘Not only is my sitting practice somewhat better than yours, but the mystery I possess surpasses yours tenfold.’ Ma Danyang said: ‘Do not slight me; I can turn stones into silver.’ Sun Bu’er said: ‘You can turn stones into silver, I can turn stones into gold; but gold and silver cannot transcend birth and death, nor produce immortals. They are ultimately useless. Once Master Lü of Pure Yang followed Master Zhongli in learning the Way. The master wrapped a heavy object in brocade, weighing some tens of catties, and made Lü carry it. For three years Lü bore it, his shoulders worn through, but without complaint. At length the master bade him unwrap it, and behold, it was a stone. Lü made no lament. The master said, “Though it is a hard stone, it can be turned into gold. Your three years’ bearing have not been in vain.” Saying this, he touched the stone, which changed into gold. He said to Lü, “Shall I teach you the method of turning stone into gold?” Lü asked, “Will the gold thus made endure without change?” Zhongli replied, “The gold thus made is unlike true gold; it remains gold for five hundred years, but after that will turn back into stone.” Lü then declined the teaching, saying, “If so, I do not wish to learn. This art benefits for five hundred years, but harms for five hundred years later. Is it not a misfortune to those after five hundred years? Therefore I will not learn.” Zhongli sighed, “Your understanding of the Way surpasses mine; your attainment must be greater than mine.” By this it is seen that the art of turning stone into gold harms future generations and profits not the Way.’ These words left Ma Danyang silent.  

On another day, Sun Bu’er boiled a pot of water, carried it into the room in a bucket, and poured it into a bath-box, inviting Ma Danyang to bathe. It was the eighth month, when the heavenly way was still hot. The steam rising was so dense that it was impossible to discern it clearly. Ma Danyang reached out his hand and nearly scalded himself, exclaiming again and again, ‘Hard to bathe! Hard to bathe!’ Sun Bu’er smiled, ‘After many years of cultivation, do you still lack even this small skill? Let me bathe first.’ Saying this, he undressed and bathed, sprinkling water about without complaint of heat.  

When the bath was done and he sat down clad again, Ma Danyang said: ‘We have the same master and learn the same Way, using the same methods, yet your skill surpasses mine somewhat.’ Sun Bu’er said: ‘Though the teaching is the same, the refining is different. I toiled bitterly in Luoyang for twelve years to attain these mysteries. You have enjoyed ease at home, guarding a few rooms without moving an inch, unwilling to endure hardship or leave your nest. How could you gain such marvels?’ Ma Danyang said: ‘Since our master’s ascension and transformation, there has been no one to guard the estate, so I have not ventured far. Now that my Dao friend has returned, I may entrust affairs and also go abroad to seek the Way.’ That night he changed into Daoist garments, and at dawn, while all still slept, he silently left the village unnoticed.  

Seeing Danyang depart, Sun Bu’er thought: ‘If he is to become a true adept, what need has he for all this wealth? Better to use it to repair bridges and roads, and to aid the poor.’ He adopted Ma Ming’s son and took up the Ma Yu clan branch; all affairs settled, he retreated to Jade Maiden Peak of Mount Tai, cultivated for several years, and on the nineteenth day of the second month ascended.  

Again it is told that Ma Danyang left Ninghai County, uncertain whither to go. Suddenly he thought of his master’s tomb in Shaanxi, and resolved to journey thither westward. One day, arriving at Chang’an, he espied from afar a Dao friend emerging from a village, resembling Qiu Changchun. He thought within himself, ‘Whether it be he or not, I shall venture to call out.’ So he shouted, ‘Dao friend Qiu!’ The man heard and ran to meet him like the wind, and indeed it was Qiu Changchun. They met and exchanged salutations, then sat by the roadside. Ma Danyang asked where he had travelled these past years, and how his cultivation had progressed. Qiu Changchun answered, ‘My master’s tomb is here; I cannot bear to leave it far behind, so I have not dared to neglect my inner work of cultivation.’ Ma Danyang laughed and said, ‘Our master has attained the Great Way; how can he die? Death is but the severing of the vain hopes of descendants to become immortals. Is it truly death? Inner cultivation is the work within; virtue and conduct are the works without. You say you have not neglected cultivation — is this not mistaken?’ Qiu Changchun heard this and was suddenly enlightened. He hurriedly thanked Danyang, saying, ‘Your words have opened my eyes after a lifetime of darkness. I, Qiu, am indeed fortunate.’ When he was to take leave of the spirit pivot, he saw the master’s face and repeated what he had said to Ma Danyang. Danyang said, ‘The master often said you cannot conceal your light and humble yourself; you always seek to display cleverness. Your attainment will come only after six others. You must henceforth be cautious. If you can reflect on yourself, hide your cunning, and cultivate simplicity, I will impart to you the Way the master taught me.’ Changchun rejoiced exceedingly, and led him to the village of Dawei to pay respects at the master’s temple. They then went to the foot of Zhongnan Mountain, visited the tomb, and afterwards wandered together through Jing and Xiang.  

Qiu Changchun deeply repented, concealed himself, and ceased his display of cleverness. Ma Danyang indeed imparted to him the subtle secrets of the Way. Changchun diligently studied the profound truths without slackening. Seeing that the scenery of Chu was splendid but not so simple as Shaanxi, they journeyed from the Xiang River to the Xu valley. One day heavy snow fell, and the two were trapped in the cold temple of the valley. They shared a single rush mat in meditation — why did the two share one mat? Because when Qiu Changchun came to Ma family village to learn the Way, there were no Daoist utensils. Later, accompanying Master Chongyang to the south of the Yangtze, Ma Danyang gave him his own patched robe, rush mat, and portable bell. On delivering the master’s spirit pivot, the rush mat was wrapped in the patched robe and carried in the coffin to Shaanxi. Over the years the patched robe was worn threadbare, but the rush mat remained intact. Ma Danyang sat at home in meditation on felt bedding, so he did not remanufacture a rush mat. In haste at departure he took only a few changes of clothes and some small silver coins. When he met Qiu Changchun, his silver was gone, and he relied entirely on Changchun’s support. One person’s resources served two, and there was no money left to obtain a rush mat. Hence the two shared one mat, sitting back to back. Cultivators do not seek ease, only what suffices.  

It is said that Ma Danyang and Qiu Changchun sat meditating in the cold temple in the Xu valley. That night a heavy snow fell, three feet deep on the plain. The Xu valley lies among myriad mountains, far from any dwelling, with no food to be found. For three days and nights they suffered hunger. Qiu Changchun suddenly had a thought — but what thought was it? See the next chapter for the explanation.  

Hungry and cold, suffering hardships unspeakable,  
How can it but breed vain thoughts in men?
