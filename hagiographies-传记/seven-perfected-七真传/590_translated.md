# Chapter Twenty-Two: Dividing the Mat, The Great Way Detached from Affection; Inquiring into Physiognomy, Appraising Men Face to Face

To do good is like climbing a hundred-foot pole; it is easy to descend, but hard to ascend.

Only by diligent effort in practising the fruit of merit, avoid letting the courage and spirit within the body grow cold.

It is said that Ma Danyang and Qiu Changchun were sitting in meditation at the Cold Temple in the Slanting Valley, snow barring their passage so that they could not go out to seek alms. Qiu Changchun did not know that Ma Danyang was a man who had attained the Way, but only pitied him as a man of wealthy family, wondering how he could endure such cold and hunger. Thinking to find some household and beg a bowl of gruel to supply him, he went out of the temple and looked about. He saw the clouds stretching across the Qin Mountains, the snow covering a thousand hills. Not to speak of finding any household, even the traces of a path were pressed down by the snow. He knew not where to set his feet; to force his way on would surely cause him to fall into a snow pit, so that not only would the gruel be unattainable, but life itself might be imperilled. Having looked and seen this, he returned into the temple and sat down again. Yet pitying Ma Danyang’s hunger, this thought of gruel disturbed his spirit and breath, and his mind was troubled and restless, his sitting uneasy. Through the night this thought plagued him repeatedly without ceasing; alarmed, he hastened to the house of Elder Zhang in the mountain hollow to send a dream. Zhang Elder was in the midst of sleep, his soul bewildered, when suddenly he saw a white-haired old man enter the room, saying: ‘In my temple are two practitioners, hindered by snow, hungry for three days and three nights. Rise quickly and cook some food to send to them, that they may have relief from hunger and thirst.’ Having said this, he vanished. Zhang Elder awoke with a start, and called his wife to explain the matter. His wife, who was ever most trusting in spirits, heard this and quickly kindled the fire, calling their son and daughter-in-law to rise with them. They all prepared food, and Elder Zhang told them of his dream. The son and daughter-in-law rejoiced, and soon had the meal ready. At dawn Elder Zhang rose and bade his son take the food to the Cold Temple, inviting the two to eat. Ma Danyang thought it was a neighbour, seeing their hunger, who had secretly taken pity and brought this food to relieve their hunger and thirst. So, together with Changchun, he ate the meal. After expressing thanks, they resumed their meditation. Zhang Elder’s son, having seen them finish, took away the bowls and chopsticks and departed.

Ma Danyang sat until afternoon, then rose to look at the sky. Seeing a man approaching from afar, fearing entanglement, he hurried back into the temple to sit down. Just then Qiu Changchun rose and said: ‘It seems that practitioners have spiritual response. Last night, fearing that my senior brother could not endure hunger, I suddenly had the thought to find some gruel to relieve his thirst and hunger. At once this thought arose, and this morning someone brought the meal. Is this not a sign of spiritual response?’ Ma Danyang’s countenance changed and he angrily said: ‘A man of virtue seeks the Way, not food. You think not to advance in the work of the Way, but only to crave food and drink. Have you not heard that the past mind must not be preserved, the present mind must not be entertained, and the future mind must not arise? Your three minds are not yet settled; your one thought is impure. How can you comprehend the Way? I will no longer walk with you. Let us part here.’ Changchun, hearing this, repented his thought and tried to reason gently to detain him. While they were speaking, a man came from outside the temple. This man, having used up the firewood at home, came to cut some branches from the trees before the temple. Ma Danyang saw he held a vegetable knife, and borrowed it. The man, not knowing the purpose, passed the knife to him. Ma Danyang took the knife and took the meditation mat, cutting it into two parts. Returning the knife, he said to Changchun: ‘One mat divided into two sections; you take one half, I take the other. Each should carry out their cultivation. Do not begin with diligence and end in sloth, thus ruining your future.’ Saying this, he went out.

Qiu Changchun would not give up, and followed quickly. The man who cut the wood saw him and said: ‘At such a time, Master, whither go you?’ Changchun, seeing the question, hastened to reply: ‘I go to overtake my senior brother.’ The man looked about, seeing no one, and said: ‘Where has your senior brother gone? I see no one.’ Changchun pointed to the middle path and said: ‘He went that way.’ The man said: ‘This path is tens of li without a soul; the day is late, and where would he lodge? I advise you pass the night here, and to seek him tomorrow.’ Changchun said: ‘If you would help me shout a few times, perchance he may hear and return.’ The man climbed the tree and shouted: ‘Daoist, come back quickly! You cannot go! You cannot go!’ He shouted more than ten times, but no response came. Coming down, he gathered his firewood and went home. It was that Ma Danyang had now attained the fruit of the Way; thus they parted, that Changchun might cultivate himself and use his efforts. If they were to go together, it would only hinder his progress.

That day Ma Danyang left the temple and travelled via Tu Tong all the way to Song Mountain in Henan to rest quietly. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month in the jiazi year of Jiatai, he flew up to heaven. He left behind the ‘Records of Cultivating the True.’ Among the Seven Perfected, six completed their work; only Qiu Changchun had yet to attain success. Since parting with Ma Danyang, he redoubled his efforts, setting several vows and composing a poem to eliminate delusions:

When delusions arise, resist not; hunger longs for food, thirst for broth;
Now all delusions are ended, changing the old broth of the past;
If one desires man’s wealth, sinews and bones will break; greed for man’s food will cause sores in the mouth;
All manner of delusions are extinguished; within the body is emptiness, nothing stored.

Pleased beyond measure with the poem’s completion, after a month he found himself forgetting some things. So he went to a carpenter’s shop and obtained a plank, making a small tablet. Borrowing brush and ink, he wrote eight lines on the tablet to serve as a warning to the eye. The eight lines were:

Delusions to be removed cannot be cleared; now on the tablet they are plainly written;
False words and false speech are all removed; false thoughts and greed all swept away;
False grasping of money breaks the hand; greed for food causes mouth sores;
Examine carefully the matters about you, and let not the seven emotions nor six desires arise.

Qiu Changchun kept the tablet with him, reading it once or twice daily. As delusion lessened, his work deepened. Gradually refining his practice, he wandered east and west. One day in Hedong he saw a neat village by the roadside, the gate wide open. It was midday, so he went to beg alms. A young servant came out, and Changchun said: ‘I have come from afar specially to this virtuous village to beg a meal.’ The servant heard and entered, returning soon with a thousand bowls and a plate of food placed on a stone block before the village, then invited Changchun to eat. Just as Changchun was about to eat, an old man of about fifty, with half-white beard and hair, came out, glanced at Changchun, took two steamed buns from the plate and gave them to him, while bidding the servant take the rest inside. Changchun, displeased, said to the old man: ‘This young man brought the food out to make connection with this poor Daoist. Why then did you bid him take it away? Perhaps the old gentleman is unwilling, or the poor Daoist is unworthy to enjoy it. Please explain frankly and without reserve.’

The old man smiled and said: ‘A meal’s connection is not lightly made; but the Daoist has no blessing to enjoy it.’ Changchun was greatly surprised and said: ‘I cannot even enjoy a single meal; there must be a reason. I hope the old gentleman will teach me clearly.’ The old man said: ‘From childhood I have studied the physiognomy of the Ma Yi School, wandering the world many years, discerning men’s poverty and wealth, longevity and death, honour and disgrace without error. The world calls me Sai Ma Yi. Just now I looked upon your physiognomy and saw that you cannot eat your fill. If you eat one full meal, you must go hungry for several. It is better to give you less, that you may have food at every meal. This is my good intention, not unwillingness.’ Changchun nodded and said: ‘Old gentleman truly speaks my failing, not a hair’s breadth amiss. Pray examine me again, and see if my cultivation has attained the Way.’ Sai Ma Yi accordingly examined him again and said: ‘No, no. Excuse my frankness. I see two wrinkles on the tip of your nose, each dividing into two at the nostrils, called the Téng Snake locking the mouth. This portends death by hunger. Elsewhere you are fair, but this calamity you cannot escape. Since this calamity cannot be avoided, how can you attain the Way?’ Changchun said: ‘Is there any remedy?’ Sai Ma Yi said: ‘Physiognomy is fixed for life; what change can there be? Only death can end it. Whether rich or poor, whether in the world or withdrawn, if one’s fate is to die of hunger, he will die of hunger, and no escape or law can avert it.

I will tell you of two ancient men. In the time of the Warring States there was King Zhao Wuling, who bore this same physiognomy, doomed to die of hunger. But he was a ruler of a kingdom; how could he die of hunger? Because his two sons contended for the throne, raising arms, and fearing he might waver in affection, he first sealed the palace gates and stationed soldiers there. A prolonged fight ensued for months without resolution; the palace ran out of food, and all officials perished of hunger. King Zhao Wuling went seven days without tea or water, and seeing a bird’s nest in a tree before the palace, wished to catch a young bird to eat. A long ladder stood beside, which he placed against the tree and climbed with difficulty. But the young birds had flown, and only one egg was in his hand, just as he was about to eat it, a large bird flew by and flapped its wings. Startled, King Zhao Wuling loosened his grip, and the egg fell and broke on the ground. Because his fate was death by hunger, he could not eat even a single egg, and so he died of hunger. Again, in the time of Emperor Cheng of Han, there was an official named Deng Tong. A physiognomist told him he was doomed to die of hunger. One day he reported to Emperor Cheng, saying: “I, Deng Tong, am an honest official with no surplus at home. The physiognomist says I shall die of hunger. I fear that this will come to pass.” Emperor Cheng said: “I can make men rich and poor, can give life and death. What trust is to be put in a physiognomist’s words? I will grant you the right to cast money at Tong Mountain in Yunnan for one year; in ten years you shall possess a fortune of millions. How can you die of hunger?” Deng Tong thought himself safe from hunger. But soon Emperor Cheng died, and the Crown Prince ascended. The civil and military officials accused him of flattering the old emperor, seeking to fatten himself, secretly minting money at the state copper mountain. His crime was great. The young emperor, reading this report, was displeased and ordered the Ministry of Punishment to confiscate his property. Out of pity for the late emperor’s old servant, he spared his life but imprisoned him. Many officials accused him further, cutting off water and fire; he starved for seven or eight days. On the verge of death, he asked for water to wet his mouth. A jailer, moved by pity, brought water, but a prison officer saw it and shouted. The jailer was frightened, stumbled, and spilled a bowl of cold water on the ground. Thus he starved to death, not having drunk a single mouthful.

These two ancient men, in the height of wealth and power, both died of hunger; is this not proof of the truth of physiognomy? Therefore Bo Yi and Shu Qi knew their fate and chose to die beneath Mount Shouyang; Emperor Wu of Liang and King Fu Jian of Later Qin knew not their fate, and starved to death at Taicheng and Mount Wujiang. Knowing fate or not, if one is doomed to die of hunger, one must die of hunger; who can escape it?’ These ancient men overwhelmed Qiu Changchun, turning his fervent thought into cold ashes. The heart of enlightenment was dissolved and scattered. He took leave of Sai Ma Yi and did not press forward, returning to Western Qin, resolved to emulate the two worthy men Bo Yi and Shu Qi, to know fate and obey Heaven. Once he came to a mountain valley, a ravine with high hills on both sides and a deep stream between, the banks strewn with rocks. It was a secluded mountain path, rarely travelled. He chose a large stone and lay upon it, starving for seven days and seven nights without drinking a mouthful of water. He died peacefully of hunger. Because he was a practitioner, his spirit was full and he could not easily die of hunger; a common man would have long since passed away. On the ninth day, a sudden rain fell somewhere, causing the river to rise rapidly and flood his side. He was a man resigned to death, willing to accept fate and obey Heaven to test physiognomy, and would not seek another path but to die there; hence the delay. Had he not accepted his fate, but changed his mind and jumped into the water, would he not have spared much suffering? The ancient men’s hearts were single and undivided, not swayed by life or death; hence they were called good and simple.

Meanwhile, a fresh peach, as large as a clenched fist, was carried by the upstream current, floating before Changchun, its fragrance entering the nostrils. Changchun had no intention of eating it, thinking: ‘King Wuling died unable to eat a single egg; Deng Tong died unable to drink a bowl of cold water. Now, at the moment of my death, I do not know whether I may eat this fresh peach or not.’ Whether Changchun ate it or not will be revealed in the next chapter.

Fate not to die yet may be saved; Heaven sends a fresh peach to his lips.
