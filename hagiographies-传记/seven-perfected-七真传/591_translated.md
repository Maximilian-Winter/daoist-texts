# Chapter Twenty-Three: Transforming the Obstinate and Returning from Error; Discussing the Ultimate Truth, Finding Life through Death

Wealth and honour are like the foam upon the water—why need one mount a crane to ascend to Yangzhou?

At Lotus Pond there is a method to collect the heart; in stillness one softly chants the seven pen strokes.

It is said that Qiu Changchun saw a fresh peach floating upon the water; thinking his fate was to die of hunger, fearing that this cluster of peaches might not be sufficient food, he resolved to try it and see how it might be. Thought thus, he stretched out his hand and took the fresh peach to eat; its fragrance and sweetness were extraordinary. When he had eaten, his spirit revived greatly, hunger and thirst at once ceased, the stream also dried up, and the red sun shone high, drying his whole body in sweat. Unable to sleep peacefully, he turned over and reflected that his fate was not to perish by the water's edge, but surely to perish on a high mountain. This was indeed a single thought entangled in delusion, a lifelong adherence to error. Therefore those who cultivate the Way must take the words “life” and “death” seriously, not to be wholly greedy of life, nor to seek death altogether. Let life be as it may, and death be as it may; do not cling to existence, nor drown in non-existence. Thus the demon cannot enter the person’s body, and the heart itself attains tranquillity.

Again it is said that Qiu Changchun came to the Qin Mountains, and saw a small temple upon the ridge—a lonely and remote place, seldom trodden by men. He entered the temple, spread out his mat, and lay down upon it. He had now gone hungry for eight or nine days, without drinking water. One day, seeing life hanging by a thread, he suddenly heard voices outside. Changchun slightly opened his hungry eyes and looked out, seeing more than ten men sitting before the temple. Then one came into the temple, glanced at him, and asked whence he came. Changchun’s heart was impatient and he would not answer the inquiry about his origin, his eyes but faint lines of spirit. Seeing that he seemed near death, the man asked no more, and went outside. They all went to gather firewood, and with three stones set up a pot. From a basket they took out a large piece of meat, threw it into the pot to cook, and then offered it to the gods.

After the offering, they cut the meat into small pieces, fried it with seasoning, and poured it into an earthenware basin. They also brought a pot of water below it, and took from the basket a bottle of wine, which they poured into bowls. ‘Brothers and friends,’ they said, and began to eat and drink heartily. You ask who these people were? They were bandits who waylaid travellers in the Qin Mountains. Among their notable men were Zhao Bi, Li Xiong, Zhang Jian, Wang Neng, and Zhu Jiu. Having made a good bargain, they came both to offer to the gods and to divide their plunder, providing food and drink, and gathered in a circle to feast. When the wine was half drunk, Wang Neng said to Zhao Bi, ‘Brother Zhao, we have been bad men all our lives; shall we now do some good?’ Zhao Bi replied, ‘What good can there be? Tell us, brother, and make all arrangements complete.’ Wang Neng said, ‘The old master lying faint in the temple is not ill, I think, but starved. Why do we not cook some noodle soup for him to eat, and save his life?’ Brother Zhao agreed, and bade the men to make haste. Hearing their orders, they bustled about, and soon the noodle soup was ready. They entered the temple and called Changchun to eat. He refused, but they helped him up, held his head, and forced two bowls down his throat. Suddenly his stomach was full and warm, his spirit revived, but he complained, ‘See now that my great matter is settled, and I meet you people, who make me eat nameless food, so that I must endure more suffering. Truly to seek life is impossible, and to seek death requires much effort.’ As Changchun spoke thus, he angered Zhu Jiu’s temper, who drew a steel knife from his waist and angrily pointed it at him, scolding, ‘You wild fellow, so ignorant! We brothers save you alive, and you call our food nameless? Now you seek death, and we shall grant you a quick death.’ Saying so, he lifted his knife to strike. But Qiu Changchun was not afraid; he patted his belly and said, ‘If you wish to kill me, need not kill elsewhere; only cut open my belly, and when I pull out my entrails I will return your nameless food, and die willingly.’ Having spoken thus, Zhu Jiu could not help but laugh, and said, ‘You old master have no sense; how can one take back food once eaten? I will not kill you, but tell me, why do you seek death? Speak before us all.’ 

Qiu Changchun then told how the fortune-teller Ma Yi predicted that he should die of hunger, and whether there was any change. Therefore he wished to emulate the two great worthies Bo Yi and Shu Qi, and become one who knows his fate and obeys Heaven. When Changchun had finished, Brother Zhao laughed aloud, ‘Old master need not be so; since you fear to die of hunger, we brothers will each contribute two taels of silver, which will make more than ten taels. You may find a temple to live in, take a disciple, and all of us work diligently, amassing food and grain; how can you suffer hunger?’ Before Zhao Bi finished speaking, Zhang Jian and Li Xiong took out several small pieces of silver, amounting to three or four taels, while the others were all to give silver. Qiu Changchun shook his head and waved his hands to refuse, saying he never took others’ wealth without cause, and had a talisman to prove it.

Having said this, he took out the talisman and showed it to them; on it were written words condemning those who take others’ wealth without cause, or eat others’ food, to broken bones and sores in the mouth. Wang Neng laughed and said, ‘We brothers willingly help you with some silver; it is not that you demand it from us. How can this be wrongful?’ Qiu Changchun said, ‘Whatever is gained without merit is without cause. Without cause is without reason. To take money and food from others without cause, is it not wrongful?’ Zhu Jiu said, ‘Though it be lawful to kill a man by worldly law, and impossible to live by Buddha’s law, we help you with some silver and you dare not accept it, fearing to err in taking it. We live by robbing and plundering, yet we know not how great our guilt is.’ Qiu Changchun replied, ‘You are different from me; I in my former life did not help others at all, therefore in this life I cannot endure others’ offerings. You, on the other hand, in your former life lent freely and received compensation, and thus those whom you deceived now come to waylay you and demand double payment. If you do not owe much to others, you will not meet them in this way; and even if you pass by, you will lightly let them go.’

Qiu Changchun’s words caused all thirteen of them to shudder. Li Xiong said, ‘Remarkable! Remarkable! According to this Daoist, does it mean that everyone owes less to us? We may not have less debts to others. If we owe less to others, then in another life others will waylay us to demand payment—only that we may not be cleared.’ Zhao Bi said, ‘We all have some silver now, and may do some small business to live out our days. Let us take this opportunity to amend our ways and return from evil. What do you all say?’ Zhu Jiu said, ‘Brother’s words are reasonable; let us resolve to collect our hearts here.’ Saying so, he cast his knife into the tangled grass. Zhao Bi further said to Changchun, ‘Old master, cultivate well, for we brothers will surely come to worship you as master, to learn the wondrous Way.’ Saying this, they all left.

Yet Qiu Changchun was seized by the demon of hunger to die; though rescued by Zhao Bi and the others, the root of the demon remained, and he still sought death. Leaving the place, after more than a month he gathered some two or three hundred cash, bought an iron chain and an iron lock, carried them with him, and sought a place. He found a temple remote and pathless, surrounded by woods deep within the mountains, where men do not come. ‘Ancient trees towered to the sky, with thorns all over the ground.’ He fastened the chain to a big tree, made a loop, and tied it about his neck, locking it, and threw the key into the air, not knowing where it fell. Then he lay down beneath the tree, saying to himself that now there was no more desire for life. 

Who would have thought that this act had already startled the celestial Lord of Venus, who changed himself into a herb-gatherer, came near, and asked, ‘Old master, what crime have you committed? Who has tied you to this tree?’ Repeating his question several times, Qiu Changchun at last spoke, ‘Go about your business, and do not trouble yourself about me.’ The herb-gatherer said, ‘The affairs of the world are to be dealt with by all men. How can I not trouble myself about you? I too am a man who understands the Way; tell me your thoughts, and I will explain them to you in detail, perhaps to relieve your burden and remove your sorrow.’ Changchun saw the reason in his words, and told the fortune-teller Ma Yi’s prediction of his death by starvation from the beginning, and also his many attempts to seek death but being rescued. He told how he had come here to bind himself to the tree, showing that he had no desire to live, so as to avoid rescue, and that he had no sorrow to share.

The herb-gatherer laughed heartily, saying, ‘Foolish, foolish! Such extreme delusion of the heart! I fear you have some worry about Heaven and Earth, but it is truly a single thought that has entered the demon, misleading you for life. I have come to speak with you, that your demon may be dispelled. The physiognomy that determines one’s life is fixed for ordinary men; but for those of great goodness or great evil it is not fixed. The features are divided inside and out—there is the mental form, and there is the facial form; the outward form is not equal to the inward form. A good destiny is not as good as a good heart. The appearance of the good man changes with his heart. When the heart is good, the appearance is also good. Those who should die yet live long, meet misfortune and turn it to good, encounter danger and find auspiciousness. The appearance of the great evil man also changes with his heart. When the heart is bad, the appearance is also bad. Those who should have a good end die an evil death, turning fortune into calamity, joy into sorrow. Therefore the secret of physiognomy says, ‘To have long life and fortune is to be born of loyalty and kindness; to have a brief life is surely to be frivolous.’ Those who should be poor and lowly yet turn rich and honourable do so because their hearts cherish the saving of the world; those who should be rich and honourable yet become poor and lowly do so because their purpose is selfish gain. Those who should die of hunger yet have more than enough food do so because they cherish their grain; those who should have more than enough food yet suffer hunger do so because they squander the five grains. The insect Si Yanqing is one who must have the virtue of loving life; to lack descendants is to have no heart of mercy. This is the great outline of the mental physiognomy. What can the facial physiognomy do? Moreover, you who cultivate the Way can turn Fate and Creation, overturn Heaven and Earth, and transform a mortal body into an immortal one. Are immortals necessarily fixed by physiognomy? It is all by the work of the heart’s cultivation and enlightenment. As long as you can attain the status of an immortal, which immortal might starve to death? If you act thus, you will be born a hungry ghost, and die a hungry ghost. Life is useless, and death is no benefit!’

These words were as if a dream suddenly awakened, as if darkness suddenly brightened, and Qiu Changchun at last knew that his desire for death was like that of a woman or a child, not the mind of a true man, and was indeed worthy of shame. He desired to cast off the lock, but lacking the key, it was unknown whether he could truly free himself. Let us see what follows in the next chapter.

A thousand truths and wondrous principles, one place not reached and one place lost.
