# Chapter Twenty-Four: The Bitter Root Follows the Heart’s Change — The Yin Demons Arise as Illusions from Human Life

After the Lantern Festival, no more lamps remain;  
Through all ages, only this heart shines ever bright.

It brightly lights the heavens, never extinguished;  
Its clear radiance endures even to this day.

It is told that Qiu Changchun, hearing the words of the herb-gatherer, as if awakened from a dream by a sudden blow, then knew that past events were like the childish understanding of a child, not the act of a mature man. He hastened to break loose from his bonds, yet knew not where the key might be, and his mind was greatly anxious. The herb-gatherer said: ‘The key I have found.’ And taking it from his sleeve, he opened the lock. Qiu Changchun said: ‘I am a man already dead; by your few words you have opened my path, and at the brink of death given me life anew. The grace is beyond measure.’ The herb-gatherer answered: ‘I have not given you silver or food; only a few words of counsel to persuade you. Whether you believe or not depends on yourself. If you can believe, then you may not die; if you do not believe, you cannot live. The words “life” and “death” are fashioned by yourself; what concern have they of me? What grace is there to speak of?’ Saying this, he floated away, and in an instant was not to be seen.

From that time forth, Qiu Changchun put away the thought of seeking death, as if a cloud of mist dispersed and all was clear; still the blue sky and white sun remained, the heavens serene and boundless, without the slightest hindrance. Had it not been for the one treatise of Lord Tai Bai, which uprooted his demon root, no host of a million heavenly soldiers, nor a thousand Wei Tuo (guardian deities) breaking their demon-subduing maces, could have driven away his magical obstructions or uprooted that root of evil. Therefore, as a rule, when the demon obstruction comes to a cultivator, one must seek out its root, and see whence it arises, and lightly pluck it away at its source, without effort. If the demon takes root here, you seek for its shoot elsewhere, and all your life shall not find it. You may say all the good words in the world, but if you do not touch his heart’s illness, he will not submit to you.

After the herb-gatherer pointed out the lost path, Qiu Changchun re-established the profound work, and again undertook bitter practice. One day, while at a certain place, he saw the mountains and rivers full of grace and beauty, and a creek crossed the road by its side. It was midsummer, and the creek’s waters were full and swollen; the river was level and did not admit of a bridge, nor could a boat be built; so he had to wade across. The villagers near knew the waters well, crossing back and forth without concern; but travellers from afar, standing by the bank, sighed and dared not lightly ford the waters. Qiu Changchun then conceived a thought to perform some bitter work and act with convenience; those who could not cross the water he would carry across on his back. Some generous persons gave him a few coins to buy food, so he could get by for a day or two; others took no coin, but also carried him across. When the waters receded and he lacked supplies, he went to seek alms, taking morning alms from seven families and evening alms from eight; gathering them in due course, and when he met with starving or cold persons, he gave them food and endured hunger himself. If rain or snow blocked the way, he would go all day without eating. Over the course of several years, he was hungry over a hundred times. Hence the saying: ‘Great hunger comes seventy-two times; small hunger countless times.’

In this way Qiu Changchun did bitter work, lodging at a cold temple at night. On the temple plaque were the words that the disciples of the many surnames of Xixi had respectfully presented it, so he knew that this river was named Shixi. Suddenly he recalled the words of Master Chongyang by the bank of the Shifan Creek, that the bitter root and wealth end here. Then he greatly strengthened his perseverance, contemplating the marvel of the Way, and in leisure sat in meditation and applied effort. Thus for six years he repeatedly encountered hardship, beyond what words can tell; yet when the water and mountains had come to their end, he was moved to find kindly persons who made a good connection with him, so he could somewhat escape hunger and cold.

Heaven does not fail those who cultivate, only fearing that the heart of cultivation be not sincere.

If the heart be true and bitterly awakened to the Way, why fear that clothes and food shall not last a lifetime?

Having practiced bitterly for six years, when the time came for fulfilment, suddenly the creek waters rose greatly, and three men appeared, clad in military dress, each bearing a copper knife and holding a human head, saying they had captured great thieves and must report to the capital. Not knowing the water’s nature, they asked him to carry them across the river. Changchun had come to do bitter labour and could not refuse to carry them. He bore the first and second across, but the third was timid and fearful, saying, ‘I have always feared the water; be careful.’ Changchun answered, ‘No matter, do not be afraid,’ and took him upon his back. At the river’s midstream, where the waters ran swift, suddenly a wave struck; Changchun’s footing was unsteady, and he was pushed by the wave, his body jolted; the soldier cried out ‘Alas!’ and clutched at his clothes. In a twist, the human head fell into the water. The soldier exclaimed, ‘What is to be done? What is to be done?’ Changchun looked and saw the head drifting with the current. Hastily, he brought the soldier to the shore and sought the head, but looking about, the waves rolled and the flood surged; whither could he seek that head? Where could he fish that head out? When he looked again at the soldier, the man beat his breast and stamped his feet, calling on heaven and earth in panic. Changchun’s heart was troubled and confused, and he had no settled plan. Then he said to the soldier, ‘Bring your knife, and let me cut off my own head to repay you for your lost one; how say you?’ The soldier replied, ‘The head was lost by my own hand; it has nothing to do with you.’ Changchun said, ‘I am alone and death is fitting; you have a family of several mouths who live by this. Brother, if I live, your whole family lives; is that not well?’ The soldier said, ‘You are indeed kind-hearted, but I cannot bear to kill you. It is said that though a steel knife is sharp, it does not strike the innocent. If you would have my great matter settled, you must take your own life.’

Saying this, he handed the knife to Changchun, who took it in hand and was about to cut his throat, when suddenly a voice cried out in mid-air: ‘Qiu Changchun, return my wù!’ Changchun looked up and saw three military officers standing amid five-coloured auspicious clouds, who said, ‘We three are the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Seeing your steadfast heart in the Way and your bitter practice fulfilled, we come specially to transform and save you. Because you indeed sacrifice yourself for others and accumulate merit and practice, now your mortal body shall be changed into the body of the Way, your illusory form transformed into the immortal form. The six years’ enlightenment is complete; the seventh year will bring your true accomplishment. Be diligent and do not err.’ Changchun’s heart was suddenly clear and enlightened, his spirit bright; looking again, he held in his hand a leaf of cháo wù (a kind of herb), and not a steel knife. Among the Three Officials, one was barehanded; this was his own cháo wù. He could not but ascend and return it, and so he leapt upward and entered the clouds, presenting the leaf. The Three Officials, seated on their golden clouds, rose slowly and departed. Changchun, about to descend from the clouds, suddenly thought of the hemp-clad soldiers who had doomed him to die of hunger. Now that his Way fruit was accomplished and his body could no longer endure hunger, why not use this cloud to journey east of the river and test their sight? Having resolved this, he turned the cloud and in an instant arrived before the hemp-clad village, alighted from the clouds, and entered the village, where he saw a youth of about twenty years, the same boy who once brought out food. He said, ‘I have come to seek the old gentleman for a physiognomy reading.’ The youth said, ‘My master has long not gone out; if you wish a reading, come with me to the hall.’ Saying this, he led Changchun inside. There, the hemp-clad man sat in the hall; seeing Changchun enter, he rose hurriedly and welcomed him with the courtesy due a guest, seating him and offering tea. Changchun saw the hemp-clad man’s hair and beard were all white and aged, and said, ‘Several years gone by, sir, and now your hair has turned white as snow.’ The hemp-clad man said, ‘This old man knows not where I met the Daoist; for a time, I forgot the way.’ Qiu Changchun said: ‘Sir, do you not remember the teng snake locking the mouth, the one doomed to die of hunger?’ Hearing this, the hemp-clad man examined his face and clapped his hands, laughing heartily: ‘Excellent! Excellent! Daoist, you know not where you have performed great merit, for you have changed the physiognomy of the past.’ Changchun said, ‘Sir, you once said that the physiognomy is fixed for life and never changed; how now do you say it is changed?’ The hemp-clad physiognomist said, ‘This old man only knows physiognomy, not the heart. Now your physiognomy follows the heart’s change; this old man knows it not. Formerly the double lines at the mouth’s entrance were called the teng snake locking the mouth, indicating a fate to die of hunger. Now these two lines have divided, and encircle the cheng jiang position; upon this cheng jiang is born a small red mole. This pattern is called Two Dragons Presenting the Pearl; it indicates noble rank beyond words, and one who shall receive imperial offerings, with blessings and fortune beyond measure. How could a foolish old man know this!’ Changchun heard and was convinced that his physiognomy spoke with spirit, and took leave and arose.

Returning to the temple at Shifan Creek, he sat in meditation, but because he had moved a little in scheming to mock the hemp-clad man, he brought forth a demon obstruction. While sitting in meditation, in a vague state between life and death, as if in a thousand mountains, suddenly a wild wind rose, revealing a fierce yellow-spotted tiger, baring teeth and brandishing claws, rushing upon him. He viewed death lightly and was not moved. Then, in the deep darkness, he saw a Taoist boy say: ‘My master Ma Danyang has come; the senior uncle does not yet rise to meet him.’ Indeed, Danyang came from below. Changchun thought: ‘The Way does not cling to affections; coming and going are as they will.’ Suddenly many people said: ‘You have borne us across the river; now at harvest time, we give you one shi and more of wheat, enough for a year’s food; also two strings of copper coins, and a garment to wear.’ Saying this, they piled wheat before him and brought the coins to his side, urging him to take them in his own hand. He paid no heed. In his dazed state, he saw a fair young maiden of about seventeen or eighteen, who said she was beaten by her stepmother and had fled secretly to go to her uncle’s house, but being alone could not go far, and begged the old master to send her on, saying her gratitude would be profound. Saying this, she was delicate and tearful, yet Changchun paid no attention, remaining as one with no self and no other, knowing not or unknown. In a flash, the second sister-in-law came with several children, saying: ‘Your second brother has died; the eldest uncle has taken the estate for himself, so your nephews and nieces have neither lasting clothes nor daily food. I am but a woman; how can I support them? Consider your elder brother, and pity the flesh and bone; how shall we and the children be settled?’ Saying this, the children pulled and tugged, crying and wailing, the third uncle scolding and shouting, wanting food and drink, digging and grabbing at random. In the midst of stillness, wisdom arose suddenly in Changchun; as if nothing were there, he suddenly heard a clear voice from mid-air, and the Southern Heavenly Gate opened wide, seeing two boys leading a white crane before him, saying: ‘By command of Jade Dispersion, the True Man is to mount the crane and ascend.’ — To be continued.

Let not the three mortal realms create illusory worlds;  
Guard against the six thieves disturbing the heart’s field.
