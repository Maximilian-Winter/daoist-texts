# Chapter Twenty-Nine: Receiving the Alchemical Edict, the Seven Perfected Ones Attain True Fruition; Repairing to the Jade Pool, the Assembly of Immortals Celebrate the Peaches of Immortality

Having attained the Great Way, one emerges from error; only then can one be reckoned a true man of the world.

The sun and moon shine together, eternal and unending; Heaven and Earth grow old as the Mysterious Capital flourishes.

It is said of those boastful brethren of the Way, that when the West Wind Temple is built, we shall erect outside the sanctuary a screen wall. Since anciently it is said, ‘The Way fears the wind, the wind fears the wall,’ this wall shall serve as a fan; when the wind comes, it shall be fanned back, and the wind will return whence it came—this is called the returning wind. Before the tale was finished, Zhu Jiu, who robs travellers upon Mount Zaoling, shouted loudly beside them, ‘If you can but return the wind, then I will set fire and burn it all to a clean desolation.’ Wang, seeing his arrogant manner, hastened to rebuke him, saying, ‘The temple is not yet built; what need to burn it? When it is built, then it is not too late to burn it!’ At these words the brethren of the Way laughed together. Yet who would have thought that some meddlesome Daoist would carry these words abroad, gossiping between Zhang and Li, and as the years passed, the tale became a jest. The story was reported untruly, but taken as fact; it was said that the monks built a West Wind Temple to scatter the White Cloud Sanctuary, but a Daoist employed a shabby charm to bring back the wind and return the fire, and burnt the West Wind Temple to ashes. But this was not so. On one side was a meddlesome monk, and on the other a talkative Daoist; one said this, the other said that, stirring up those who love to create trouble, and so it became a tale of ridicule. Many old practitioners native to the capital could not make the matter clear. Now, by comparison with ancient texts, this is corrected without error, that future disciples may not contend over superiority or inferiority, and thereby the cause and effect may shine clear.

Since ancient times, false reports are not to be trusted; talking and talking, they grow ever more absurd.

Present men take them as true events, and often disparage the ancients for their length or shortness of days.

It is further said, that after Master Qiu became reconciled with Chan Master of the White Clouds, during his quiet cultivation he refined his labours through ninety-nine times eighty-one transformations, which is to say, the ninety-nine and eighty-one hardships. Using true nature and original feelings, the restless monkey mind, he made them his own. The seven emotions and six desires, the three corpses and six devils, as external demons invading and seizing, he set down in a great book called the Journey to the West. Upon completion, he sent a Daoist boy to the Jixian Hall, presenting it to the Chan Master of the White Clouds. This Chan Master was a man of great wisdom; with a single glance he understood. He then set down the scenes within the cave, the subtle uses within stillness, the thirty-six paths of external demons attacking the self with wisdom and supernatural power, producing transformations of birth and conquest; composing a great book called The Investiture of the Gods. He also sent a novice monk to the White Cloud Sanctuary to deliver it to Master Qiu. Henceforth the two schools reconciled; the Chan Master, now possessed of complete powers, flew to the south to expound the teachings. This one Immortal and one Buddha thus wrote the Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods, eternal for all ages, their wondrous uses infinite.

These two great books conceal profound mysteries; their illusions arise from man’s making, their principles from the natural course.

From among the seven emotions and six desires arise disorder, producing myriad demon kings unnumbered.

It is also said that Master Qiu, having opened a platform to preach at the White Cloud Sanctuary, discoursed upon precepts and greatly opened the gate to deliver the world; he renewed the Dao of Quanzhen, establishing rules and regulations to warn later generations. He also composed instructive writings to be left for posterity, opening seventy-two monastic retreats, linking the mysterious descendants through hundreds of millions of years; three thousand meritorious fruits, eight hundred fulfilled deeds, responding to the choice of Zhao Zifu, to become an Immortal of the Great Luo. On the nineteenth day of the tenth month, the Alchemical Scriptures sent an edict; mounting a crane, he ascended to heaven. At that time, clouds glowed with rosy light, purple vapours rose true; pairs of Golden Boys came to escort, pairs of Jade Maidens to guide his progress; a gentle breeze stirred, banners and flags danced midair, clear music rang aloud; within the clouds celestial music echoed with clangour. In an instant he left the capital, and in a moment arrived at the Southern Heavenly Gate. Wang, Ma, Yin, and Zhao saluted with hands clasped; Zhang, Ge, Xu, and Sa smiled to welcome. They paid homage before the Supreme at the Golden Palace, viewing the heavenly countenance in the royal court, bowing low beneath the Jade Steps, and making obeisance before the Lingxiao Hall, proclaiming: ‘Long live our Emperor without limit! Great is the virtue of the Sovereign, loving all life.’ The Supreme Emperor, seeing him, was greatly pleased, and commanded the Three Officials to examine his merits in the hall, recommending the Seven Perfected Ones: ‘Their merits are commendable. After examining their diligent practice of inner and outer works, Qiu Changchun ranks first. Liu Changsheng, versed in profound mysteries of the boundless Great Ultimate, stands second. Tan Changzhen, his heart steadfast in the Dao, ranks third. Ma Danyang, pure and tranquil in non-action, fourth. Hao Taigu, unstained as a single dust particle, fifth. Wang Yuyang, with all thought at rest, sixth. Sun Buer, wise and complete, the first to initiate practice, his merits greatest, should be supreme. Yet to show modesty, he is placed seventh. Complete at beginning and end, the fruit of the Seven Perfected Ones. The Purple Palace has inscribed their names; now I dare report this.’ Having finished the report, the heavenly countenance was pleased, and one by one decreed the titles of the Seven Perfected Ones. Qiu Changchun was made Celestial Immortal Champion, selected by the Purple Palace, Supreme Master of Quanzhen, True Lord of Divine Transformation and Response. Liu Changsheng was made True Lord of Profound Tranquility and Hidden Virtue. Tan Changzhen was made True Lord of Ancestral Profound Bright Virtue. Ma Danyang was made True Lord of Non-action and Universal Transformation. Hao Taigu was made True Lord of Thorough Profound Wondrous Extremes. Wang Yuyang was made True Lord of Broad Compassion and Universal Salvation. Sun Buer was made Primordial Lord of Profound Emptiness and Harmonious Transformation.

When all were enfeoffed and honored, six of the men, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun, all expressed thanks; only Qiu Changchun refused to thank. The Three Officials cried aloud: ‘Why does Qiu Changchun not thank?’ Master Qiu bowed low beneath the Jade Steps, tears streaming, and humbly reported: ‘It is not that I refuse to thank, but because the Dao is originally hard to learn, Immortalhood is not easily attained. Those who cultivate and learn the Dao in later ages, like me, enduring countless hardships without turning back from the first resolve, are one in ten thousand. Goodness is the hardest to learn; without learning goodness, the Dao cannot be completed. I have composed a chapter on the difficulty of learning goodness to report. “To awaken to the Dao is not easy; learning goodness is hardest. The task of learning goodness is for those not endowed with great strength to attempt. One must be able to endure hunger and cold, endure shame and disgrace; sometimes without clothing for a lifetime, sometimes without food for a day; two meals cut off daily, unable to sleep through the night; no day without incurring dislike, repeatedly insulted; the words are sour, the hearing chills the heart. I have experienced a thousand forms of hardship, and so know the difficulty of learning goodness. One single word, goodness, is hard to learn; how can I dare to hope for Immortality? I fear that those in later ages who cultivate and awaken will not endure such hardships, having the name of learning the Dao, but not the substance of learning the Dao, leaving me no way to save them, and thus failing the grace of our Emperor’s honored conferral. Therefore I dare not thank. I humbly beg pardon.’’

Master Qiu, having thus reported the difficulty of learning goodness to the Emperor, the assembly of immortals was silent. Presently, from the western great hall came forth a star lord—can you guess his appearance?

He was born with red hair, red face, red beard, red heart; clad in golden helmet, golden armour, golden bricks, golden whip; his feet tread upon three or five fiery chariots, pursuing wind and chasing lightning; he subdues demons and captures monsters; he investigates without partiality, known as the Iron-faced Thunder Lord, guardian of the law, jointly revering the Primordial Spirit Ancestor. It is said the Spirit Ancestor stood beside him. Hearing Master Qiu’s report that those who learn goodness endure many hardships without protection, he took it to heart and desired to become guardian deity. Then he loudly cried: ‘Qiu Changchun, you may thank now. In future, if there be those who cultivate the Dao, men of learning, if they have three parts cultivation, I respond seven parts; if they have ten parts cultivation, I will at all times watch over them. There will be offerings and sacrifices made; they shall not endure hunger or cold.’ Hearing the Star Lord’s words, Master Qiu then thanked him, and with a bow gave a burdensome load weighing thousands of catties upon the Star Lord’s shoulder.

Soon after, the Supreme Emperor retired from the hall, and the assembly of immortals dispersed. The Seven Perfected Ones accompanied the Emperor of the Eastern Florescence to pay reverence to the Ancestor Donghua, Master Zhongli, and Master Dongbin; they also bowed to their teacher, Master Zhongyang. The Emperor of Eastern Florescence caused Master Zixia to lead the Seven Perfected Ones to the Hall of Decorum to study the rites of the Jade Pool, for soon the Peach Banquet would be held, and they would with joy pay homage to the High Perfected.

When the time of the assembly arrived, the Emperor of Eastern Florescence led the newly advanced Immortals—the Southern Sect and the Northern School, the Five Manifestations and the Seven Perfected Ones—towards the Jade Pool. From afar they beheld the jade mansions, the golden towers, the silver palaces; coral railings, steps of red jade, the mingling of gold and blue, the dazzling brilliance of vermilion and purple; auspicious light dazzled the eyes, fragrant aromas abounded. Among the jade groves and jade trees, phoenixes and vermilions danced; beneath golden pillars and silver pedestals, tigers roared and dragons sang; mysterious cranes, plum deer, blue lions, white elephants, all formed pairs. Phoenix carriages, dragon chariots, phoenix chairs, crane steeds—none in the world match these pairs. Inexpressible is the solemnity of the Jade Pool, ineffable the beauty of Kunlun.

Meanwhile, the Emperor of Eastern Florescence led the newly advanced immortals to pay respects to the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother received them as honoured guests. Soon the holy perfected came together like clouds. The Queen Mother received them, and after inquiries and responses, according to the ancient rules of assemblies, each had their order. Only the newly advanced perfected must await the arrangement of the host. The Queen Mother said: ‘The newly arrived immortals, unable to each pay a visit to the Supreme Saint, may now proceed to stand at the Alchemical Pool, bowing thrice upwards, thus sharing one body.’ The Queen Mother having given this instruction, the Emperor of Eastern Florescence led the assembly to kneel on the jade steps. After nine kowtows in royal ritual, the Queen Mother assigned each to their place. Heavenly music played, songs and dances of the multicoloured Tang, the banquets with rare delicacies indescribable, all beyond the realm of the mortal world. Many immortal children passed cups of wine; countless jade maidens lifted the goblets and poured the wine. Tens of boys carried purple bamboo baskets, flying aloft to the tree tops, plucking the crickets’ peaches, from above to below, in a moment filling the baskets and trays. Immortal officials and attendants passed them about; soon the hall was full. The largest were selected to present to the Heavenly Lord and Great Sage; the next to offer to the Great Luo Golden Immortals and the true gods of the three realms; the next were distributed as rewards to the attendants and guards of the Peng Isles. These peaches are not easy to eat; only those with cultivation may obtain them. Future disciples aspiring to these peaches must also, like the Seven Perfected Ones, apply themselves with earnest mind and diligence, cultivate and attain the Dao and become perfected. Paying homage to the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, she will surely grant you a pan tao. Eating one peach grants a thousand years of life, forever youthful and immortal. When the assembly concluded, the myriad perfected and holy ones all returned to the Heavenly Palace. The Seven Perfected Ones followed the Emperor of Eastern Florescence back to the Purple Palace. This Purple Palace lies on the Fangzhu Mountains, which resemble Kunlun but are not so high or grand. Within too are grasses ever green throughout the four seasons, flowers that never wither through the eight festivals. It is reckoned the foremost realm of the Heavenly Palace, yet not easily reached. A poem says:

The fruit of cause and effect of the Seven Perfected flows forever;  
They endure infinite hardship in the human world.  
Only hoping that we learn the wondrous mystery,  
Thus surely becoming free immortals in heaven.
