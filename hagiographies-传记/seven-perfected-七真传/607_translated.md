# Chapter Eight: Master Chongyang's Southern Journey and the Encounter with the Dao; Wang Xiaoxian's Northern Turning and Meeting the True Master

Verses say:

The world's affairs are busy as if mourning a dog;  
The world's manners are hot and cold, in a moment nothing remains.  
The people all pursue the flying crow;  
I now do not fall into the hand of impermanence.  
Why then bear a body drifting in the bitter sea?  
Wealth, honor, and glory — how can they be enjoyed long?  
Now having discerned the gate of right and wrong,  
At last must not be behind others.  
(Adapted to the tune "Butterfly Loves Flowers")

It is told that Hao Taigu, having heard the words of his master, asked of the Way: "The disciple has heard the master's words that to cultivate the correct Way, one must first practice the Three Refuges, and thereafter observe the Five Precepts. Yet I do not understand what the Three Refuges and Five Precepts are; I beg the master to instruct." Chongyang said: "The Three Refuges are explained thus: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha in Buddhism; the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master in Daoism. In sum, they are the essence, energy, and spirit within oneself. Therefore, to take refuge in the Way is to abandon desire and respect it, thereby forever escaping the cycle of rebirth. The cultivator of the Way always guards the original nature and primal spirit, abiding in the ground of nature, not allowing thoughts and vain imaginings to disturb the lord of the mind. The external appearances do not enter, nor does the internal aspect go forth, so that the conscious spirit naturally transforms into the primordial spirit that is neither born nor perishes, nourished for a long time, thus escaping the suffering and vexations of the river of love and sea of desire. When the fruit of the Way is perfected, one can escape the birth and death of the six realms of transmigration; is this not to depart from the honor of desire and thought?  
To take refuge in the Scriptures, the two-legged honor, is to hear the true Dharma. The true cultivators of the great Way fear that the primordial spirit has nowhere to rely, falling into illusory emptiness and unable to firmly tread the solid ground. Therefore, the Supreme One transmitted thirty-six revered Scriptures, the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye, so that one may reach the path of true cultivation, have something to cultivate and realize, not be confused by heterodox Shuras, nor fall into side paths, but naturally refine and nurture the primordial energy and assist the transformation of the primal spirit. This has the sacred honor of the divine energy with two legs, and one can obtain the great Way of longevity and lasting vision; therefore there is true Dharma to be heard.  
To take refuge in the Master, the honored among the many, is to avoid heretical views. Nowadays, there are many heterodox paths and numerous side ways: some employ transporting essence, opening and closing gates, supplementing the brain; some swallow saliva and absorb qi, take in qi and eat the rosy clouds; some use the art of battle; some practice the skill of taming women; some point to the one acupoint at the root of the nose as the mysterious gate, and regard the two eyes as yin and yang; some treat five metals and eight stones as supreme treasures, claiming they are lead and mercury within the body; some recite mantras and Buddha names, strike seven to refine demons; some maintain spirit in silence and meditate, guiding out the yin spirit; others fast entirely, burn reeds and refine mercury — all sorts of strange side paths beyond measure. Altogether these belong to the bonds of illusion and transformation of the body, making it difficult to transcend the mundane and become a sage.  
Therefore, one must obtain the secret formulas of a true master: refine essence into qi, refine qi to nurture spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness; when the yang spirit appears, it leaps beyond the heaven above heaven, united with the Great Void, shining as the sun and moon. Heaven and Earth may perish, but my body will not perish; hence it is called the Golden Immortal undying through myriad kalpas. This is called sage, called immortal, called Buddha — is it not the most honored among the many?  
Thus, not falling into heretical and deluded views, one knows there is a true Way to cultivate. All cultivators constantly keep the three treasures within the body ever present, not allowing them to dissipate — this is called the ‘ever-present three treasures.’ Nowadays these common monks and laypeople do not understand the function of the three treasures within themselves. They mistake temples and monasteries for the ever-present, and three Buddhas and three Pure Ones for the three treasures. Who knows that the three Buddhas and three Pure Ones are also other names for the three treasures within oneself? To respect the three treasures within oneself is to respect the three Buddhas and three Pure Ones. To recite Buddha and heavenly worthies is to recite one’s own mind. If the self’s mind is not upright, even if one recites hundreds of thousands daily, it is like a fish chewing water — of what use is it?  
Only if one esteems the three treasures and does not arise various thoughts, even reciting ten thousand scrolls of scriptures is not equal to sitting in stillness for one moment. Having taken refuge in the three treasures, one must abolish the five precepts of killing, stealing, licentiousness, wine, and falsehood. Holding steadfastly to these three refuges and carefully guarding the five precepts, only then may one discuss the Way."  

Hearing this, Taigu trembled with awe and dared not disobey. Having worshipped the master and fellow brothers and friends, he returned to the elixir chamber to rest quietly. The narrative will not further describe this.  

It is told that since Chongyang's rain prayer was fulfilled, far and near the fame spread, and the number of disciples coming to seek instruction increased day by day. Among them were Fang Demao of Yanjing, Nie Daoming of Yangzhou, Han Xiudao of Laizhou, Bai Yuanliang, as well as hundreds of lay followers who took refuge. The master, wearied of the multitude, wished to travel to Zhongnan, intending to take Danyang to Kunlun. Fearing the monastery would not be quiet, he commanded Danyang and others to manage the monastery affairs. Danyang and the others bowed farewell, asking the master the date of his return. Chongyang said: "Your master shall return in the twelfth lunar month." With that he parted from the crowd, departing lightly.  

Upon reaching Mount Hua of the Western Peak, it happened that Xue Zixian was about to return to Tiantai, sitting to transcend at Jade Maiden Peak, leaving a stanza:  
Iron horses rush through the human sea;  
Mud dragons fly up to the heavens.  
The way to the three Isles of Penglai  
Is not to the west.  

Chongyang and his disciples placed the remains in the shrine, set fire to burn them, and obtained countless hardened seeds among the sand and gravel.  

Chongyang wished to ascend Zhongnan, and upon arriving at Chang’an met He Yuyan. They conversed on cold and warm, and the two ascended Zhongnan together. Just then, the two masters were inside a cave refining elixirs. Chongyang led Yuzhan to pay respects to the immortal masters. Immortals Zhong and Lü were pleased, and said to He Yuzhan: "You two have deep roots and solid foundations; to attain the great Way you must also accumulate merit and conduct; in future days you will surely ascend to the rank of immortal." Yuzhan said: "This disciple wishes to accumulate merit but does not know what merit to accumulate; I beg the master to instruct." Lüzu said: "In the coming early spring of the Southern Song there will be pestilence; I will transmit to you methods to drive away the plague, so that you may go help people and benefit all, accumulating merit and achievements." Yuzhan bowed in thanks. Chongyang detailed matters concerning Ma, Sun, Tan, and Qiu. Master Zhong said: "You may cross the seven golden lotuses of Qi before you can respond to the summons to ascend." Chongyang and Yuzhan bowed and took leave, Yuzhan going to rescue souls in Wu and Yue. The narrative will not further describe this.  

Chongyang bade farewell to the two immortals and returned to Quanzhen Monastery where the multitude welcomed him. After the New Year, Chongyang again instructed Danyang and others to watch the temple, and commanded Changzhen and Taigu to accompany him on a journey southward. At that time, Chujī wished to follow the master as attendant, and stepped forward to report: "The disciple desires to follow the master outside as attendant; may I know the master's intention?" Chongyang made no answer but called Changzhen and Taigu to prepare for departure. The disciples all accompanied them for five li before halting.  

Changzhen and Taigu journeyed with the master, Chujī following behind. After twenty li they rested at a pavilion. Chongyang saw Fuyang approaching, and called to Taigu to fetch the disciplinary rod. Taigu asked: "What use does the master have for the rod?" Chongyang said: "Chujī has violated my pure rules; strike him forty blows." Changzhen and Taigu knelt together to plead, and he gave Chujī twenty strokes of the rod, then rose and departed.  

After journeying another five li or so, Chongyang said: "I feel some hunger in the belly and dryness in the mouth; there is nothing to buy on this stretch of road; fetching water to quench thirst will do." Hearing this, Fuyang hastened with gourd and ladle to seek water. But this road leads toward Yanzhou; having gone far without finding water, he returned to the master. Chongyang angrily said: "This fellow is lazy and does not know where to fetch water or not." He pointed with a branch: "Is this not water?" Changzhen and Taigu saw a pond by the roadside, and quickly fetched water to quench the master's thirst. Chongyang drank and then struck Chujī's head with his staff; Changzhen and Taigu intervened and persuaded, and then they proceeded on the road.  

Fuyang thought in his heart: "I searched everywhere and found none; yet by the roadside there is water — how strange!" He went to fetch water and suddenly disappeared. He understood clearly: "This water was produced by my master’s enlightenment; therefore when I went to fetch water, it vanished." Seeing them depart afar, he hastened after. The road was not right here or there; certainly something was amiss. Having been bewitched over a month, Fuyang remained diligent and attentive, never leaving their sides.  

Arriving at Jiangning, they rested at Santai Cave overnight, suddenly seeing great snow fall from heaven. Chongyang said: "These days are cold with snow; you all should fetch more dry firewood to make a fire." The three obeyed, climbing mountains and digging ridges to bring much dry wood to the cave. They went to the marketplace to exchange money and buy small dishes, cooking the meal in the cave and eating it. Chongyang ordered a fire to be set and sat down. The three burned it fiercely, the heat was intense and the smoke nearly suffocated them; Chongyang sat upright, majestic and unmoving. Fuyang and Taigu opened the door and went out to cool themselves; Chongyang ordered Changzhen to close the door and forbid their reentry. Outside the door, the two froze miserably and dared not disturb the master. They sat back to back, enduring the night bitterly. At dawn, Changzhen opened the door, seeing the two frozen pitifully, saying: "I wished to open the door, but the master forbade it. You freeze outside in sorrow, and I suffer near death from smoke within." The three brothers then made food. After eating, Chongyang ordered them to set out. Seeing the heavy snow, they dared not disobey and packed up to leave. At this time, the three were bewitched and thrown into chaos, yet had no trace of hatred or resentment, and so they braved the snow toward Suzhou. The narrative will not further describe this.  

Now it is told that within the Changan Gate of Suzhou Prefecture’s Tianqing Temple lived a Daoist named He Zhongli, of lofty virtue and conduct. He was once a scholar of Huaiyang, who came suddenly to Suzhou and dwelt in the temple. His speech was as if feigning madness; over time all agreed. Sick persons petitioned him for cures; he prescribed decoctions of a single reed of cape grass, and the sick recovered. Those who would not comply remained ill. The people called him “Cape Grass True Man.” In the spring of the year Wuzi, the emperor sent an imperial attendant with fragrant tea to Suzhou, saying only that the court had matters to inquire. He Zhongli shook his head and said: "Where there are Chinese there are barbarians; where there is sun there is moon." The attendant reported this. The emperor said: "He truly knows my heart." Thus he was bestowed the title Tongshen Xiansheng (Master of Communicating with the Spirits).  

At that time Chongyang and his three disciples came to Suzhou to travel, and having heard of He Zhongli’s way, went to visit him. Chongyang discoursed on the subtlety of returning spirit to emptiness, and He Zhongli also knew Chongyang’s deep root; they mutually revered each other. He Zhongli saw Changzhen and others and said: "You are all of high root and great capacity, your merits and conduct complete; why fear not becoming celestial immortals?" The four stayed in the temple. The next day, He Zhongli transcended and appeared visibly. The prefecture people took his body and lacquered and gilded it. Sick persons burned incense and prayed; none failed to respond to the prayers.  

In that summer, in the era of the Song, the emperor practiced archery and horsemanship in the palace. In the summer of the year Yichou, an arrow’s string broke and injured his eye. Chongyang, hearing this, sighed: "Alas! The wise and sagacious ruler — his aspiration will be extinguished." Chongyang led three disciples and returned to Shandong. The narrative will not further describe this.  

Now concerning Shandong Laizhou Prefecture, Yexian Military Official Manor, there was an old gentleman named Liu Jiacheng, a successful candidate in the literary examinations, now serving as prefect of Guide Prefecture. He had a wife surnamed Zhang, and a son whom they named Dacai. In the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Jin Xizong (the eighteenth year of Shaoxing of Song Gaozong), on the twentieth day of the seventh month in the year Mao, Zhang dreamed of red clouds covering her body; upon waking she felt pain in her belly and gave birth to a son named Dade. At five years old, Madam Zhang died; the old master Liu remarried a lady surnamed Liu, by whom he had another son named Dayong. Only Dade in his youth loved the Way, was intelligent and sagacious, unmarried and not extravagant, and delighted in reading Daoist scriptures. At fourteen years, his father fell ill and died; he returned to Yexian, daily revering the elixir scriptures. By twenty-two he abandoned home to seek the Way, carrying one hundred taels of silver, traveling far and wide to seek teachers.  

For five years abroad, at twenty-seven years he roamed Wu and Yue, returning to Yangzhou. One day in an eatery, he saw four Daoist priests passing on the street. Among them was an old man tall and large in stature, of imposing and peerless bearing; his eyes were bright and radiant. The other three were also clear-spirited and solemn in countenance, with the bearing of transcendents and immortal mien. Thinking: "In five years abroad I have never met such persons; these are men of the Way. I will advance to inquire their origins and destinations, and I will worship them as masters." He hastened to catch up. Upon entering the city he bowed deeply and said: "I pray the masters to enter the teahouse, that I may form a bond with you." Chongyang saw that this man had some immortal bone and could not but estimate him. He said to Changzhen and others: "This honored elder wishes to form a bond with us; very well, let us form a bond."  

The five entered the teahouse together. Chongyang took the head seat, the others sat accordingly. Dade asked: "Pray tell, honored master, whence is your immortal homeland? Your surname and dharma name?" Chongyang replied: "I, a humble Daoist, am a layman from Xianyang in Shaanxi, surname Wang, styled Zhiming, Daoist name Chongyang." He pointed to Tan, Hao, and Qiu: "These three are all from Shandong, and are my disciples. May I ask your honorable abode and family name?" Dade said: "My family dwells in Shandong, Yexian of Laizhou Prefecture; surname Liu, styled Dade. My late father once served as prefect of Guide. Alas, my father passed away; I have a younger brother. Seeing the swift passage of time and the vanity of worldly affairs, I have abandoned home to seek the Way. In these years abroad I have visited many masters, none of whom were true teachers. Today I have found the master, of noble conduct and appearance transcending life — surely a man of the Way. I desire to join under the master’s gate; I beg the master to show great compassion, to save your disciple; I will never forget the master’s grace all my life." Chongyang said: "You are a scion of a noble family; how can you endure the hardships of monastic life?" Dade said: "I wish to seek the Golden Elixir Way; even if it means suffering to death, my heart is willing. I have studied ancient true immortals who diligently cultivate the great Way; who does not endure hardship and apply effort to attain the supreme wondrous Way, escaping the cage?"  

Chongyang said: "Since you voluntarily wish to endure hardship and cultivate, you may follow me to Ninghai in Dengzhou for a journey." Dade seeing the master’s consent, kowtowed several times, and then turned to bow to the senior brothers. After returning their salutations, he went to buy some vegetarian snacks to offer. Chongyang said: "Your master has long abstained from cooked food." Hearing this Dade showed still greater respect, then went to buy fruits and the like, saying to the master, "Please wait a moment while I fetch my travel sack from the eatery, and then I will accompany you." Dade parted from the master and left the city; in a moment he brought his travel sack, and the five set out together. The narrative will not further describe this.  

Now it is told that in Wendeng County of Dengzhou Prefecture there was a virtuous man named Wang Xiaoxian. He lost his father in youth; his mother, surnamed Tian, practiced long fasting and pure vegetarianism, delighting in reciting immortal scriptures. Master Xiaoxian was born in the second year of Tianhui, the Wuwu year, on the sixteenth day of the third month at the hour of Yin (3-5 AM). He was born with heavenly form and jade-like bones, intelligent beyond others in childhood. He followed his mother’s vegetarian diet and disliked luxury. His family had an elder brother named Xiaoqian who managed the household affairs entirely. At first, Xiaoxian and his mother entered side paths; after long cultivation with no success, at the age of thirty-three his mother commanded him to go abroad to seek a clear master, and only then could he cultivate the great Way. If he remained trapped in side paths until old age, it would be of no benefit. Thus Xiaoxian bade farewell to his mother and brother and went abroad seeking the supreme Way.  
At first he came to Bianjing in Henan and took refuge with a lay practitioner, who was also of a side path. Then he went to Caoxian to visit a monk, but it was empty Chan sitting skill. Next he went south to visit a Daoist, also practicing taking in clouds and qi. Over three years he visited many masters, all not the true Way.  

Turning to Dengzhou, he heard that within Quanzhen Monastery dwelt hundreds of Daoists, with pure and strict rules, solemn observances, and a venerable method; among them an old Daoist from Shaanxi, surname Wang, Daoist name Chongyang, who knew the future and did not eat fire grains, whose name was spread across nations. Xiaoxian thought: "Searching afar is not as good as searching near; it must be true. I obey my mother’s command to seek the master and Dao. In these years abroad I have sought many masters, all not the true Way, fortunate that I could discern right and wrong and not be deceived by side paths. Who knew such a noble man was in my own prefecture?" He hastened to Ninghai. Within two days he came early to Quanzhen Monastery, where he saw a fine and grand temple, exactly as:

Palaces towering where sparrows come and go;  
No filth passes between beams where dragons and snakes run.  
Wayfarers come and go like celestial beings;  
It is called Quanzhen, its characters not amiss.

If you desire to know how Wang Xiaoxian’s later affairs proceed, listen to the next chapter unfold.
