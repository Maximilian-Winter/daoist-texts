# Chapter Ten: Expounding the Profound Teaching at the Assembly of the Seven Golden Lotuses; Raising the Ancestral Wind’s Banner, the Six Immortals Bear the Funeral

A Poem says:

Assembled the Golden Lotuses return to their native land,  
Squarely receiving and guiding the worthy and good.  
The teaching spreads o’er earth, revered through a thousand autumns,  
Its merit shines on the cinnabar heavens, enduring through ten thousand ages.  
Abandoning the world, no more heeding its phantasms,  
Casting off dust, what care for the vulgar dust’s vastness?  
Complete and bright is the original nature, the true thusness of reality,  
Sitting in transformation, establishing death, the True Dharma King.

Now it is told that those two disciples of the teaching, when the wind had ceased, rose and said: “This mad woman is possessed of diabolical arts. Henceforth we dare not be tainted by her.” Both, embracing their grief, returned. This matter is not set forth further.

In the spring of the year jiyou, the Jin sovereign Yong passed away, and the Crown Prince Jing ascended, styled Zhangzong. Since the passing of the Song Emperor Gaozong, the Emperor had wished to abdicate and conclude his mourning; now he retired to the Palace of Chonghua. The Crown Prince Zhun succeeded as Emperor Guangzong, honoring the former Emperor as the Longevity Emperor, and established Li Daozhi’s daughter as Empress.

In the year gengxu, the era was changed to Shaoxi, while Jin changed its era to Mingchang. Emperor Guangzong fell ill; affairs of state were decided by the Empress, and the Emperor ceased attending court at Chonghua Palace.

Now Wang Chongyang, having gathered Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun, had reached the full number of seven Golden Lotuses. Suddenly he summoned the disciples, saying: “Our ancient Patriarch once gave me a verse, saying that men shall be born in an age of loyalty and filial piety. Now the Sovereign does not follow the way of filial piety; I will proceed to meet my appointment at Pengying.” He then imparted the way of the Golden Elixir to Tan Changzhen, Wang Chuyi, Liu Changsheng, Hao Taigu, and others, and addressed Danyang: “My disciples, numbering over a thousand men and women, have received my way, but only a few dozens; only Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun have attained the Way. Each of you has some attainment, but Qiu Chujī alone has not spoken a word. This man’s roots are deep and firm; in time he will become a great vessel; we all cannot match him; therefore I devote myself to cultivating him. After my passing, you must transmit the secrets of the Elixir to him; then I shall have no further care.” The disciples said: “We beseech our Master to abide long in the world, and universally save the ignorant and foolish, that all may reach the shore of the Way and leave the sea of confusion.” Chongyang said: “The decree of Heaven is fixed; it cannot be forcibly opposed. Since Danyang entered the Way, though his family is wealthy, he has established temples, received masters and friends, and expended more than half his estate; his merit is enough to lead the Golden Lotus.” Then he addressed Qiu Chujī: “You have cast yourself under my teaching for more than twenty years, suffering many trials; yet not a word of the Way’s method have you spoken. After my passing, you must seek the profound secret from Ma Danyang; then, by accumulating merit and practice, the Great Way may be completed.” He then summoned a carpenter, ordering the making of a wooden shrine, externally secured with a shutter, so that four men might bear it; it was hastily made, prepared for use. After giving these instructions, he sent each to return to the Elixir chamber.

That night, Chongyang suddenly changed his form; his whole body was covered with malignant sores, and he cried out without ceasing. Chujī, Danyang, and the others, hearing their Master’s wild cries, hastened into the Elixir chamber and asked: “Master, why is this so?” Chongyang said: “Suddenly my body is restless and burning; these sores break out all over me, with unbearable pain.” The disciples saw their Master in deep suffering, and each lamented bitterly. Outside, the people debated; some said: “The Master is a great celestial of the Luo Heaven; why this strange transformation? Perhaps it is to test our resolve; it is not yet to be understood.” Others said: “The Master has no true inner skill; his external appearance is a mere show, a vain reputation; hence this ailment.” The opinions differed. Only Danyang understood, thinking: “Our Master desires to ascend to immortality, changing his form thus, to test the disciples.” Only Chujī and Chuyi served him with constant diligence day and night. After several days, the pustules burst and rotted, emitting an intolerable stench. Some lacked resolve and, seeing Chongyang thus, each went their own way.

It was in the first year of Shaoxi under Song Emperor Guangzong, which was also the first year of Mingchang under Jin Emperor Zhangzong, the year gengxu, on the night of the full moon in early spring; at age seventy-nine, the true man Chongyang prepared to return to the True. He summoned his disciples and gave orders: “At midday today I shall depart from this world; you must bear my shrine to Guānxi and there, at the place where the cords break, bury me on the spot.” The disciples were fearful and begged for departing words. Chongyang proclaimed:

The earth’s breath, the son Chongyang,  
Strongly calling the king who harms the wind.  
Coming with sun and moon,  
Departing, leaving west and east to their course.  
Companions are clouds and moon,  
Neighbours the void and emptiness.  
One spirit, true nature abides,  
Not following the world’s common paths.

The disciples hastily took brush and ink to record it. Chongyang then chanted a poem:

Since first receiving the mandate and descending to the mortal,  
A footprint in dust and ashes to be planted and born.  
How oft the immortal’s breath urges dream’s awakening,  
Several fish drums call the heart back.  
The triads thrice completed form the divine embryo,  
The ninety-nine labours achieved open the eye of the Way.  
The seven Golden Lotuses are now assembled,  
Only the cloud road remains to Penglai.

When the chant was complete, he suddenly returned to the True. There appeared white cranes and blue phoenixes, an immortal retinue, rising slowly to the azure firmament. All people near and far gazed and cried out in salutation; none but knew that the true man Chongyang ascended to Heaven.

Meanwhile, Danyang and the others, seeing their Master return to the True, each bowed, wept, and knelt to send him off. They cleansed their Master’s body, changed his garments, and placed him into the shrine, sealing it with the shutter and affixing the sealing strips. Danyang said: “The Master’s last words are known to all. After his ascension, his physical body must be sent to Shaanxi. Whoever is willing to bear it forward must come forth and declare.” Only Qiu Chujī, Hao Taigu, Tan Chuduan, Liu Chuxuan, Wang Chuyi, and others came forward, answering: “We are willing to bear it.” Danyang nodded: “Among us brothers there are over a thousand, but only these true ones: Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun. I am a fellow Wayfarer; over these decades I have laboured much. Now seeing it clearly, there are but five. With the six of us we may bear it to Shaanxi. Let us fix a date, raise the shrine, and set forth.”

Danyang left some trusted companions to watch the temple. He wished to hire some workers to help bear the shrine, but all said the journey was too far, better for the elder brothers to bear it themselves. Danyang agreed: “To endure the utmost hardship is to become superior among men. The road is long; we can only bring one hundred taels of silver, and when spent, beg alms on the way.” All agreed, arranged a vegetarian meal, performed the rites, then set out.

At first, others bore the shrine for them. After five li, only forty or fifty remained. After ten more, they parted company, leaving only the six. Suddenly the shrine emitted a foul stench, but the six united their hearts, showing no disgust. They travelled by day and rested by night; having left the domain of Dengzhou, suddenly the incense in the shrine shifted, and the shrine became light, as if empty. Crossing Henan, their money was nearly spent. When they reached the space between Shan Prefecture and Lingbao Township, many provided vegetarian meals. The six ate and replenished their funds. One said: “I do not sell food here; it is only because an old Taoist ahead asked us for alms, so you need not pay.” Danyang and others declined and resumed their journey.

The six were puzzled but unaware. Danyang said: “Could it be that our Master is ahead, gathering alms?” All believed this. On the road, whenever they reached places without food shops, and felt hunger, there were prepared meals.

Passing Tong Pass, Chujī said: “On our journey, whenever hunger came, there was alms food - pancakes, pies, noodles, buns. Surely Master is ahead gathering alms. I will hurry and catch up, to see clearly.” Changzhen and others said: “A good plan!” So Fuyang hastened ahead to the village.

Meanwhile, the true man Chongyang, astride a white crane in the air, saw that from Tong Pass to Huayin food shops were sparse. Fearing his disciples’ hunger, he descended and gathered alms food in the village to nourish them. While there, Chujī hurriedly arrived; unable to avoid him, was seen. Chujī knelt and said: “Disciples have discussed behind, knowing it is Master who gathers alms ahead. Today, seeing it is so, we beg your mercy and salvation.” The men and women of the village witnessed this, and Chongyang could not withdraw, so said to Chujī: “You wicked obstructer, this day you have disclosed Heaven’s secret; your guilt is not slight. Though you have true heart to cultivate the Way, you shall not escape the retribution of the Great Devil.” He then pointed to the air: “There come Danyang and the others.” The crowd looked up; Chongyang swept his sleeve and departed, dissolving into a clear wind, without shadow or trace. Suddenly the old Taoist was gone; all were astounded. Chujī knelt on the ground, seeing his Master vanish as wind, and wept, bowing deeply several times; then he left the village. The elder brothers had already arrived.

Meanwhile, Danyang and the others saw Fuyang entering the village in haste; the five also hurried to bear the shrine, arriving at the village entrance, and seeing Fuyang weeping, asked: “Did you see the Master?” Fuyang told the story of the Master’s alms gathering, but the Master had said that though he had true heart to cultivate, he could not escape the Great Devil, and departed as the wind. “What sort of Great Devil can this be?” he wondered. Liu Changsheng looked at Fuyang and said: “No wonder the Master said you cannot escape the Great Devil. Even by your appearance, I see two lines on your face near the mouth, called the ‘Soaring Serpent Locks the Mouth’; you are doomed to starve.” Fuyang said: “Brother Liu, can you really see destiny?” Changsheng: “In youth I liked physiognomy; though not fully skilled, I know some. Wife, wealth, children, and rank are certain; life span and fortune differ not. Especially Qiu’s face is bright; how could it be unknown?” Fuyang asked: “Is there any remedy for a ‘Soaring Serpent Locks the Mouth’?” Changsheng: “What remedy? The Emperor Wu of Liang had this sign and later starved to death in Taicheng. He was a sovereign; how could we common men escape?” Hearing this, Fuyang sighed: “In youth I loved the Way; at sixteen I left home; at nineteen met the Master. Over twenty years I suffered many trials; thinking my root was shallow, I persevered with firm heart, serving the Master day and night. Yet I gained not a word of teaching. Now the Master has passed, and meeting him today again, I begged and lamented, but he said I cannot escape the Great Devil, then vanished like wind. Now hearing Brother Liu, that I shall starve, what profit is there in my present cultivation?” He broke down and wept bitterly.

Changzhen and others mourned at Fuyang’s words. Danyang said: “Brother Qiu need not grieve. Brother Liu’s physiognomy is somewhat superficial, only for common men’s lives. You and I are monks; it does not apply. I have heard the Master say your root is extraordinary. Though you now suffer trials, when your merit and deeds are fulfilled, we shall not equal you.” Thus comforted by Danyang, Fuyang ceased his tears. The brothers bore the shrine and resumed their journey. From then on, no food was offered; the brothers each had to gather alms to sustain themselves.

Passing Huazhou to the border of Lintong, they heard of a warm spring, whose water is naturally hot; somewhat warm in summer, even hotter in winter. The brothers rested and bathed there. Danyang said: “This place is the vein of Mount Li, containing sulphur, making the water hot; it is rare under Heaven. This water cures sores, scabies, and eczema; also cools skin heat, dispels filth and miasma. In the future, I shall gather alms here in Qinchuan to nurture the Way, often bathing in this spring.”

After bathing, they resumed bearing the shrine, passed Chang’an, and arrived twenty li west of E County. Suddenly all the cords broke. Danyang said: “The Master’s last words were to cross Guānxi, and where the cords break, there bury him. Now we have come here, and the cords break. The burial place has arrived. I wonder whose land this is?” About to inquire, they saw a passerby. Asking, he replied: “Here are mostly the surnames Liu and Jiang; this place is called Liu-Jiang Village. This land belongs to Liu Yuanwai.” Hearing this, Danyang and Changzhen went to Liu Yuanwai’s house.

Liu Yuanwai was at home, holding his grandson at play. Danyang and Changzhen entered; seeing the old man with child, they bowed and said: “May we ask if this is the house of Liu Yuanwai?” The elder hurriedly set down the grandson and replied with courtesy: “This is my humble home. What brings you two masters here?” Danyang said: “We bear our Master’s spirit shrine here. Before the Master departed, he said to bear his shrine to the place where the cords break, and bury him there. Now we have come here, and the cords have broken. The place belongs to your estate. We wish to seek alms here to bury our Master and implore your great kindness.” The elder said: “From your accents you are not from these parts. Why bring the Master here to be buried?” Danyang said: “To speak plainly, we are natives of Shandong. Our Master was from Dawei Village in Xianyang County, surname Wang, name Jia, courtesy name Zhiming, Taoist name Chongyang. We bear his last words and bring his remains here for burial.” The elder said: “Your Master, might he be the one who dwelt in the earth’s cave for twelve years thirty years ago, the living immortal called Wang Chongyang?” Danyang said: “He is my late Master.”

Liu Yuanwai laughed heartily: “Do not speak nonsense! That Chongyang Zhenren is a great Luo Heavenly Immortal; how could he have died? He dwelt in the cave for twelve years, neither eating rice nor drinking water, yet never died. You say he died; I do not believe it. The Way says: When the Great Way is perfected, one refines the adamantine body, called the Golden Immortal. If your Master is truly Chongyang Zhenren, his body must be imperishable. You may open the shrine and see for yourselves. I myself have met the true man several times, and know him well.” Danyang said to Changzhen: “We bore the shrine across Henan; it seemed empty. Now hearing the elder’s words, let us open the shrine and see if it accords with my thought. Please, Master Liu, come open the shutter and see clearly.” Liu Yuanwai joyfully went with Danyang to the shrine.

Danyang related Liu’s words to the crowd; all rejoiced and said: “This is reasonable.” They opened the shutter and looked inside; it was an empty shrine, save for garments, hats, and socks. The people were both astonished and pleased; they restored the garments and placed them back in the shrine, closed the shutter, and said to Liu Yuanwai: “Since our Master has transformed, we shall bury this shrine here, to mark our Master’s affection.” Liu Yuanwai said: “So it seems indeed the immortal trace of Chongyang Zhenren. Let us bury him here, so we also may partake of immortal blessings. Please, Masters, come to my house for a meal, while I call workers to bury the immortal shrine of your Master.” All hastened to thank him.

Liu Yuanwai and the company went to his home; he called the kitchen to prepare a vegetarian meal. Workers were sent to dig the earth, and a vegetarian banquet was arranged before the shrine. Presently the feast was ready; Danyang and the others went with the workers to bury the shrine, kowtowing several times, offering money, then returned to Liu’s house. After the meal, Danyang and company expressed thanks; Liu Yuanwai saw them out at the great gate. The six took leave and departed. Truly it was:

Using this mortal body to refine the Dharma body,  
When merit is complete, the original truth appears.  
In empty space the primal spirit manifests,  
Not a thing apart from the worldly realm.

If you would know what became of the six after, listen to the next chapter unfold.
