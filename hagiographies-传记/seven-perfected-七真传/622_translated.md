# Chapter Twenty-Three: Master Qiu Changchun Ascends to Perfection in the White Cloud Hall; Pure Yangzi Dwells in the Azure Mist Cave

A verse says:

The origin of my teaching the Way is this: to avoid idle wandering, to forget the reckoning of spring and autumn.  
Swiftly boil and refine, sever desire and cut off passion; beside flowers and following willows, silently nurture and diligently cultivate.  
Gather the Three Treasures, preserve the non-being and guard the being; capture the six thieves, the laws and decrees strictly hold.  
Do not be detained nor linger; all day long without rest.  
Forget not, aid not; why joy or why grief? (Right tune: “Breaking the Cassia”)

Now it is related that Master Qiu the Perfected, about to impart the precepts and laws to Zhao Daojing, said: “These precepts and laws are for those with a high resolve; in movement and stillness, in speech and silence, in all things they abide in the Way; in going, standing, sitting, and lying down, they naturally accord with the rule. There is no precept to be precepted, no statute to be statuted; why need precepts at all? For those of middling resolve, they rely upon precepts to restrain themselves; with dignity and bearing they teach and admonish one another outwardly, and with precepts and statutes they uphold great aspirations inwardly, so that within and without they dare not act whimsically. At first it is by effort and constraint; by habitual practice it becomes natural. From precept arises steadiness; from steadiness arises wisdom. With wisdom flourishing, passion and desire are purified away, the foundation of the elixir is built; movement and stillness accord with rule, and the Way is not lost; the immortal grade is established. What is called precept is to stop evil and cultivate good, to cause blessings and eternal life; a great principle which later generations must practice. I have five verses of the Market of the Chain Sea to entrust to you.” The verses are:

To respond to Heaven with sincerity, not with ornate words; the affairs of men’s world are but confusion and tumult.  
Since the Yuanfeng responded to the spiritual call, a hundred years and different dynasties have heard nothing similar.  
The protector of Shandong’s heart loves the Way; passing by Penglai, he inquires after the medicinal herbs.  
Deeply hoping in a trance to commune with immortal spirits, he sees not the auspicious palm embraced in his bosom.  
At that time the great sea’s wind and waves cease; ten thousand li encompass the sky, suffusing the heaven’s blue.  
At the horizon harmonious vapors rise as purple smoke; beneath the sea mountains loom like blue walls.  
Layered cities and strange trees appear at the forefront; armoured horses and divine soldiers soon change.  
Empty banners and canopies arise from mountain peaks; precious pavilions and jade towers float upon the water’s surface.  
The three heavens seem like Penglai Palace, moving themselves east of the sea beyond the Three Mountains.  
The crane’s carriage floats gently near the western shore, coming to a time of clarity to stir the Way’s wind.

Now Zhao Xu Jing received the precepts and laws, and bowed to thank his master. Master Qiu further said to all: “Now in my school there are some who expound the Way and discourse on virtue, some who cultivate themselves and refine their nature, some who practise功 to aid the world, some who bear hardships to accumulate功; within the Way’s gate, all affairs, both internal and external, are included. I depart with no regrets.”

On the seventh day of the seventh month, the assembly requested the master to ascend the hall. Master Qiu said: “I shall ascend the hall on the ninth day.” The disciples entreated: “Please remain in the world several more years. We, the multitude, receive your shelter and protection, and multiply our brilliance.” Master Qiu replied: “I am eighty years old. My elder brothers have all already attained the Way; await me to go with them to respond to the summons, to meet the count of the seven golden lotuses; it cannot be opposed. If you have true resolve, there will be a time for reunion hereafter. Those who turn their backs on my Way shall never see me again.” When he had spoken, he gathered his spirit and sat calm, closing his mouth to speak no more. At noon on the ninth day, having taken his meal, he ascended the hall; a hymn was left:

Life and death, morning and evening, all matters alike;  
Illusory bubbles rise and fall, water ever flowing idle.  
Where faint light breaks forth, leaps the black rabbit;  
When the primal measure opens, it takes in sea and mountain.  
Waving eight arms as near as hand’s breadth,  
Blowing and puffing myriad things as if mechanism.  
Wild words, fallen pen form dust and dirt;  
Entrusted to the thoughtless ears of men today.

Then he sat in the Hall of Precious Light, to return to truth. At that moment, a cloud crane flew in the void; a white rainbow pierced the auspicious forest; near and far the people were amazed and terrified, their ten thousand eyes all beheld. An unusual fragrance lingered for several days without dispersing. The master’s former form was very humble, but upon fruition of the Way he transformed to the righteous appearance of celestial beings. The assembly of disciples and worthy ones gathered in great power; people of the Way and of the world from all directions hastened; those attending the funeral numbered tens of thousands, mourning as if they had lost a parent.

The master dwelt in the world eighty years; his disciples laid his corporeal body in burial at the White Cloud Temple, seating him in a jar. The master’s works, such as the “Panxi Mingdao Collection” and “Journey to the West,” circulated in the world; further, the sect’s forty-character lineage was handed down, called the Dragon Gate Sect:

Dao and virtue penetrate the mysterious and tranquil;  
The true and constant guards the Supreme Clarity.  
One yang returns to origin;  
Teaching united, forever round and bright.  
Ultimate principle is sincerity and faith;  
Exalted heirs carry on the flourishing law.  
The world’s glory shall be fostered;  
In subtlety is growth and tranquility.

Not long after Master Qiu’s burial, someone saw him in Fangshan, in his usual robes and cap. The village of Chu proclaimed the spiritual response and silent protection of Qiu Changchun; Emperor Yuan Taizong honoured him with the title “Great Perfected Master, Preacher of the Way of Changchun,” and ordered a statue to be erected at his tomb; incense smoke rose unceasingly for generations. Every year on the nineteenth day of the first month, the day of his sacred birth, the incense grew ever more fervent. Later generations called this the “Gathering of Yanjiu,” which lasted twelve days. Annual imperial sacrifices were held in spring and autumn to repay his merit. Master Qiu had countless disciples, among whom eighteen received his true transmission; the foremost were Yin Qinghe, Zhao Xu Jing, Wang Zhiming, and Li Zhen Duo. This is idle talk and will not be further related.

Now it is said that Li Zhen Duo, having obtained the secret instructions at Dragon Gate Cave, later met the goddess Magu, who further bestowed wondrous teachings. He entered Mount Huo and perfected his true fruit, his six roots without leak; he styled himself “The Leakless One.” At forty-eight years of age, he attained the transcendence of rebirth and spirit transformation, then came forth from the mountain to accumulate功. Upon learning of the master’s return to truth, he came to Yanjing to attend the funeral; none recognized him but Zhao Xu Jing, who, seeing him about twenty years of age, knew his Way was complete and grew more reverent. The assembly asked Brother Zhao: “Who is this female Daoist friend? She appears so young; how did you come to know her?” Xu Jing said: “This is senior brother Li, the foremost disciple of the master. Having obtained the master’s elixir instructions at Dragon Gate, they parted and met no more for decades; he has changed little in appearance, his great Way is perfected.”  
Hearing this, all came to pay respects, and Li Leakless returned salutations. Xu Jing asked: “Brother Li, where have you practised the Way these many decades? How came you to advance so swiftly? We have not matched you.” Li Leakless answered: “After parting from you at Dragon Gate Cave, I went to cultivate in the east, wandered the Magu Mountains and Danxia Caves, met the immortal goddess Magu who bestowed elixir and teachings. Then I cultivated at Mount Huo, somewhat attaining the arts of longevity and spiritual communion, but not yet a great Way; I cannot compare with the elder immortal brothers of high virtue and fame, who shall lead the mystery’s gate and be the compassionate ferry to save the world. How can this small art be likened? Now I wish to travel south to Wu and Yue; we shall meet again another time.” The assembly wished to detain him but could not; they sent him out the mountain gate and saw him float away.

The assembly returned to the hall and held counsel: “Our master has now transcended, the funeral is complete, and the hall has no lord. Only Brother Zhao, whose Way and virtue are lofty, can ascend the chief seat.” Xu Jing declined: “Now the Way folk number hundreds; among them many have virtue and talent; another election should be made. I am but weak in virtue, deep in sin, with scant talent and learning; how can I shoulder this great matter?” All said: “This office is none but yours, Brother Zhao. Moreover, the master once imparted precepts to you; it is fitting you should ascend the chief seat.” Immediately they summoned the heads of the halls to burn incense and hold candles; the crowd pulled and tugged, ascending the hall to take incense, ringing bells and beating drums. After all had worshipped their respective halls, they were led into the abbot’s chamber. The kitchen was ordered to prepare offerings, the new abbot was welcomed to the seat, and all Way folk and laymen came to pay respects and congratulations. The next day, officials, gentry, townsfolk, military and civilians all gathered to offer felicitations; the celebrations continued for over ten days.

Now Zhao Xu Jing, having ascended the chief seat, followed the master’s rules and regulations; with dignity and teaching mutually reinforcing, and by the decree of Master Changchun, the incense grew flourishing and the temple prospered. Master Changchun’s corporeal body seated in the jar was tended by later generations; when the jar broke the body was found incorrupt, visage like living, clothes torn revealing flesh, skin like jade colour, fingers and toenails growing several feet. Thus was known the perfected spirit ascended above, leaving form to dwell in the world; form and spirit both wondrous, harmonizing with the Way and truth. This is later matter and will not be related.

Now Master Qiu’s disciples dispersed to various places, presiding over the propagation of the Way, expounding wondrous methods, accumulating great功. All the branches of the ancestral Qiu and the Seven Perfected Sects spread teachings everywhere; at times monasteries were opened numbering seventy-two in all, greatly extending the school’s tradition. Truly:

The world transformed into the immortal realm,  
The worldly customs changed into the Way’s wind.

At that time Master Lü wandered in Lin’an, converting Huang Deyuan and Zhao Xiaoxian. Huang Deyuan was a man from Yue Commandery, quick-witted in youth, growing to admire the Way; he abandoned home to seek the Way. He visited famous mountains, striving to penetrate the mystery for over ten years, gradually gaining some attainment. Later he dwelt in seclusion at Qingxia Cave on Wu Mountain in Lin’an, where in front was a banana pond of serene and quiet scene; Deyuan dwelt there, closing his door to quietly nurture himself. Later a man from Chu, Zhao Xiaoxian, also came to dwell there, living by the pond, secretly cultivating with Deyuan, companions in purity and quietude. When Master Lü came here, he knew the two had long immortal roots and desired to convert them. Unexpectedly the two went elsewhere, lingering instead in Tianqing Temple. At that time, before the abbot’s chamber, banana flowers bloomed; Master Lü left a poem upon the banana leaf:

At midnight on Jun Mountain the moon plays and returns,  
West neighbour’s little garden where the green lotus blooms.  
Heaven’s wind and fragrant mist, azure flowers chill,  
From the register of names and causes I ask your coming.

After inscribing the poem, Master Lü departed. Several days later he came again but did not meet them; leaving another poem:

White snow and red lead stand as sacred embryo,  
Golden flower bud about to fully open.  
Good to go with you to the isle of Ying,  
Clouds in the blue sky, cranes not yet returned.

Huang and Zhao then returned to the cave to roam and admire; seeing the two poems on banana leaf, they knew them to be immortal calligraphy, and regretted missing the meeting. Several years later a stranger suddenly came, appearing graceful and speaking with uncommon words. Huang and Zhao received him with earnest hospitality and lowly entreaty. The guest bestowed two poems:

To awaken the heart is easy, but to rest the heart is hard;  
When resting, the source of the heart is everywhere at ease.  
The stars revolve and the sky nears dawn,  
White clouds still cover the green mountains.  
One day of leisure is one day immortal,  
Six spirits harmonized and naturally at peace.  
In the elixir field is treasure, cease seeking the Way;  
In the facing circumstance, no mind, do not question Zen.

Huang and Zhao read the poems, amazed, saying: “These two poems resemble those on the banana leaf years ago. Could this not be Master Dongbin the Immortal?” They hastened to bow and seek conversion. Master Lü then imparted these words:

Nurture Qi, forget words and guard;  
Lower the heart to non-action.  
Know the ancestor in movement and stillness;  
If no matter, to whom seek again?  
The true and constant must respond to things;  
Responding, do not be deluded.  
Not deluded, nature rests;  
Nature resting, Qi returns.  
Qi returning, elixir self-forms;  
Within the vessel matches Kan and Li.  
Yin and Yang generate return and repeat;  
Universal transformation in one thunderclap.  
White clouds ascend to the crown;  
Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.  
Drink the wine of longevity;  
Who knows the leisure of freedom?  
Sit and listen to the zither’s strings;  
Fully comprehend the mechanism of creation.  
All come in these twenty lines,  
Truly the ladder to the heavens.

Also composed were four quatrains:

To scoop the moon’s heart from the North Sea waves,  
First bind the clouds atop South Mountain’s ridge.  
If any understand this meaning,  
They may fly like birds to see the Primal Lord.  
Half a moon lights up the West River,  
A crow flies north to the North Sea’s head.  
Moon sets, crow flies and is lost;  
In the Palace of Broad Cold, a man rides a bull backward.  
The north gate of mystery is open all day,  
In the midst a single aperture, the mixed spirit stage.  
No connection, no lock, no guardian;  
Sun and moon come and go east and west.  
To gather herbs requires knowing the moon above;  
To cultivate requires knowing the gold in water.  
Moon without Geng Qi, gold without water;  
Even true lead is used in vain.

Pointing further to the mysterious elixir cultivation formulas, then taking leave. The two bowed him out; he vanished in a clearing wind, leaving no trace.

The two devoted themselves to cultivation, avoiding contact with external things, cultivating for over twenty years; their elixirs perfected. They carved the earlier hundred characters upon stone; later generations called it the Hundred-Character Stele. One day, on the rock above, cloud cranes circled; Zhao Xiaoxian bathed and changed clothes, bidding farewell to all: “The immortal master comes to escort me; I must go.” He sat down and spoke a verse:

Treading through Wu mountains and Yue waters,  
A lifetime’s floating hat and clear wind.  
Suddenly at the third watch the thunder rises,  
Fully breaking the void.

Then he closed his eyes and transformed. Later Huang Deyuan lived to one hundred sixty-four years, also shedding corpse and departing. This is later matter and will not be related.

In the year Jichou, the monk Kou Yan of Tingshao practiced sorcery and raised an army to plunder prefectures and counties; troops invaded Jianning. Song general Chen Xue and military inspector Liu Chun led forces to defeat him. Liu Chun was a descendant of Liu Bei, skilled from youth, who entered Mount Longhu and was taught by a strange man; now he used his arts to overcome Kou Yan. Thereafter the Buddhist order declined; temples were destroyed and monks suffered grievous harm. That winter, the Song Emperor Lizong established Lady Xie as Empress. She was from Tiantai; formerly one eye was covered, body dark; she practiced filial piety. At the selection, she fell ill with a rash; upon recovery, her skin peeled and was white as jade. She met a divine physician who removed the eye covering. Entering the palace with solemnity, the Empress Dowager esteemed her, thus she was established empress.

In the year Xinmao, Jin changed the era to Tianxing. The Mongols attacked Bian in the fifth month; a great plague struck Bianjing, many died. Tolui died in battle, the army retreated. The Mongol remnant sent envoys to Song, proposing to attack Jin, granting Henan lands to Song. Song therefore dispatched troops. Mongol Nayan’s brother Subutai led forces to join Song troops against Jin, besieging Bianjing.

In spring of Guisi, the Jin ruler fled to Caizhou. Subutai captured Jin’s empress and princess, heading north. The Way was difficult and bitter; Subutai planned to slaughter Bian’s people, but Chu Cai hurried to plead, gaining reprieve for the people, only executing the Wanyan clan. In September, armies again besieged Caizhou.

In spring of Jiawu, Jin changed era to Wuduanping. Jin ruler Weizong passed throne to son Chenglin. Song general Lingxia Meng Gong entered Cai and took the city; Shou Xu hanged himself. Chenglin died in battle; Zhang Tiangang was taken captive to Song; Jin fell.

The Song Emperor ordered the trial of Tiangang in the Dali court. Lin’an prefect Xue Qiong said: “How can you face me here?” Tiangang said: “What dynasty’s rise and fall is without such? Now Jin is gone; how are you two emperors better?” Xue Qiong reported his words; the Emperor summoned him: “Are you not afraid to die?” Tiangang said: “Only afraid of unfaithfulness; what fear is there? Let me die.” The Emperor spared him. Later he met Master Lü, who pitied his lonely loyalty, led him to Mount Siming, ordering him to take Master Ziqi as teacher; thereafter he attained the Way’s fruit. This is later matter.

Now Zhen Dexiu served as Song Deputy Prime Minister, serving less than ten years; he submitted several hundred thousand memorials, all concerning pressing affairs. He was the old Taoist of Zhongnan who had departed spirit but not returned, reborn by disciple’s burning of his body. Scholars called him Master of Western Mountain. At that time Emperor Song appointed Jia Fei’s younger brother Sidao as tax commissioner, proud in favour. There was a man from Nanfeng, Yuan Shengsheng, styled Qianli, possessing the law of thunder for execution; he traveled to Jiangxi, exterminating demons and suppressing evil, lodging at the Dai family in the city. One day he said to Dai: “After I die, burn my body.” Having said so, he died aged over one hundred. His corpse was burned; from the smoke appeared a golden banner saying, “Thunder and Lightning’s Second Judge Yuan Qianli,” ascending with the smoke. Truly:

Immortals descend to earth for a cause,  
Returning with no care for body beyond body.  
Unstained by fleeting fame and profit,  
Free and easy, delighted in true heaven.
