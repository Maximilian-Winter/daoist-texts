# Chapter Twenty-Four: The Primordial Fate Raises the Generals to Uphold the State — Imperial Edict Summons the Immortals to Receive Office

The Poem says:

== Inviting to roam the great earth through several springs and autumns,  
Urging men of the age to reform who yet will not.  
The mechanism of life and nature is worth defending;  
Within the circle of profit and fame, do not weave snares.  
A hundred years’ limited span of time hastens on;  
Suddenly, inconstancy comes and all affairs cease.  
Hasten to turn back and diligently refine;  
Together with you ascend the Isle of Phoenix and Qilin. ==

Now it is told of Sa Shoujian of the Western River, born in the year of Gengchen in the era of Yuanfu, on the twenty-third day of the ninth month. At his birth red clouds enveloped the chamber. In youth he was upright and keen. At first he studied medicine, but by error in the use of drugs caused death. Afterwards he abandoned home and sought the Way, travelling widely among famous mountains, where he met the Master Tieshi Zhenren who imparted wondrous teachings. Having accomplished the fruition of the Way, he styled himself Quanyangzi. He once held the register of penal affairs of the nine provinces, overseeing the merits and demerits of ghosts and spirits under Heaven, displaying great divine power. Passing by Xiangyin’s floating bridge, he saw men using boys and girls to sacrifice to temple gods. Sa Shoujian said, "These are lascivious spirits; their temples should be burned." Having spoken, thunder and fire flew into the sky, and the temple was instantly destroyed. Thereafter the Master Sa travelled extensively to succour and aid, accumulating merits numbering hundreds of billions over twelve years. Arriving at the bank of the Dragon Rising River, he washed his hands, holding water in his mouth, spitting and cleansing; suddenly he saw the image of a deity above the water. Sa Shoujian asked the deity who he was. The deity answered, "I am the Heavenly Lord of Fire Chariot, Spirit Official Wang of the former Heaven. For long I have waited at the Lingxiao Palace, receiving the jade edict and temple offerings from Xiangyin, to punish the evil deeds of this region. Since the Master burned my temple, I have followed for twelve years, awaiting offences to renew old enmities. Now that the Master’s功行 (meritorious deeds) are high, and he is appointed under the Heavenly Pivot, I wish to serve as a subordinate general to aid in command." Sa Shoujian made a covenant with him, expressing their mutual feeling.

Later arriving at Zhangzhou, one morning all generals appeared in form to attend him; the Heavenly Edict summoned him to the Heavenly Pivot. The Master Sa received the edict, appointed chief of the Heavenly Assembly, holder of the office of the One Origin Supreme True Lord. His banners, flags, and canopies were displayed; celestial boys conducted and guided him ascending to Heaven. Afterwards he was commanded that the Spirit Official Wang should protect the Daoist gate; all in the world with true will who cultivate the Way and perform功 (merits) shall have protection with them; should there be famine, tigers, wolves, ghosts, demons, wicked men, or all manner of weapons and fire, their bodies shall not be harmed. His command led three thousand generals of silver teeth and phoenix beak, and one million tiger-headed soldiers to guard and uphold the Profound Ancestry. No further record.

On the day Bing Shen, the Mongols under Kuo Duan broke Chengdu; the defenders of Wenzhou, Liu Rui and Zhao Ruxiang, held firm, but reinforcements did not arrive. Liu Rui gathered his family and drank poison to die. When the city fell, the bodies of Liu Rui and his two sons were taken away. Zhao Ruxiang was captured and killed. The Mongols then invaded Jiangling. Meng Gong repeatedly captured twenty-four forts. They then invaded Zhenzhou, where Qiu Yue defeated them.

On the day Ding You, the Song changed its era name to Jiaxi.

On the day Ji Hai, waters flooded the Gen Mountain Gate.

On the day Xin Chou, the Song changed its era name to Chunyou. At that time the Mongol ruler was fond of wine; Chu Cai admonished him and he decreed daily the intake of three measures. In the second month, the emperor fell seriously ill and his pulse ceased. Chu Cun said there were many wrongfully imprisoned criminals in the realm and it was fitting to pardon them in hopes of blessing. The emperor commanded a pardon proclamation, and his pulse returned. In the third month, Chu Cai calculated the Taiyi numbers and said the emperor should not go hunting. The emperor did not listen, going out for five days, and returned to die on the Way. At that time the Mongol clan Mazhen held power. Chu Cai, because his admonitions were ignored, died sorrowful and angry. He served as prime minister for twenty years, leaving only his qin and books.

On the day Jia Wu, the Mongols entered the two Huai regions. Lü Wende won a great victory over them, but they again invaded Shu, and Yu Jie defeated them. Since the death of Taizong, six empresses ruled for five years. Chu Cai died, law and order became confused, and discord arose within and without. That autumn, Guiyou established Dingzong, who was the eldest son of Taizong. That winter, news came that Song Meng Gong had died, and the Mongols divided their forces to attack Jiang and Huai.

On the day Ding Wei, the Song appointed Zhao Kui to command the Jiang and Huai troops to resist them.

On the day Ji You, the Song concubine Sun gave birth to a son, whom, because he did not weep but was dull, was named Min.

On the day Geng Xu, Jia Sidao was appointed to govern the two Huai regions, and Zhao Kui was dismissed. The Mongol ruler Dingzong died.

On the day Xin Hai, the eldest son of Tolui, Möngke, was established as Xianzong, and the younger brother Kublai was appointed to manage Mongol and Han affairs. Upon hearing that Yao Shu was a man of the Way, he summoned him; Yao humbly accepted instruction, then divided the forces to take Huai and Shu. The Song appointed Shi Tianze to manage Henan, and the army and people were in good order.

On the day Ren Zi, the era name was changed to Huili, and the prince Min was ennobled as Yi Wang.

On the day Gui Chou, the Song changed their era name to Baoyou. The emperor was anxious over Sichuan. It was said Yu Jie lost the hearts of the soldiers and officers, so the emperor replaced him with Yu Hui. Yu Jie was uneasy upon hearing this and suddenly died. Later men saw him on Qingcheng Mountain, sitting with a purple-bearded Daoist on a stone, saying, "I was troubled and anguished, when suddenly Master Yao appeared by order of Zhongli to awaken me here." The old man twice bowed and then disappeared. A report was sent to Yu’s household, and orders were given not to spread the tale.

On the day Jia Yin, an edict confiscated Yu Jie’s family property to reward the troops. Yu’s son Rushun was poor and could not repay debts; meeting the immortal Tang who gave him ginger, both turned into gold. Rushun sold it in the market; a merchant Hu bought tens of thousands, saying, "This gold is alchemical gold of Immortal Tang, able to repel fire and water, to prosper the harvest, and is called a supreme treasure by foreign lands." Rushun thereby repaid debts and established his estate. No further record.

Meanwhile, Yu Hui repeatedly suffered defeat in Shu and was recalled. Kublai recommended Xu Heng as the governor of Jingzhao, but he did not come. Hearing that Liu Bingzhong of Xingtai was a man of the Way, living reclusively on Wuan Mountain, Kublai summoned monk Haiyun and Liu Bingzhong together. Kublai saw their talents, recommending Bingzhong as prime minister, and thus opened Kaiping Prefecture. The Mongol ruler desired personally to attack the Song and ordered divination of the campaign. Bingzhong said, "The Song’s power is destined to perish, but the ruler’s going south is ill-omened."

On the day Ding Ji, the Song appointed Zhao Kui as Shaobao. Jia Sidao accused him of embezzlement of military funds; Kui was dismissed and died of illness.

On the day Ji Wei, the Song changed its era name to Kaiqing. The Mongol ruler, hearing of Zhao Kui’s death, led his troops to replace Shu, but died in camp. Kublai crossed the river; the Jiang and Huai prefectures all surrendered. The Song were greatly alarmed, appointing Wu Qian as Left Prime Minister and Sidao as Right Prime Minister. Sidao secretly sent envoys to request peace, and Kublai withdrew his army.

On the day Geng Shen, the Song changed its era name to Jingding. Kublai ascended the throne, establishing the era Zhongtong, as Yuan Shizu, founding the state of Da Yuan. Hearing that Song Piyun was a man of the Way, he was ennobled as Tongxuan Hongjiao Piyun Zhenren, in charge of Daoist affairs under Heaven. The monk Sima was made national preceptor, in charge of the Buddhist sect throughout the realm, and shared ceremonies with Song Piyun. Envoys were sent to Annan and Koryo, both of whom submitted. At that time, the Song dismissed Wu Qian from Xun Prefecture; Jia Sidao again sent poison to kill him. Wu Qian had once attained the Way from Peng Helin; at this time poisoned, he told his family, "I will die; tonight there will be wind and thunder, do not be alarmed." That night wind and thunder roared, and his corpse was not found.

In autumn of the year Jia Zi, a comet appeared in the willow constellation. Liu Bingzhong said to the emperor, "The Song ruler is about to die." The Yuan changed its era to Zhiyuan. Bingzhong was made Taibao. In the tenth month of winter, the Song emperor died; the crown prince Ji ascended as Duzong. On the day Yi Chou, the era was changed to Xianning. On the day Ding Mao, Queen Quan was made empress. On the day Ji Si, Lü Wende died of carbuncle on his back. In spring of the year Geng Wu, the assistant chancellor Jiang Wanli, seeing Xiangyang and Fancheng in peril, requested troops to assist. Sidao did not reply, and Jiang Wanli asked to leave. At that time, Mongol prime minister Lian Xixian managed affairs with moderation. Jia Sidao, unconcerned for court matters, sat daily at Geling, constructing pavilions, entertaining guests, and modeling his own image within. He built the Duobao Pavilion, storing treasures and antiques. He arranged the Yunshui Studio, where two Daoists were seated, drinking excessively; when servants dragged them forth, they bore sword and qin bags. Soon two Daoists came to pay respects, saying, "We hear the prime minister is at ease and values tolerance; why then resist us? We two are wandering old acquaintances, and so come to pay respects. We dare offer a poem:

The prime minister’s might and fortune are exceedingly cruel,  
The state is perilous, yet he himself is at ease.  
The cricket ceases its struggle at half leisure,  
The north wind blows thoroughly, cottonwood is cold."

The white-robed Daoist said, "Pampered by favour, he harms the good, causing half the realm to suffer foulness; he shall not escape the nether retribution, yet dares to be so arrogant! I am Wu Commander Zhou; this is Guannei Hou Ge." The yellow-robed Daoist said, "Fortune is spent and will fall into the tiger’s mouth; I only regret that my Sacred Mountain is defiled." They grasped hands and proudly left. Sidao asked the doctor, "Who are these chivalrous men?"

On the day Gui You, the Yuan took Fan and Xiang.

On the day Jia Xu, Jiang Wanli resigned as prime minister at Jiu Rao. That autumn, the Song emperor died. Sidao installed Duke Liang as Emperor Gong, aged four; Empress Dowager Xie governed in his stead. His elder brother Gang was made Prince Ji, younger brother Ang Prince Xin. At that time Liu Bingzhong dwelt at Nanping Jing She, dying without illness. The Yuan ruler grieved, ordering Boyan to invade southward, attacking Ezhou. The commander Zhang Shijie fought valiantly, repelling them. Boyan departed, besieging Ezhou and capturing Jing and Hu. The young Song emperor was frightened and fell ill. The physician Li Lizhi was summoned and the emperor recovered.

On the day Yi Hai, the Song changed era to Deyou. Master Sidao reached Wuhu requesting peace, but Boyan refused. The deputy magistrate Zhao Ang and his wife died together; Boyan ordered their burial. One night great wind and rain broke the grave and the corpse was lost. Jiang Wanli drowned while fleeing. Various Jiangnan prefectures either surrendered or fled. The commander Mi You died in battle. Zhang Shijie’s forces recaptured Rao Prefecture. Jiangdong prefectures all surrendered to the Yuan. Commander Meng Ji took Shashi; Sima Meng sought death. In the sixth month, an edict ordered Jia Sidao to settle in Kuaiji, with Zheng Huchen as overseer; at Zhangzhou Mianmian Monastery he was killed, fulfilling the sign of the former poem.

On the day Bing Zi, Tanzhou was captured; the judge Li Fu and his entire household remained loyal. The prefect of Hengzhou Gou burned himself and family. The Hunan army fell. Wen Tianxiang pleaded with Princes Ji and Xin to govern Min and Guang; the empress dowager consented, appointing Tianxiang Right Prime Minister to protect the two princes southward. Boyan’s soldiers reached Lin’an, collecting registers, sealing treasury, and detaining the empress dowager and Song emperor northward.

On the day Bing Zi, Tianxiang arrived at Wenzhou, escorting Prince Gang to open government at Fuzhou. That summer, Prince Gang ascended as Emperor Duanzong, changing the era to Jingyan, ennobling Jing as Prince Wei. The Yuan ruler deposed Emperor Liang as Duke Ying, soon made a monk; Empress Quan became a nun, residing jointly at Zhengzhi Temple.

The Yuan divided to take Min and Guang. Zhang Shijie escorted the emperor to sail, fleeing to Chaozhou. The Yuan ruler appointed Zhang Hongfan as marshal. On day Wu Yin, he led troops into Min and Guang.

In the fourth month of summer, Duanzong died at Gangzhou. The ministers wished to disperse. Lu Xiufu requested to enthrone Prince Wei, changing the era to Xiangxing, becoming Emperor Jing. Lu Xiufu was appointed Left Prime Minister, sharing government with Zhang Shijie; the emperor was moved to Yashan. There appeared great comets flowing south and small stars following, their sound like thunder. Tianxiang was made Shaobao and Duke Xinguo. At that time a great plague struck the central army; Tianxiang’s son Daosheng died; Fosheng was captured. In the sixth month Zhang Hongfan arrested Tianxiang, who firmly requested death. Shijie fought valiantly but the army was routed. Lu Xiufu carried Emperor Liang to the sea and died. The emperor raised a white pheasant, fighting and wailing, falling into the sea to accompany his master. Hongfan’s troops retreated; Shijie obtained the emperor’s corpse and buried him with Duanzong. The scattered forces gradually regrouped. Hearing that Prince Yi’s son was in Guang, they plotted to enthrone him, but suddenly a great hurricane arose. Shijie climbed the helm tower, burning incense and praying, "Does Heaven wish to destroy the Zhao clan?" The storm worsened; their boat capsized and they drowned. The generals abandoned their corpses on Xiangshan; the people all dispersed. The Song were destroyed; the Yuan unified the realm.

Yuan Shizu, recalling the achievements of his ancestors, esteemed the Dao and revered the immortals; now having established the Great Yuan, uniting the world, all depended on the protection of immortals and perfected ones. He issued the edict:

Lü Zong of Dongbin is conferred as Pure Yang, manifesting rectitude, warning and transforming, Faithful Guardian Emperor.

Liu Zong of Haichan is conferred as Haiyang, succeeding the Ninth Heaven to Support the Right Emperor.

Wang Zong of Chongyang is conferred as Chongyang, Broad Teaching, Promoting Mystery and Cultivating Virtue Emperor.

Zhang Zong of Ziyang is conferred as Ziyang, Lesser Office of Tiantai, Initiating the True Lord.

Shi Zong of Xinglin is conferred as Zixu, successive branch, Cherishing Righteousness, Embracing Benevolence, Verdant Mystery True Lord.

Xue Zong of Zixian is conferred as Zixian, manifesting Branch Yuqia, Awakening Enlightenment True Lord.

Chen Zong of Niran is conferred as Zini, Manifesting the Strange, Following the Light, Universal Salvation True Lord.

Bai Zong of Qiongguan is conferred as Ziqing, from the Palace Branch, Aiding Mystery and Supporting Origin True Lord.

Qiu Zong of Changchun is conferred as Changchun, Perfect Virtue, Quiet Transformation, Bright Response, Chief Teacher True Lord.

Hao Zong of Taigu is conferred as Taigu, Broad Peace, Penetrating Mystery, Wonderful Ultimate True Lord.

Sun Zong of Bu’er is conferred as Clear Quiet, Abyssal Truth, Profound Void, Harmonious Transformation Origin Lord.

Sa Zong of Xihe is conferred as Xihe, Delivering from Suffering, One Origin Supreme True Lord.

All these ancestors and perfected true lords are granted additional investitures, with treasures and widespread proclamation. It is further commanded throughout the realm: the Tianqing Temple is to be renamed Xuanmiao Temple; all palaces and temples are to be granted plaques and ordered built. The profound wind of the world is greatly stirred, and the Way’s transformation and practice flourish.

Now it is told of the Perfected Master of Longchun, who, having attained the Way, wandered at Fang Mountain, then at Wangwu Mountain, meeting Wang Yuyang, and together they came to the utmost true cave of Zhongnan to pay respects to their master. Chongyang rejoiced, saying, “Now your功行 is high, you need not go abroad to perform功; dwell here awaiting the edict to ascend. Await the gathering of all Daoist friends, so as to proceed together to Peng and Ying.”

Meanwhile Ma Danyang was performing功 in southern Min. Seeing the Song dynasty destroyed, he returned to the Mixed Origin, knowing that Longchun had long attained the Way, and wished to return to Zhongnan. At Xiangzhou he unexpectedly met Bu’er, inviting him to join in going to Zhongnan. Passing by Junshan of Dongting, they saw a wine shop enveloped in white clouds, knowing a superior immortal was present. The two immortals entered and saw Lü and Zhong two ancestors transformed as two wandering Daoist companions, drinking with a fellow Daoist clad in rags. The two immortals recognized them and advanced to pay respects. The three immortals feigned madness, laughing loudly and departing, leading Danyang and Bu’er to Zhongnan cave. Chongyang led his disciples to pay homage to the Patriarch. The next day, Tan and Liu immortals also arrived. Soon Hao Taigu brought Teng Gu into the cave, paying respects to the master and other immortals.

At that time the assembled immortals were discoursing on功业. Suddenly, cloud cranes circled in the air, celestial music sounded in chorus, clan banners were displayed, and from among the cloud chariots emerged an immortal officer, Master Xu Jingyang, who, by imperial command, descended to proclaim the edict:

On the path of man and Heaven, doing good is first;  
In the register of immortals,功行 is foremost.  
功 high and virtue broad, then the immortal register records the name;  
The Way complete and spirit perfect, then the Jade Capital enrolls.  
Master Wang once received the jade edict, descending to accumulate功; his mysterious功 is now manifest,  
Commanded that Zhengyang and Quanyang lead the disciples to go early to Lingxiao to receive office.  
The imperial command is issued; all should heed this.

The immortals all bowed. In a moment, each ascended cloud chariots, following the command to ascend Heaven. Banners and regalia, golden boys and jade maidens, pair by pair, guided upward to Lingxiao.

The two immortals Zhengyang and Quanyang led the immortals, first paying respect to the Four Great Kings and the two ranks of Heavenly Former Saints, immortal officers and clerks; next to the Four Emperor Lords and Four Heavenly Masters; then ascending the Palace of Brightness to worship the Supreme Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor, upon seeing them, rejoiced greatly, and transmitted the decree conferring Zhengyang as Upper Minister of the Golden Gate, Quanyang as Inner Minister of Jade Purity, Sa Shoujian as Inner Minister of Heavenly Pivot, Liu Haichan as Right Minister of Heavenly Mechanism, Zhang Boduan as East China Attendant Immortal, Wang Zhiming as Flying Rain Wondrous Transformation Assistant Supreme True Lord, Qiu Chuji as Heavenly Immortal Top Scholar, Sun Bu’er as Leader of Female Immortals and Supreme Immortal. The remaining immortals were appointed true lord offices, each to take residence in famous mountains, blessed lands, and grotto heavens, awaiting功 deeds to receive further rewards. The immortals accepted office and bowed in thanks, each making obeisance and withdrawing. They each turned their course of clouds, residing in grotto heavens and blessed lands; happily carefree, again accumulating功 to aid men. Truly it is:

==功 fulfilled, the Way complete, the day of true attainment,  
Receiving the edict, flying to the upper immortals’ realm.  
High on the Heavenly List, revered through all ages,  
The Golden Lotus History records are no vain tale.==

Postscript

The world’s censure of the Profound Ancestry is to say that cultivation of immortality and attainment of the Way are all groundless talk. Now viewing the "Golden Lotus Immortal History", dynasties, places, years and surnames are all clearly verifiable; is this not sufficient to be called authentic history? The traces and deeds of immortals recorded therein not only stress earnest cultivation, but especially the accumulation of功 and deeds, described in great detail. Only the subtleties and profound mysteries each reader must inwardly apprehend; these may be imparted in meaning but not by words. Although it is said that there are branches, in truth all derive from the same source. The Three Treasures and Five Elements are especially crucial. To speak of the Easy, the Great Way is originally ordinary, not in display of marvel or pride; to speak of the Difficult, it is like turning a stone up a mountain, the higher the more perilous, step by step stumbling, earlier efforts lost. If men truly do not neglect the easy and so endure, and do not fear the difficult and so stand firm, they may well converse on the Profound.

In the autumn of the year Wujia, the Fire Daoist received this History as a gift, charged to print and circulate it in the world. I received and read it, finding wondrous thoughts gushing forth, unceasing. It is indeed of no little merit to those of the yellow cap order. Herewith I offer pear and jujube as offerings to all awakened ones, as a ladder and guide for later scholars.

In the autumn month of the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, respectfully inscribed by Chang Baozi.
