# True Words of the Mind-Method

In the second year of Kangxi, in the year of the Guimao, on an auspicious day of the tenth month, Master Kunyang delivered the precepts at the Green Garden of Jinling. He spoke to Master Ningzhen, Shao Shoushan, and to Master Fuyao, Zhan Shouchun, saying: “From my tender years I have been devoted to the Way; I have discerned the unreality of fleeting life, the illusory realm and its instability; to escape the cycle of rebirth, I have early cultivated the supreme Way. Yet although Kongtong is near, Master Guangcheng has not permitted our meeting; although the Penglai Isles are not far, how can the body of an ordinary man attain them? It is essential to keep far from pollution, to sweep away all dust, to cleanse the heart and chest, to purify the faint aspirations and thoughts, to consume and wear away the habits of entanglement so that worldly notions become as ashes, to eliminate the body of desire and sever the roots of delusion. All conditions cease suddenly, and all proceed step by step from precepts and concentration; myriad thoughts return to emptiness, all are seen, layer by layer, from wisdom itself. When liberation is attained, tranquillity is secured; when vision is clear, endurance follows. Therefore raise the eyebrows, and with the hand draw the knife that cuts craving; loosen the steps, and mount directly to cross the world’s ferry. To turn over is to be freed from the wheel of rebirth; to change the mind is to transcend the net of entanglement. Though compassion does not perish, the ancients said, ‘Save thyself, and thereby save others’; let the vow of benevolence remain always, ‘I desire to save myself and thereby save them.’”

“I remember in former years seeking the Truth and searching for the Way, I once ascended Wangwu and met a bright master. From above I received the great grace of the Three Treasures, and heard the precious Dharma with my own ears; from below I relied on the strength of my own body, and practised austerely to cultivate myself. I took refuge in the supreme Dharma King, and practised the wondrous Way of the Great Vehicle. It was to be met with in a time of flourishing peace, tranquillity and happiness, a marvel scarce heard in myriads of kalpas, and rarely seen in a thousand lives. How dare I not expound the Three Treasures, and repay the fourfold kindness! I shall in part fulfil the slight wish, and humbly offer the light of my sincerity.”

“Therefore, not forgetting the fault of presumption, I have opened the altar to proclaim the precepts; avoiding neither laughter nor scorn, I unfold teachings and discourse on the scriptures. It is not for seeking fame by good deeds, but to repel error and dispel doubts. The heavenly laws do not admit of flowery words; the supreme Way consists only in straight speech. Carefully do I present the family tradition of the seventh generation of Longmen to the great assembly. Respectfully do I record the Green Garden’s earnest words, for the universal benefit of men and heavens. I dare not use empty words; why should I not speak plainly? Now I shall bestow upon you, precisely to lead the ignorant and bewildered, and to make manifest the true Dharma.”

“As for the instruments of the highest vehicle, and those discerning and lofty persons, this poor Daoist of the lower ranks is fortunate indeed, and desires to entreat your compassion to lead and instruct, that what I have heard may be verified—this is my humble wish.”

Having heard these instructions, the two disciples made obeisance and withdrew, standing in order from east to west.

Then disciple Shi Shouping of Guangling bowed his head and chanted:

“The Dharma has no origin, yet it arises from the mind; the mind is originally no-mind, thus the Dharma is empty. When the mind manifests, the Dharma King’s mind manifests; when the Dharma returns, the mind governs the Dharma’s emptiness. One must understand that the Law of concentration is not a perfect form; one must awaken that the common mind is the sacred mind. Mind is Dharma, Dharma is mind; mind is Law, Law is mind. The Law’s mind is liberation—this is the knower’s friend.”
