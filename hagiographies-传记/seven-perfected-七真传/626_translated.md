# The Threefold Refuge

The Three Treasures are the Way, the Scripture, and the Master. The Way is originally void and empty, without form and without name; without the Scripture it cannot be made manifest. The Way is within the Scripture, profound, subtle, and mysterious; without the Master one cannot obtain its principle. If one does not take refuge in the Three Treasures, one will certainly sink into the crooked paths, be overturned and bewildered. All those who cultivate the True and study the Way, who with devoted heart take refuge, must consider it as a rare and precious encounter.

First, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Way, and wish that all beings may always serve the Heavenly Exalted, and forever escape the wheel of rebirth. Second, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Scripture, and wish that all beings in every generation may hear the correct Dharma. Third, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Master, and wish that all beings may learn the highest vehicle, and not fall into wrong views.

These Threefold Refuges were in ancient times the first step and the foremost gateway for the sages and worthies to deliver men into the Way. To become immortal and attain the Way, to become sage and worthy, all without exception begin with these Threefold Refuges. Why is this? Because the matters of our nature, life and death, great events and causal conditions, are subtle and secret, hard to see and hear. The highest vehicle of liberation and wondrous Dharma, without the Master’s true compassion and guidance, awakening the spirit’s understanding, how can one suddenly realize the great vehicle’s orthodox principle, gradually enter the wondrous Way of emptiness, and not fall into wrong views or stray into side doors? Therefore, those who have not yet clearly understood the Way must first take refuge in the Scripture. Those who have not yet clearly understood the Scripture must first take refuge in the Master. If one can take refuge in the treasure of the Master, then the treasure of the Scripture may be heard amid the unheard; if one can hear the treasure of the Scripture, then the treasure of the Way may be seen amid the unseen. What was formerly unseen and unheard, once suddenly illuminated and penetrated, is all due to the power of taking refuge in the treasure of the Master. Thereby one naturally realizes the true texts, understands the correct Dharma, transcends life and death, and does not fall into the wheel of rebirth.

But the Threefold Refuges I speak of must be true Three Treasures. Why so? Hearken, all you people! Nowadays, the Threefold Refuges are regarded as common and ordinary, repeated morning and night before the holy images, recited and worshipped, yet the true foundation of refuge is not thoroughly comprehended, nor the reason of resort made clear. Hence do you all sink deeply into wrong Dharma and cannot avoid the wheel of rebirth. How can you then comprehend the great Way, or escape from life and death?

The Threefold Refuge spoken of is thus:  
To take refuge in the mind, so that the thought arises without birth or death — then the treasure of the Way may be attained and made manifest.  
To take refuge in the heart, so that the faculties encounter no obstruction — then the treasure of the Scripture may be attained and realized.  
To take refuge in the body, so that the eyes see not, the ears hear not, the nose smells not, the tongue tastes not, the hands do not act rashly, the feet do not move falsely, free from contamination by perverse lusts and cunning defilements, practising austerities with diligence, exhausting the sinews and bones, starving the flesh, restraining the limbs, renouncing the body — then the treasure of the Master may be attained and moved.  
He who can move the Master’s compassion and transmit the Scripture and teach the Way must first take refuge in his own body, heart, and mind; this is the true Three Treasures. If my bodily ears and eyes cannot forget their seeing and hearing, it is not bewilderment in form, but attachment to emptiness. As long as sound and colour remain, the body is not true. How then can the body that is not true move the Master? If one can hold the body upright, cultivate and seek the root, and have the mind accord with the true constant, then every thought is void, calm and serene; this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures. If the body is free from perverse lust, then the treasure of the Master may be moved; if the heart is not darkened in spirit, then the treasure of the Scripture may be realized; if the mind is not divided in purpose, then the treasure of the Way may be made clear. If the body is firm, then the essence is complete and the form healthy; if the heart is clear, then the qi is pure and wisdom penetrates; if the mind is sincere, then the spirit is concentrated and nature manifest. When essence and qi are sufficient, spirit and understanding transform, wondrous and unfathomable — all proceed from taking refuge in the body, heart, and mind, the Threefold Treasure of the self. Thus the Way, the Scripture, and the Master arise therefrom.

Moreover, how then shall one take refuge in the Three Treasures of body, heart, and mind? Hearken, all of you! Each with devoted heart, listen attentively, I now explain the method of taking refuge in the Three Treasures of body, heart, and mind, that you may dispel darkness and remove doubts. Hearken, all of you! This body is the essence of the father and blood of the mother, formed from their union; temperament, nature, countenance, and limbs all grow from the foetus. A lump of filth, a sack of the four elements; the eyes see and the ears hear, the feet walk and the hands move, the mouth speaks and the tongue tastes — none of these are enduring or good in themselves. If used well, one becomes immortal or Buddha, sage or worthy; if used ill, one becomes demon or fiend, ghost or beast. Turning upward, one may ascend to heaven; turning downward, one may descend to hell. Those who receive blessings regard this as external, those who receive evil regard this as foundation. How much more, then, you who have left home seeking to transcend life and death must take refuge in this body; only then is it proper. Otherwise, the six roots act externally, the three poisons arise within. Ten thousand calamities, a thousand disasters, nine devils, ten difficulties, all arise from the body. How can one cultivate and enter the Way?

If you would take refuge, there is but one method: to control this body. You must observe precepts and restrain the wild flesh. Using the four great demeanours as rule, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, you must bind yourself with dignity. Make the ears not hear sounds, the eyes not see colours, present a graceful and wondrous appearance, upright and compassionate; so that men see and rejoice, and also are filled with reverence. The precepts restrain the wild body, transforming it into the Dharma-body, and thus the treasure of the Master may be taken as refuge. Hearken, all of you! This first method having been indicated, the next is to take refuge in the heart.

The heart is different from the body. It is treacherous, changeful, and incalculable, like wind blowing over the deep sea; the sea is profound and the wind fierce, waves and tides surge and roll, rising and falling unpredictably, tossing and turning hard to rely upon. Since times immemorial, there has been no day of escape, the sea of suffering boundless. Now if you would take refuge in this heart, you must understand it is a lump of flesh and blood, not enduring nor good. It feasts on sounds and delights in colours, fearing not to break precepts and suffer punishment; fond of sweet food and drinks, caring not to lose body and life. It sinks into hungry ghosts and beasts without fear; is sent to the mountain of knives and fires without alarm; flows into plagues and pestilences without refusal; plays with falling stars and mountain collapses without avoidance. All kinds of calamities are caused and invited by this heart. The six thieves are its vanguard, the seven passions its commanders. If one desires to cultivate but does not take refuge in this heart, how can one suppress demons and subdue monsters, remove the seven hindrances and eliminate evil, penetrate primal causes, understand the correct Dharma, and finely discern the essential principles and directly enter the highest vehicle?

Yet to control this heart one must also observe precepts, sit in meditation, restrain the reins and lash the whip, turn back the wind and extinguish the flame. When the fire of ignorance does not flare forth, it may be overcome by the water of patience. Transform the fierce flame into the wind of wisdom, change ignorance into great intelligence. Turn evil causes into good effects, dissolve sorrow and resentment into joy. Dispel sounds and colours as floating dust, change laziness and neglect into respect. Without rising to dull filth, without distinguishing right and wrong, without allowing the contest of coming and going, of advance and retreat, or shifting of gain and loss, or revolving turmoil, naturally the qi is settled and the heart is peaceful; when the heart is peaceful and the qi is settled, then the treasure of the Scripture may be taken as refuge. Hearken, all of you! When you have the power of concentration, subdue the wild heart of flesh and blood, then the waves calm, the wind is still, the waters are even, the moon rises, pearls shine with light, wisdom penetrates the Scriptural storehouses, and understanding reaches the Scriptural explication.

Yet again you must take refuge in this mind. The mind is more difficult to control than the heart. The heart seeks correctness, but the mind aims at sincerity. Sincerity means carefulness and minuteness. When settled, it is within the minutiae, clear and distinct, without the slightest concealment, unchanging and unceasing, movement and stillness alike, and the light illumines everywhere. Therefore, before taking refuge in the mind, one is yet afraid of the settled and tranquil heart. Secretly engaging control and power, mechanical cunning and deceit; illusions and confusions, coming and going at will. Many artifices, extinguishing and arising suddenly; waves and billows of skillful forms, like dragons or tigers. Impossible to seize, as shadows or wind; though able to be grasped, formless and unseen. An inch of mechanism may shoot a weight of a thousand pounds, without sound to be heard; a drop in a boat may hold ten thousand hu, with schemes and plans innumerable. Unfathomable spiritual powers, exchanging sun and stealing heaven, boundless stratagems — after taking refuge in the mind, all vanish like water dissolving tiles, myriad phenomena returning to springtime. Thereby one may enter sagehood and attain truth, ascend immortality and perfect the Way. In the common world, transform and guide; the state will be governed and the people at peace, the seasons harmonious and the years fruitful; loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness, humility, purity, and integrity — all arise from the sincerity of the mind; the three bonds and five relations proceed from sincerity; the nine schools and three teachings are born from sincerity. Between sincerity and insincerity lie calamity and blessing, disaster and good fortune, success and failure, all dependent upon this mind. It is the causal condition of nature and life, the fruit of the wheel of rebirth.

Hearken, all of you! If you do not take refuge in this mind, your heart will be hard to settle. If you desire settle, take refuge in this mind. The light of wisdom then naturally shines forth; awakening may then be clearly understood. Before the arising of this thought it is pure and limpid; at the moment this thought arises, it may be evil or good. Without darkening the spirit’s light, the mechanism turns on the pivot, the stars follow the Dipper’s movement. When this mind is sincere, the power over life and death may be grasped; when this mind is not sincere, who then wields the handle of the wheel of rebirth?

Hearken, all of you! The treasure of mind within yourselves, a thought true and pure, above it may reach Heaven, below it may fathom the depths. Ghosts and spirits lose colour through this mind; sun and moon lose brightness through this mind; creation loses its power through this mind; yin and yang lose their order through this mind; demons and monsters flee through this mind; men and things disappear through this mind. Within and without the Three Realms, only the mind is supreme. Let it be released, and it is; let it be retracted, and it is not. Free to move here and there, nothing is not this mind. Above it bows to the Primordial as the ancestral qi; below it returns to the Spiritual Treasure as the Brahman qi; below that it relies on the Highest as true qi; it stretches out universally as vast qi; condenses warmly and gently as primal qi; compassion, mercy, and benevolence as yang qi; sorrow, anger, and punishment as yin qi; greed, hatred, agitation, and violence as blood qi; lust, killing, stealing, and falsehood as evil qi; attachment and obstruction as demon qi; cruelty and darkness as fiend qi; calamity and oppression as hostile qi — all arise from the multitude.

If the body does not take refuge in the treasure of the Master, it indulges in violence and strength. If the heart does not take refuge in the treasure of the Scripture, it remains confused and dark. If the mind does not take refuge in the treasure of the Way, it is confused and troubled. Skewed and insincere, insincerity loses the middle path; losing the middle path, wisdom-light does not arise; concentration is not firm; precepts are not strict; the spirit cannot concentrate; the qi cannot gather; the essence cannot transform. Hence the body cannot be cultivated, the heart cannot be settled, the mind cannot be sincere.

Hearken, all of you! I now plainly point out the great Way, directly to the human heart. If you do not quickly subdue body, heart, and mind, transform them into the true body of the Three Treasures, and thus be delivered from the wheel of rebirth; then first take refuge in the Three Treasures of the Worldly Foreknowers, Foreknowers of the Way, the Scriptures, and the Masters; so as not to have wasted the good cause of leaving home. If there be any who can rely on the three great gates of precept, concentration, and wisdom, practice with sincerity, and not be idle, wavering, or regretful, know that such a one is surely to attain the Way. If there be any who have the least deviation, who cannot hold fast, who are slack in themselves, know that such a one has deep guilt and scant blessing, cannot understand the Way, is not admitted by the heavenly spirits — how then can he hear the unsurpassed, most true, pure, tranquil, and liberated Way? When meeting such persons, be careful not to chide or scold; rather cultivate compassion, use skillful means, and kindly lead them into the Way. This is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures.

Then the disciples of the precepts all bowed their heads, took refuge, and composed a hymn, saying:  
'The great Way is pure and empty, beyond naming;  
It is set forth in text by subtle and wondrous Scripture.  
If not for the Master expounding the primal principle,  
How could the confused and foolish be made clear?  
Bright and continuous, called perfect truth,  
Fully attaining true essence, escaping life and death.  
Foreknowing and foreawakening, compassionate and earnest,  
Endless are the worthy, guiding into the gate.'
