# Severing and Removing Obstacles

Those who practise the Way, if their obstacles be not severed, then their path is closed and they are benumbed; if their hindrances be not removed, then they are foolish, stubborn, and obscure. The substance of the heart is originally one with Heaven and Sun; yet false emotions are but floating clouds. When fog obscures the azure sky, how can the bright sun shine clearly? When passions bewilder the spiritual orifices, how can the true mechanism attain perfect intercourse? Is this not a great disease of the practitioners of the Way? Now I point out the root of the disease. The obstacles in the Way are of two kinds; one is called the obstacle of principle, the other the obstacle of affairs. If one does not understand these affairs, the true and the false are hard to distinguish; if one does not understand their principle, the right and the wrong are difficult to discern. If one holds to principle and yet judges by affairs, embracing mud and pedantry, one has the mind of the obstacle of principle; if one carries out affairs and yet harms principle, being perverse and contrary, one is the thief of one's nature in the obstacle of affairs. Whether it be principle or affairs, all that is held fast is an obstacle.

Now I will carefully explain the two characters, ‘obstacle’ and ‘hindrance.’ The multitude, in the thousands of scriptures and myriads of canons, are all the words of the foreknowing ancients, who wished that later generations might do good and learn what is good, comprehend the Way and cultivate the true. Sentient beings do not do good but do evil; they do not learn what is good but learn what is evil; they do not cultivate the true but play with the false; they do not comprehend the Way but ruin the teaching. This is called the obstacle of affairs to the original heart. There are also those who have gone forth from the world, who do good and hold fast to good, learn good and hold fast to good, cultivate the true with earnestness, comprehend the Way but cling to appearance and perish with their tracks; all this comes from preference and they have not yet completely freed themselves. This is called the obstacle of principle to the original heart. Yet these two obstacles of principle and affairs belong to a class of those who are higher in rank. Moreover, there is a still higher class of practitioners, whose hearts and ground are not yet clear, whose heavenly mechanism has not yet turned; everywhere there arise obstacles. When they see us, those higher persons, preaching the scriptures and teaching the precepts, they praise us openly, but secretly stir up ignorance and produce the obstacle-mind, moving the thought of ignorance.

O multitude, if this obstacle-mind be not removed, how can one escape from the sea of suffering? Although there be ships and rafts, sails and oars, clearly able to cross the sea, yet one cannot cross, and dares not cross; whence comes this? Know that this obstacle-mind is like a sudden rising of black clouds in the sky, rolling in vast array, bringing wind and rain, and surely great waves and perilous billows. Therefore one dares not cross, and cannot cross.

O multitude, the sea of suffering is boundless; to turn back is to reach the shore. The obstacles of the practitioner are like clouds of black smoke arising everywhere, a turbulent and sky-covering image; when these are severed and removed, it is like the waves subsiding and the wind being still; in peace and freedom one can cross the sea of suffering. Have you not heard in the “Supreme Jade Emperor’s Original Practice Collection Scripture” it is said: “Only because sentient beings are heavily hindered by obstacles, they cannot behold the compassionate face of the Sovereign Above.” And again it says: “Such obstacles ye all should sever and remove.” The “Imperial Scripture” begins by declaring the severing of obstacles.

The method to sever obstacles is to generate great wisdom; to have no arising of doubt; to have no arising of greed and anger; to have no arising of lust; to have no arising of jealousy; to have no arising of killing and harming; to have no arising of the common mind; to have no arising of common thought; to have no arising of murkiness and filth; to have no arising of sounds and colours; to have no arising of right and wrong; to have no arising of hatred and love; to have no arising of discrimination; to have no arising of pride; to have no arising of attachment. Fix the mind and clear the thoughts; all spirits are subdued; the heart is like the vast void, pure and bright within and without. Nothing is excluded or rejected. Let not external evils disturb the supreme Way, lead astray the true religion, ruin the spiritual root, or steal the supreme treasure, causing you to fall for ten thousand kalpas into the common world, entangled in the net of the mundane, attacked by ten thousand demons, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas not hearing the wondrous Dharma, with ghosts and spirits holding you in punishment, from birth to death. Therefore, you all should with sincere heart carefully guard the true religion, and not let it be lost. As said before, each should sever and remove these obstacles. These instructions are the articles of obstacles. If not severed and removed, then the six roots will be defiled, and the three karmas entangled, and purity and tranquillity will not be achieved. Without purity and tranquillity, how can one behold the compassionate face of the Sovereign Above? The seventeen great lights and the thirty kinds of merits, whence do they come? It is for this reason that the light and merit of the Sovereign Above, for all Buddhas, holy teachers, and myriad heavenly lords, the wondrous canons in three scrolls and five sections, are all accomplished through severing and removing obstacles.

O multitude, in the world there are many obstacles. The “Imperial Scripture” but points to their practices and events, that you may know their general outline and understand the gate of Heavenly Principle. You should know that the subtle obstacles of the world are myriad and multifarious, in every movement of mind and thought, hard to count. Even when reading scriptures and reciting canons, their wondrous meaning is profound and hidden; one’s own wisdom being limited, one cannot comprehend or realise it, then one knows one’s spiritual orifices are not nimble, and one’s light of wisdom is small. Yet one is unwilling to humble oneself and ask questions of the wise, and this is murkiness and filth. When one has asked and understood, yet arises doubt, fearing the teacher’s words are untrue; one asks another, and their words differ, and the mind is troubled. The myriad divergences in the myriad scriptures – is this not an obstacle? If companions study the scriptures together, and one companion is more familiar while I am not, the mind becomes vexed – is this not an obstacle? If I am familiar and the companion is not, joy arises – is this not an obstacle? If I have talent and others are dull, I deceive and cheat them – is this not an obstacle? If I see others who are good and virtuous, or giving alms, or practising merit, and he is rich while I am poor, jealousy arises; if I am rich and he poor, pride arises – is this not an obstacle? If, reading the scriptures, suddenly there is enlightenment and a faint understanding of principle, and one holds this as true and expounds it to others, but they are wiser and my heart is not convinced – is this not an obstacle? If one hears wondrous principles and clings to them, knowing only one side and not understanding flexibility – is this not an obstacle? If one practises cultivation and sitting meditation, and occasionally attains a wondrous state and boasts of it – is this not an obstacle? If companions on the Way study together, and the master says he is enlightened and I am ignorant, and I do not blame myself but resent him for being before me – is this not an obstacle? As for hoarding wealth and goods and not letting go even when at death’s door; all attachments, greed and indulgence, if not severed and removed, like fondness for musical instruments, fine books, good chess, fine paintings, and all manner of thoughts, are all obstacles. There are also those who take talismanic arts as wondrous efficacies; others regard talismanic arts as inferior means; if he rejoices and I hate, if I like and he dislikes, these are all obstacles.

O multitude, since you seek to go beyond the world and desire to escape the cycle of rebirth, you must do the work of going beyond the world, cherish the Way-work of transcendence. These obstacles are all the blockages at the spiritual passes, the illusions that bewilder awakening; how then can you transcend the world? If you are willing to sever and remove every one of these manifold obstacles, cut off all their roots, dispel miscellaneous doubts, and have a bosom as vast and open as the great void, then your spirit will be lively and active, your manifold turns will be perfectly clear, wisdom will arise spontaneously, and your nature and heaven be illuminated. In this there are a thousand wonderful efficacies, all issuing from the mechanism of birth and death and coming and going, the union of Heaven and man attained. Naturally and spontaneously, it is no longer a matter of recognition or not.

Ha ha! Obstacles, obstacles! It lies only between whether the multitude can or cannot sever them. Then the lawyer proceeded to preach the Dharma: “From the beginning of submission, the clear destiny is no empty word. Illuminating the spiritual platform, no ray is hid. When the bosom is once expanded and cleared, the sight brightens and is unclouded.”
