# Forbearance of Insult and Submission of the Heart

The chief great disease of the cultivator is the difficulty of removing and regulating the passion of anger. If not attached to the self, then attached to others; once the heart of anger stirs, it is called the fire of ignorance and karma. Among the three poisons, anger is foremost. If the heart of anger be not resolved, it burns oneself within; if angry words proceed from the mouth, it burns others without. A single spark at the spiritual gate blazes and consumes; a whole Dharma-body is consumed alive and spoiled. The six bowels cannot be purified; the five viscera cannot be harmonized. When the ear hears abuse, the fire of anger arises from the liver; the fierce flame meets with a wild wind, and that ear which could hear becomes as if a closed window, a stopped-up aperture. When the eye sees insult, the fire of anger arises from the kidney; the fierce flame meets with a wild wind, and that eye which could see becomes as if a closed gate or a barred road. The mouth involuntarily utters angry words; the heart pours forth the fire of hatred; the gall floods with poisonous schemes. Not fearing the Heaven and Earth or the divine spirits above; not fearing life and death of the body in the middle; not fearing the cauldrons of oil and the sword-wood in the nether regions; not fearing the executioners’ chopping and hanging of the officials below — yet a single tongue that can speak creates a thousand kinds of sinful karma. Why have these ears, these eyes, this mouth, this tongue, this bitter suffering? Only because this fleshy lump called the heart cannot be subdued, relying on the breath and blood, exercising power and authority. When the time comes to pacify the heart, it becomes ice-cold and serene.

All people, all beings in the world, this body is formed of the confluence of blood and breath. This root of anger, from the beginningless kalpa before, this fire of ignorance and karma was already planted. Therefore, when things go smoothly, the heart rejoices; when they do not, that joy changes into enmity. When circumstances oppose the heart, anger and wrath arise; this is the root of the cycle of kalpas. Since you have already left the home-life, originally for the purpose of escaping birth and death, if the root of anger be not cut off, then the poisonous dragon attacks the root of Heaven. Seeking to extricate the body from the net of the world, because the nature of life is deep and weighty, if this anger and hatred be not extinguished, it causes the breath to fill the lunar cave. Nature is originally good, but anger becomes the poisonous dragon; accustomed to give rise to the fire of anger, the fire burns the body; life itself normally persists, but anger becomes a fierce tiger; constantly producing poisonous breath, the breath hastens to destroy the true. The ignorance of birth and death all arises from inability to cherish life. Life is not established because the fire is strong; so that the six roots cannot be controlled, the four limbs tremble and are strained, the five senses cannot be used, the hair pores emit the nature of fire, causing a hundred harms and injuring Heaven and hastening life.

All people, to cut off anger, first lower the evil thought. What is the evil thought? It is the inability to endure insult. The great sage Confucius said: 'Be gentle and lenient in teaching, and do not repay the unrighteous with evil.' If the heart in its bosom cannot endure, then day by day it is as a wicked man. How can a wicked man enter the Way? All people who cannot endure insult have hearts that cannot be subdued, like poisonous dragons and fierce tigers; they know only how to insult others, and cannot bear to be insulted themselves. Loving strength and victory, they seize upon gain before others, making their breath a weapon, their voice harsh and severe; selling themselves as heroes, acting as champions; contending for profit and fame, boasting of achievements and power, serving the strong and oppressing the weak. Though sometimes their hearts are warm for the people, not knowing whether they can save them, they will certainly be able to destroy them. Sentient beings are bewildered and do not awaken; how could they have forethought or deep reflection? The way of Heaven is lofty; grudges remain unresolved because the root of anger is unbroken. Anger inevitably desires to insult others, and will not bear that I be insulted. Not knowing that to suffer insult from others and to insult others are widely different.

All people, the word insult embraces a wide range. Suppose a man debauches another’s wife or concubine, yet he does not consider that her husband is insulted, nor her children and grandchildren, nor her ancestors, nor her clan and family. But when another debauches his own wife or concubine, anger arises; great evil is born; thinking that this man has defiled my wife and concubine, what face do I have left? If others hear it, not only am I dishonoured, but the merits of my parents and ancestors, the family customs of my descendants, are all defiled and ruined; can I let him go? Then he must be taken up with knife and rod, anger must be kindled, and murderous intent at once arise. No more thinking that if he insults me, I will do so likewise; if I do not insult him, what then? If in this life wife or daughter are debauched by others, surely there are evil causes from former lives. The evil deeds of debauching wives and daughters in former lives bring debauchery upon the wives and daughters in this life. This is the inevitable cause and effect among men. You all, having heard these words, must by no means allow the mind of lust to arise. I say directly to the assembly, these lives of men all arise from lust. If the mind of lust be not removed, the root of birth and death is not cut off. Because of lust arises the coloured body; to escape the coloured body, the desire must be washed away; if desire is removed, then within the corrupted coloured body the Dharma-body arises, and only then can birth and death be ended. This is our true word; do not treat it as idle talk to let it pass.

Recently a disciple, who in ordinary days had very much thought upon the Way, suddenly went out seeking alms food, begging at a rice shop. The master of the shop, being loving of the Way, rejoiced, invited the disciple into the main hall to sit, kowtowed and offered alms, and placed one qian of broken roots into the alms bowl. When leaving the hall, the disciple met his wife passing along the corridor; at the sight of her, the wife averted her face but was too late; the disciple thanked and left. Having seen his wife, at night sitting in meditation, his mind ran to her, he imitated her face, and then lust arose; he knelt, burned incense, confessed and lay down. Suddenly he knew he was dead, embraced within the womb, grew up, took a wife, was fair and handsome, and lived in harmony with his spouse. Going outside by the roadside, he saw a Daoist seeking alms food, and his heart rejoiced. Returning home, he offered alms and made merit, called his wife out to meet him, and kowtowed. Turning, he saw the Daoist, beckoned to his wife with his hand, and in his heart was greatly angry. He ran straight into the kitchen, took a vegetable knife to strike the Daoist. He stumbled and fell, awakening with anger and hatred, and found it was a dream, his whole body sweat-drenched. Reflecting on the Daoist, his features were those of the rice shop master; his wife was the woman met in the corridor of the rice shop. All people, this disciple was a beginner in cultivation; though his observances were firm, his concentration was not yet steady; therefore, day and night he thought deeply, and suddenly false views and false thoughts arose, entering the dream as a real scene.

Again, another cultivator, firm in precepts, never speaking false words, and with the mind unmoved by false thoughts, when insulted did not harbour anger, did not strike back, did not respond to words of abuse, but only thought himself at fault, and did not blame others. One day, carrying a shoulder-pole on the road, he met a donkey rushing at him; he moved aside for the donkey, but the donkey suddenly butted him with its head; the man could not avoid and fell to the ground; the donkey bit his clothes, tore them, and went away. At night sitting in meditation, entering a state of faintness, suddenly a man in white appeared and thanked him: 'I am the donkey that rushed you on the road. In former kalpas we had made grudges and repayings, but now the resentment is released, both released and freed, and henceforth freed from suffering and rebirth among men; I have come to inform you. On the day of the moon’s appearance, come to a certain place to meet, to seek transcendence.' Having spoken, he departed. The cultivator clearly saw, heard and knew it as if a dream but not a dream; he rose and continued meditation as usual. On the appointed day of the next month, he came to the place; the household was full of joy, as if some good event had occurred. He inquired of others, and all said the family had a child born during the night. The cultivator heard and was greatly alarmed; he secretly recorded the name, vowed to deliver himself first, then to deliver others. All people, if you have such persons, you may make grudges that in this life must be resolved.

Disciples, you must make your own vow to endure insult and release resentment, to bear suffering and hardship, to forget shame and suffer losses, to resolve resentment and comply with calamity, to subdue this heart, and bear all things. Holding firmly the knife of precepts, you must at all times slay the fire of ignorance, and at all moments clothe yourself in the garment of forbearance. Hearing others strike and abuse, sweetly suffer being wronged; enduring reproach and slanders, following others’ shame and insult, none of these can break my vow of precepts. Even if unjustly entangled, by the laws of kings, the magistrates’ punishments, thunderbolt from the blue sky, fire and lightning, all floods and robberies and calamities, wolf bites and tiger scratches, poisons and snake bites, demon oppression and ghost bewilderment, monster entanglement and spirit harm, the world’s desire for violent words and twisted speech, the ruin of reputation, enemies’ evil curses, the destruction of relatives, even to the cutting off of limbs without escape or evasion, the ruin of this body — all these are the fixed causes and certain kalpas. Difficult to avoid the limits of fate that confront you. Only can you quietly accept, conform to the will of Heaven, repay old debts, and answer former causes. Do not stir up rebellious intentions to harm my precepts and rules. Rather, recall that when I am wronged, after all I have wronged others; when I am afflicted, I have afflicted others; as well as encountering demons, calamities, injuries and disasters — all were made in former lives, self-made and self-endured. From now on, after receiving the precepts, all evil karma will dissolve with the mind. Naturally the six desires will not arise, the three poisons will be extinguished, body and mind will be light and healthy, feelings and nature at peace, suffering and vexation healed, enmity and grudges resolved. All people, from the beginningless accumulation of resentment until today, let the heavenly conscience suddenly arise. Whosoever has grievances and debts, be willing to accept them, and repay one by one; harm oneself but benefit others — this is liberation. From henceforth, ever return to purity, still abiding in the constancy of great emptiness, the root of confusion; preserving the spirit and guarding silence, brewing to perfect the retribution body. If not, the debts of former kalpas not repaid to others, and the shame of this life not yielded, surely the retribution of future lives will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this heart be emptied? How can this Way be cultivated? If you now cannot endure these few words of speech, how can you at the end of birth and death be free and pure?

All people, to endure is to extinguish the fire of ignorance; naturally the five viscera become cool and clear. To endure is that the waters of the flowery pool arise; naturally the six bowels are harmonized and peaceful. To endure is that the desires of others be fulfilled; naturally resentment is released and peace established. To endure is that my mind be inclusive; naturally the chest and heart grow broad. Whosoever insults me, I do not consider it insult; the insult returns to him. If I insult others, they receive my insult and must repay insult to me. Those who can endure have peaceful mind and breath, so that the fire of the liver is not fierce, and is transformed into the southern constellation which dispels calamity. Those who can endure have moisture arising at the lungs and armpits, which moistens the stomach and abdomen, transformed into the sweet dew of the jade pool. Those who can endure have kidney essence undiminished, so that the upper and lower sources are freed from disaster, transformed into the spring of martial spirit. Those who can endure have spleen earth not dry, so that the body is light and healthy, transformed into white snow and yellow shoots. Those who can endure have the Dharma body without leak, so that the Way’s breath communicates with spirit, transformed into a solemn and wondrous appearance. Those who can endure in the country shall certainly benefit the court; those who can endure in the family shall certainly benefit the flesh and blood; those who can endure in the body shall certainly benefit the spirit; those who can endure in the heart shall certainly benefit life and nature; those who can endure in teaching shall certainly benefit the Dharma followers. Such are the benefits of endurance.

If one cannot endure insult and bear burden, then the heart is not humble, the spirit not spiritual, the breath not strong, the capacity not great, the breast not open, the wish not vast, the accomplishment not perfect, the conduct not complete, the vision not clear, the thought not deep, the wisdom small, the blessings shallow, the root foundation thin; hearing the Way is not clear, practising the Way is obstructed, hated and despised by others, arousing jealousy, receiving dislike, provoking vexation, treated with scorn, haunted by many ghosts, with dreams full of terror, the spirit bright yet fearful, afflicted with scabies, leprosy, and rashes — the root of grudges from many kalpas is not extinguished, the retribution of future lives is even deeper; the sea of suffering does not cease to surge, how can the waves arise from empty desire?

All people, have you not heard that virtue is the root; great virtue is that which is inclusive; the August Heaven has no partiality, only virtue it supports. Among you, the wise and the foolish are not equal. There are those who lose virtue by loving wealth, those who lose virtue by loving beauty, those who lose virtue by loving breath. Among these, insult may come because of wealth, or beauty, or breath; the outer circumstances differ, but insult is the same. The sage says: 'A single day’s anger causes one to forget oneself and one’s kin.' Again he says: 'Anger is hard to manage.' Zengzi says: 'If the heart harbours anger and perversity, it cannot find its right way.' Is not this precept of enduring insult weighty indeed? Is not the harm of anger and wrath poisonous indeed? Therefore the true first ancestors regard the precept of anger as the gateway; to forget anger is the Way; to endure insult is to kill the heart; to forget insult is to fulfill desire. The Scripture of Deliverance of Sufferings, the Venerable Great Unity of Heaven says: 'The fire haze becomes the clear summer heat; the sword-wood becomes a fragrant and lofty forest. To transcend the three worlds is difficult; one attains unto the Primordial Heaven of the First Origin.'

All people, be swift and earnest, hear my verse speak: 'Early remove the thought of self and other, quickly awaken to the cause of birth and death. Endure insult and quell the fire of anger, in the void manifest the Dharma body. The seven feelings vanish with the thoughts; the hundred forbearances the ancients praise. Sweetly bear the sins and karma; thus is one beyond the kalpa. Ten thousand aspects of karma are former causes; all debts must be repaid alike. Ignorant and dark, suffering loss, the fire of anger arises; a mass of grudges, black and vast. Cultivation must beware taking advantage; I take advantage but he will not comply. Through kalpas drifting, grudges unresolved; in the hall of purity many disputes. Disputes have no abiding place; the earth and sky are broad; immortals and Asuras are different. The land of bliss and coolness has much endurance; repaying insult debt, the Way’s merit is complete. This mortal body ascending the Way, why not bear human loss? Sky-high wrath and hair-fire; no place for true man nor hungry ghost.'
