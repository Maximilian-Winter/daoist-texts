# IX. Seeking the Master and Inquiring the Way

From ancient times the sages, the immortals, and the Buddhas, having attained fruit and become true, none have crossed over without a master. Therefore masters instruct one another, mouth to mouth they transmit, heart to heart they imprint. Among them the principles are connected and uniformly understood. Like milk turning into water, like glue and pitch cast together, those of the same breath seek one another, those of the same voice respond; the waters and heavens are of one hue, the lights intermingle and shine; only then can the way of master and disciple be thoroughly fulfilled.

O multitude, I see that among the world’s people, many seek masters and inquire after the Way, yet many err somewhat. There are disciples in name who transmit, but no disciples in truth who pass on the Way. Therefore today, without sparing tooth or tongue, without fearing calumny, I set forth to you the principles of seeking the master and inquiring the Way; you must keep them in your heart, so that hereafter, when first a disciple to another, you may observe this propriety; then when made master yourself, your disciples will imitate and follow the ancient models, and so reverence the master because he honours the Way.

O multitude, the foolish and blind of the world know not their own hearts, following the changes of things. Though they have thoughts of the Way, they know not the gate of right and wrong; though they have hearts for the Way, they know not the methods of cultivation. They hear men say, "Nature is self-enlightened, destiny is transmitted by the master," and thus they follow these words. Or they meet a certain Daoist going upward, clad in tattered robes, shod with straw sandals, waving a fan of palm leaves, bearing a meditation cushion, passing through the cities. Or sitting down in the streets, holding a gourd for alms; or slow-walking on the path, free and untroubled. Meeting a palace temple, they settle down; encountering a shrine, they lodge there. Their mouths discourse in formulas, their tongues sound like pipes and reed instruments. How can this be the wondrous gate of the mysterious pass, the lower gate beneath the tailbone, the sea bottom, reaching above to the Mud Pellet Palace, below to the Bubbling Spring Acupoint? Guarding the centre and raising the vital breath, setting up the cauldron and installing the furnace. Prolonging life and repelling sickness, massage and guiding the qi. The six-character formula, the eight-section brocade, the Awakening to the True, Harmony of the Three—also the alchemical scriptures' metaphors: lead and mercury dragons and tigers, the silver sand couple, the sun and moon hexagrams and lines, the tortoise and snake nurtured warmly, bathing and forming the embryo, entering the chamber and sitting in the circle, the emergence of yin spirit, the emergence of yang spirit. The inexhaustible three thousand six hundred side-doors, eighty-four thousand demonic arts—who can reckon them all? O multitude, these foolish and blind ones, their hearts without wisdom, how can they discern true from false, or know right from wrong? They listen to such Daoists. More hateful still are those who discourse of cauldrons and vessels, the sorcerers who refine "mao silver," beguiling men with beauty and wealth. Not to speak of their being no true Way, even if there were, could such vulgar men transmute gold or extend life? Therefore those who speak of cauldrons, upon seeing beauty arise in heart, stirred by the circumstances, their spirits flutter and souls roam; true mercury runs downward, original heaven overturns, the supreme treasure is voided, many fall into consumption, never continuing their destiny, severing even their vital link—are not these hateful and grievous? As for those who burn "mao silver," speak of sand and minerals, turning this way and that, warming and opening the points, there is no end to their schemes and deceits; the foolish and greedy often ruin their families. Compared with those Daoists mentioned before, their guilt is multiplied manyfold. I cannot bear to speak in detail, lest I provoke slander. But those who have taken the precepts must listen now to the general principles of seeking the master and inquiring the Way.

O multitude, this Sovereign Heaven’s Supreme Way is vague and indistinct, dim and obscure; most vast, most great, most high and most exalted; most mysterious and hidden, most secluded and remote. Its greatness has no outside, its minuteness no inside. It can pass through heaven and weave the earth, entering the obscure and the dark; as if existing and not existing; entering water without wetness, entering fire without burning; before it there was no antiquity, after it there is no present; it gives birth to heaven and earth; it moves the sun and moon; it nourishes all things; giving birth to sages and worthies, to immortals and Buddhas. The moving and containing spirits, insects, grasses, and trees, no one is without it, no place is without its presence. In daily use, ordinary things are all wondrous Ways. Only because the common people use it daily yet know it not, the lowly minds are confused and do not awaken; hence one true is lost, and for countless kalpas it is hard to illuminate. Before father and mother gave birth, the true spirit knows not its beginning; after the spirit departs, this body knows not its end. Upside down, revolving, reincarnating, birth and death are anguish and suffering. Therefore I point out the source and root, teaching men to hasten to seek a true master, to early hear the Supreme Way.

Yet the true master is hard to behold, the high disciple hard to meet. Know that if the disciple has not a heart transcending the world, obstructing and closing the wisdom nature, though he meet a true master, ghosts and spirits will prevent him from seeing, conceal his wisdom, so that seeing he cannot recognize the truth; if the master has not the mind to deliver the world, though he meet a high disciple, ghosts and spirits likewise will not allow him to see, conceal his dharma eye; seeing no affinity, what he utters face to face is often missed. O multitude, the master seeks the disciple as one seeks a needle in a heap of mustard seed; the disciple seeks the master as one tries to catch the moon in the water. The true master is hard to attain, the high disciple hard to seek; it is not a matter of wealth or treasure, but only of one sincere thought in the heart. Have you seen any master of the Way who would rashly transmit to evil men? Have you seen any sage who would disorderly receive a master? O multitude, the master will not rashly transmit, for such a master embraces the Supreme Way and seeks a high disciple. The disciple will not rashly pay homage to a master, for such a one is discerning and wary. Were such as these unwilling to lightly cast themselves to masters or rashly pay homage to Daoists, their hearts free of obstruction, their wills fixed on the dust-ring, their vision wide, their minds broad, when meeting a master of the Way, they would naturally see clearly; they could speak of it, recognize it thoroughly; a word or half a phrase, a mustard seed thrown at a needle, the needle’s eye receiving it. Were such masters not rash in receiving disciples and rash in transmitting, and meeting such wise disciples, could they fail to delight in questioning and answering, to discourse broadly, to expound subtle formulas, to reveal secret heavenly mechanisms, to teach profound mysteries, to transmit the Supreme Way by heart, and orally instruct the principles of the Heavenly Writ?

O multitude, true masters are not few, disciples are many. Now I tell you how it is that true masters are not few. O multitude, your six roots of sense each have a true master; if your ears hear good words, and you truly believe and accept these good words, then your ear root is an introducer of masters, and these good words are the masters transmitting the Way; the other five roots are likewise so. O multitude, learning has no constant master, only the Way is master. Whenever your ears hear good and kind words, you should keep your spirit silent and listen, as if sweet dew distilling on the heart, as if fresh cream poured on the head, keeping your heart silently responsive to this person; opening my ignorance and confusion, with compassion and expedient means, wishing that those who proclaim good words may early attain the mysterious功, gain the supreme Way—is this not master and disciple? Suppose your eyes see all the scriptures, the words of the three teachings, the true words and secrets, your heart’s understanding enlightened, then you should reverence and praise them; such words are those you recognize as true and trust utterly, and naturally master and disciple meet. Yet the master’s merciful ferry and dharma bridge is not one single method. Mencius said, "Teaching has many methods: some perfect virtue, some develop talent, some answer questions, some teach privately; all are but instruction." Thus some meet and rejoice at once, meeting face to face and casting themselves to one another; some bow with heads and knees, mutually not refusing; some bow low and receive transmission; some pledge gold and swear oaths before transmission. Reverence is the beginning of ritual. Reverence without sincerity is not reverence. It depends on observing the disciple’s faithfulness and earnest practice, respecting the master and esteeming the Way. Therefore there are those who undergo repeated trials before transmission, like Yun-fang’s ten trials of Dong-bin; those who bow the body before they are seen, like Liu Xuande’s three visits to the straw hut; some follow the master many years without their hearts turning back; some, though knowing the true sincerity, are tested with many hardships. This transmission of the Way and receiving teaching is no small matter, nor lightly obtained. Therefore there are those with three mouths that speak not, six ears that transmit not the Way. For the highest Way and Dharma cannot be transmitted to the middling and low; the middling and low Way cannot be transmitted to the most wise. It depends on teaching according to the person. As Confucius’ disciple Ran You asked, "Having heard, shall I practice it?" The Master said, "Having heard, practice it." Zilu asked, "Having heard, shall I practice it? But my father and elder brothers are present; how then shall I practice it?" He sought to retreat, so he was guided forward; he was drawn along with others, so he was guided back; this mutual listening was not possible. Therefore Gongxi Hua heard both and was confused. As for the Master and his disciples asking about benevolence, there were many questions and many differing answers; this is so. Some believe with one heart, some hear but once; the one who believes may be spoken of, but the one who hears but once cannot. Therefore it is said, "Do not lightly regard what is easily obtained."

O multitude, some may transmit the Way among a thousand or a hundred men, and among them the wise obtain it easily and understand; the dull find it hard to practice. Loudly reading aloud, making the mysteries clear, those with intention receive the record; those with intention but without affinity, the wind blows past their ears, and they hear as if in vain. O multitude, Shakyamuni Buddha, holding up a flower before the assembly, said, "I have the wondrous bright true nature, the Nirvana wondrous heart, the treasury of the correct Dharma eye; can men see this?" Only Kāśyapa, holding up the flower, smiled. O multitude, Kāśyapa and Shakyamuni, openly building plank roads, secretly crossing Chen Cang; before the great assembly, secretly transmitting the secret Way, heart to heart imprinting, mouth to mouth transmitting; yet those seated in the assembly knew not what was transmitted nor what was received. Likewise Confucius the great sage, before the array of sages and worthies, said to Zengzi, "The Way of my teaching is one and continuous." Zengzi said, "Yes." At that time there were many disciples; was not the sage transmitting the Way before all the disciples, and Zengzi grasping the Way within the disciples? The multitude know not their own hearts, so though they meet it, they do not meet it; they know not what is transmitted nor what is grasped. Zengzi understood deeply his own nature, and thus naturally accorded with the sage’s heart. In former days the Yellow Emperor went to Mount Kongdong to seek the Way from Guangchengzi. Repeatedly he entreated, but Guangchengzi gave no answer. The Emperor retired and practised purification, dwelling quietly three months; then again he went to invite him downwind, approaching on knees, humble and modest, and asked the essentials of the Supreme Way. Guangchengzi then answered: "The essence of the Supreme Way is profound and obscure; the extreme of the Supreme Way is dark and silent. No seeing, no hearing; embracing the spirit in stillness; form will correct itself. Must be still and clear, do not labour your form, do not let your thoughts be busy; then you may have long life. Guard your exterior, close your interior; much wisdom is ruin. I keep to the One and dwell in harmony; thus for twelve hundred years I have not grown old." With these few straightforward words he spoke to the Emperor face to face, and the Emperor then ceased to speak. If you follow them, it is your choice; if you do not, it is your choice. This is called each fulfilling his own Way.

O multitude, in our Daoist gate, the Way and Virtue of Nanhua have many wondrous meanings; the texts of empty purity, many true words; also the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the thirty-six marvels, and countless scriptures! Who can clear the ear root, reverently listen to the wondrous reproaches of the holy scriptures; open the vision, transcend and awaken to the great Way in words and expounding? Failing to awaken, the heart is not bright; though meeting a sage master, one still does not recognize.

O multitude, before seeking a master, first seek yourself; before asking after the Way, first ask your own heart. If you do not act according to discipline, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain a master and receive the Way’s seal. The crucial point is that you be humble and lowly, first removing all pride and arrogance, utterly cleansing and pruning them away; soft, gentle, and yielding. Remove all thoughts of calumny and jealousy. Meeting men, do not boast of your ability, only fearing that someone may be able to rival you. If meeting a clear-eyed sage, a man of empty heart and lofty will, one or two words cut you to the waist, how will you struggle to escape? Naturally the snow melts and the corpse is seen; you cannot escape the discerning. Now I earnestly exhort the multitude: seeking the master and inquiring the Way is not to be done hastily. Before asking the master, kowtow several times; hear the master’s title a few times; nowadays disciples slight the master and scorn the Way, this is everywhere. O multitude, you must urgently examine yourselves, before the ancestors of old masters, repent your arrogance and contempt, change your old habits, respect the dharma treasures. If your heart is truly sincere and earnest, keeping your eyes open to seek the master, then Heaven will not fail man; the immortals and sages will come of themselves, no need to limit by near or far, early or late. Hear my verse and ponder:

“Seeking the master requires conquering self;  
Inquiring the Way demands sincere heart.  
With sincere heart the Way is understood;  
With earnest thought good causes are met.  
In myriad kalpas rare the meeting;  
In thousand lives this chance attained.  
If you grasp my words aright,  
Sudden enlightenment roots unborn.”
