# Repaying Kindness and Dispelling Calamities

Beloved assembly, since you have renounced the world and taken the way of the recluse, seeking to transcend the world, the thousand lives of ancient karmic debts, the accumulated resentments of many generations, all must be confessed and extinguished, henceforth to be destroyed and no more reborn, only then can you clearly understand the bitter recompense of repayment and requital. This teaching, however, is still that of the lower vehicle and inferior retribution; it is for those who flee their debts and grievances, who fear death and crave life, men of small ambition and little ability, the inferior disciples. Such persons’ hearts are not clear, their innate nature not yet manifested; they seek only the present and regard not the future life. Now I will tell you, regarding these external ways, one matter, that you may know, understand.

There was a Daoist who became a recluse halfway on the road, traveling and visiting, who met several companions and jointly made vows, establishing a hut on Liao Mountain in Shandong to cultivate. Later, because of war and disorder, they descended the mountain together, settling beneath Wangwu Mountain in Henan, sitting in solitary meditation. Six men in one place; though they dwelt together, their aspirations differed, each having his own skill. After a year, three departed. Only three remained, who renewed their vows together, all seeking to transcend the world. Later, among these three, one first left his body in sitting meditation; the two remaining were more resolute. Soon after, another likewise left his body, leaving but one, solitary and alone in his cultivation. In meditation, he entered samadhi and his soul journeyed to Tiantai Mountain, where he suddenly met his fellow Daoist who had already passed on; the two rejoiced greatly. The departed said: “Fortune has brought us together; I will tell you: you may change the vow you made the year before last. That day I vowed to cultivate so as to repent my grievances and seek liberation. But who knew that on the day my dust was to be wiped away, when I reached the Three Gates, I was examined by the official Cao, who loudly commanded: ‘This man’s root of grievance still remains; his calamity is hard to escape. His name is not on the heavenly list; he has no place on the elixir platform; he cannot advance. He may go to Yuntai Mountain and receive a post at the San Yuan Assembly Bureau.’ Immediately a fierce wind and cold qi obscured the Heavenly Gate, and I saw it no more. I found myself at the San Yuan Bureau, before the Three Officials. They lightly examined me and said: ‘You are of the inferior vehicle and petty ambition, a side path, falsely imagining transcendence. For now, we consider your ignorance of the path, and the mountain god of Tongbai Palace at Tiantai is lacking a post. You shall go there and temporarily take charge until a vacancy occurs in the Underworld; then you shall be properly appointed.’ I earnestly entreated for instruction, to aid my cultivation in the nether regions. The Three Officials, with kindly faces, commanded: ‘When you sat on your mat in meditation, your thoughts were not pure, your mind not empty; you did not see through that the form-body is emptiness, the nature-spirit is reality, you did not realize that emptiness is not empty. You only know that the thousand lives of grievances must be confessed and the accumulated resentments extinguished; since taking the way, you think that your grievances and debts will not be reborn. But you have never deeply and thoroughly penetrated how in the nature-spirit the resentments are extinguished, how grievances are confessed. Who says that because you have accumulated grievances over many kalpas and generated resentments in many lives, that by mere words and thoughts you can cast off the grievances and guilt as the wind scatters? You must enter the gate, establish your resolve, and learn the supreme vehicle, the great root and great vessel, with a heart to universally save. In the supreme vehicle and great vessel, the ordinary mind is instantly extinguished; their heaven and earth are all empty, phantom forms become ashes; self and other are one. Yet even such a person cannot easily resolve the burden of ancient karmic debts and grievances; bearing wealth and life, how could they be lightly regarded? Therefore, the ancient Buddha King Ari, who cut off his limbs to repay old sins, was not attached in the least, and thus attained Shakyamuni’s enlightenment. The Sixth Patriarch washed clean his deep grudges and took them up subtly, thus attesting to the Western Heaven’s great mirror. Now your ambition is small, your root poor; you will not repay grievances and debts, but only seek to escape suffering. You regard the form-body as too real, fearing only the coming of retaliation: the punishments, beatings, killings, and pain. Your sole wish is for the body to be always happy; this selfish fear of repayment is a poor root, the mark of the lower vehicle. If the root of grievance is not emptied, and after rebirth the karmic causes remain, and in future lives you meet again, your taking the way is but fleeing suffering. You cannot transcend suffering; kalpa after kalpa you are entangled; generation after generation you are connected. All because your initial vow was weak and your ambition narrow. This life’s renunciation is merely called cultivating blessings, not cultivating the way; you should return to the wheel of rebirth, turning in the womb of great blessings. Only because you once recited one hundred scrolls of the Emperor’s Law and the Mi Luo sacred name for three years, with sincere and earnest mind, were you appointed to the post of a true man, entitled to the rank in the Underworld Court. Now, because you serve as master of ceremonies to chant scriptures in the world, you have not neglected your duties. As for receiving money and gifts, you have already dispersed them; you should be given merit, promoted one rank. The register has entered your name: you are appointed Deputy Mountain God of the Grotto Heaven; go quickly to govern, cultivate in the nether regions, and do not neglect your work.’ I then suddenly awakened and repented that my ambition was not great. I began to understand that small causes yield small results, great vows yield great recompense. Now I repent too late; I am just about to enter your pure and enlightened realm to speak to you. Because each holds to his post, they dare not leave the mountain border to roam. Now your coming is timely; you may go and renew your vow. For all grievances, neither refuse revenge nor retreat with one heart; only then is the fruit great. If there remains any hesitation or fear, there will be a test of escape; even if you gain the fruit, it will not be great.’ When he had spoken, he vanished. The Daoist came out of meditation, and from then knew that this was but an inferior external way, a solitary cultivation that leads to guarding the mountain as a spirit in the future. Urgently he burned the grass hut, took his mat, gourd, and staff, and again pondered deeply the use of mind and heart. He endured all disgrace, suffered all pains, cultivated all practices, drove out distractions, and tempered body and mind. He vowed that if he had grievances, he would not avoid sword or axe. He regarded this fleshly body as finite; he held pure and reverently this innate heavenly life. Without attachment or obstruction, without disturbance or fear, naked, shining, round, pure and bare, coming and going freely. He would not accept blessings though he had them; he would not refuse suffering though it came. With this one mind, many years passed. Suddenly one morning, in the quiet realm, he saw a Daoist coming forward to pay respects. Looking closely, he was the departed fellow Daoist from before, his appearance as of old, face ashamed, not daring to look up. Asked as to his coming, it was revealed that he had taken the heretical path of the master, not understanding the proper principle; often he used his spirit and breath to fix his mind on the elixir field; after long cultivation he became a corpse-guarding ghost. His light was but a foot or so, shining only on his own form and carcass; beyond him was still darkness, not a single thing visible. Now because this Daoist entered meditation, his light grew bright; he drew into his quiet realm the soul of this departed friend. After a short time, he also vanished. Only the one Daoist not yet departed increasingly comprehended the nature and principle. Life is in the nature; adding one part of comprehension adds one part of light; more light brings more wisdom; more wisdom brings more blessing; more blessing brings a higher fruit. Then he came out of meditation. This Daoist asked himself: “Have I swept clean the six roots? Have the eight consciousnesses dissolved? Are the five aggregates all empty? Are the seven emotions severed? I have taken the last refuge in the Ever-Pure, Ever-Quiet Great Heavenly Honoured One.” Yet alas, parents generate, heaven and earth nurture; the mortal body and breath have their end and limit. On the next day, at the foot of the mountain outside the gates, he said: “I now must take leave of you all, and turn back.” The assembly said: “Why such haste?” The Daoist said: “My three karma have been repaid, but the four kindnesses remain unrequited; I must be reborn to finish this one thought.” Having spoken, he clasped his hands, bowed to the void, and then completed his sitting meditation and passed on.

Beloved assembly, listen; the right and wrong of the Way differ; the great and small of the vow are not equal. These three men, looking back, their fruit and rank differ greatly. Beloved assembly, he of great resolve is a great man; he of small resolve is a small man. If the resolve is not great, the heart is not broad; if the heart is not broad, the capacity is narrow. The vow is not universal; the capacity narrow and vow narrow; knowledge shallow and view narrow; then the qi nurtured cannot be vast and mighty. If the qi is not vast and mighty, it can only fill a phantom leather bag; it cannot fill the great void, take its place in heaven and earth, penetrate the sun and moon, and illuminate all beings. How can such be called the great supreme Way?

Beloved assembly, man is born into heaven and earth, borne by them; the sun and moon shine upon him; parents nourish him; sovereign and teacher instruct him. These are called the Four Kindnesses, profound and endless, which cannot be repaid. We fall again into the form body, the five aggregates of calamity and suffering, not yet transcended; even cultivating blessing and wisdom together, it is still hard to endure forever. Beloved assembly, now that you have taken refuge under the three treasures, why do calamities and sufferings still remain untranscended? Blessing and wisdom are seas of desire for riches and honour; the ancient sages said: “The river of love is a thousand feet of waves, the sea of desire is ten thousand layers of billows.” One must wait until the water dries and the waves end, until the nature source is clear. You must understand the men of ancient and modern times; which is not of this nature source, born of womb and egg, moist and transformed, without awareness? To realize that this thing and I share one source is to repay heaven; life after life without ceasing, vast compassion, enduring filth and humiliation. Who is not of this qi and spirit, flying, diving, moving, growing of plants and beasts, dependent on it for nurture? This is repaying the earth. The nature-ground is bright; the innate heaven is round and clear. Encountering those darkened, speak true words to open them, pointing out the lost path; meeting those sunk in confusion, give teachings to deliver life, removing obstacles. This is repaying sun, moon, and day. Carefully follow the master’s instructions, strictly observe the laws of the land, reverently uphold the sovereign’s edicts; do not overstep your bounds, nor act contrary to virtue and right. Keep pure rules and observe the scriptures, pray for holy longevity and preserve the imperial vision. Pass on to later generations, illuminating the correct Way; this is repaying sovereign and teacher. The body is received from parents; hair and skin should not touch filth. Remove private selfishness; confess and extract the pain of the nether darkness. The past toil of parents bless and dissolve many karmic knots; the present hardship of kin repays vexing offenses. Only by fully repaying this form-body can one be without filial day’s end; without repaying parents, one does not ascend to reality. Reverence all others’ parents as one’s own; protect all children as like one’s own; so that the seven heavens rise, the three generations are highly exalted; this is repaying parents.

Beloved assembly, if your heart has the slightest obstacle, how can you see the Supreme Pure Ones of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Elders and Seven Worthies? You now constantly divide self and other, habitually producing ignorance. Your mind is narrow; you cannot endure one thing. Your capacity is shallow; you cannot accommodate one person. You do not examine origins; you err in right and wrong. In honour you rejoice; in disgrace you rage. Your resolve is not firm and deep; your thoughts are not bright. Your heart has no tolerance; your body is often lax. You regard small faults as nothing; you rely on your little gains. How then can you repay heaven and earth, sovereign and teacher, kin and clan?

Beloved assembly, to repay heaven and earth’s kindness you must understand the Way of heaven and earth, embody the heart of heaven and earth, penetrate the principle of heaven and earth, and attain the virtue of heaven and earth. In a dark room deceive not; all false feelings must be cut off. Let the light of wisdom shine everywhere; all manner of filth can indeed be borne. Suffer losses and accept losses without one grain of self; endure pains and bear pains, cutting off all thieving hearts. With real effort, the realm is bright and clear. With weighty virtue and lofty Way, spirits and demons admire. Spirit clear, wisdom arising, things transform and men return. Above, one may move the throne of the Emperor; below, command thunder and lightning. In drought, pray for rain to moisten the living; in flood, pray for clear skies to dispel water disasters. Evil spirits hide and flee; goblins and monsters are driven away. Above, pray for the golden fortress to be enduring, for holy longevity without limit; below, pray for songs and dances throughout the land, for all the people to enjoy their labors. This is truly to explain the ancestral customs and promote the Way’s transformation. Moreover, our parents nurtured us, carrying us for ten months, suckling us for three years, enduring myriad hardships, their kindness deep and boundless. When grown, we hope to care for them in their old age and see them to their end, bringing glory to the family gates. The sovereign rises early and rests late; the six departments and nine ministers divide and communicate the law; they remove the wicked and comfort the good; restrain evil and stop wrong; honour the worthy and esteem virtue. The teacher deafens the deaf and opens the blind; the earth follows heaven’s laws; the three bonds are clarified; the five constants fully known; discern good and evil; distinguish men from beasts; is virtue shallow or rare? You, now at home, do not properly care for your parents; in office, you cannot promote the state’s plans. Your clothing depends on the thousand gates’ alms; your food depends on the ten thousand fields’ cultivation. You but follow waves and currents, all day drifting in confusion, wandering and roaming, mumbling words, not cultivating virtue; not abiding by precepts. When moved, you break rules; your spirit is dim and mind scattered. When you ascend the altar to pray for the state, spirits do not descend; when you drive away demons and clear plague, sicknesses do not heal; your talismans and rites have no power; your prayers and exorcisms are in vain. The lowest among you, meeting ghosts or floods, only have scolding winds and raining curses, blaming earth and resenting heaven, wandering wildly; even rebelling against kin and defying clan, breaking rules and raging at others. Beloved assembly, you see oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, dogs, swine—all have the five senses and six eyes, yin and yang, male and female, perception and spirit; only nowadays they can still speak this one mouthful. Ah!

At that time the preceptor again gave a gatha:  
“Cultivate samadhi and wisdom, keep the precepts pure;  
Heaven and earth, hells and heavens, all become clear.  
Not a thread of attachment, light ever bright;  
Ten thousand burdens erased, heart thus cleansed.  
Fate given by heaven, unchanging;  
To finish birth and death, sincerity is key.  
Side paths and strange ways manifold;  
Universally urge all to awaken to truth.  
Four kindnesses unrepayed bring shame;  
Three karma still remain, the Way not made.  
To repay four kindnesses, first keep precepts;  
To remove three karma, fully cultivate truth.  
Keeping precepts naturally walks the right way;  
Cultivating truth ultimately realizes floating life.  
Floating life once realized, impermanence shines through;  
Three karma empty, repay four kindnesses.  
Avoid the world, leave home, seek to transcend dust;  
Greed, anger, and ignorance are all hard to clear.  
When all passions end, the heart is pure;  
Nature’s light clear, the Way draws near.  
See through the color-body—who is real?  
Observe all things—who is immortal?  
Not a thread of attachment, three minds ended;  
Ten precepts complete, freely walk.”
