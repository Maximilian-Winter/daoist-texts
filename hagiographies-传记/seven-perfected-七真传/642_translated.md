# Wisdom and Radiance

Sons of the Way, ye have received the three hundred great precepts of the Central Pole, and practise secret conduct and subtle demeanour, yet cannot compare with the original precepts of the Primordial Truth of former days. These rules are subtle and profound, their essence lies in exertion upon the heart-mind itself. Whenever a thought or motion arises, ye must maintain sincerity, reverence, and in secret examine and scrutinize, with great uprightness and rectitude. Sweep clean and pure the thoughts within the heart-mind, as the azure sky with bright moon, without the least cloud or shadow; as crystal and glass, without the smallest flaw or blemish; as the boundless mirror, without a single speck of dust or stain; as the nocturnal pearl, without a trace of obscurity or darkness. When round, firm, steady, and radiant thus, then may the Way be discoursed upon.

Wisdom and radiance, the true emptiness and wondrous aspect, originally arise from precept and meditation. By enduring insult and cutting off obstacles, with strict and precise precepts, self-mastery and refinement, aided by the medicine of the Dharma, one may attain to this. Yet those who hold the precepts, few can keep and observe them; their practice is subtle and severe, but they deceive and delude themselves, a thousand-fold unable to cease. Why so? Ah, sons of the Way, if practice be not secret and exact, it is called the cause of defilement; how then can ye attain the fruit of non-action?

These four words, Wisdom and Radiance, are of the highest and most excellent faculty. Therefore the lower and inferior faculties cannot penetrate their meaning. Only by undivided will, by concentrating spirit and vital points, fostering ancestral breath, nurturing the innate nature, reaching the utmost of emptiness, preserving silent steadfastness, pure and one without duality, with spirit concealed without limit, at the utmost the Great Ultimate, naturally springs forth wisdom and radiance; with the return of Yang, then is the original visage revealed. To know the nature of ghosts and spirits, to understand the pivot of creation, is called intelligence; to participate in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, to share the brightness of sun and moon, and the interchange of the four seasons, is called wisdom; to universally manifest the Dharma-body and encompass the Dharma-realm, not departing from enlightenment and illumination, all returning to brightness and clarity, is called radiance; to penetrate all things in formlessness, to see all matters in their unmanifested signs, traversing empty space without trace, soaring beyond sun and moon without shadow, is called clarity.

If the precepts be not strictly observed, then one cannot be calmly established. Without calm establishment, wisdom will not be born. Without wisdom born, radiance will not appear. The Jewel Pivot Treasure Scripture, one scroll, treats solely of the original nature, directly pointing to the human mind; the nature’s truth is manifest, the heavenly secrets fully revealed, causing beings to turn the wheel and awaken to the Way. Alas! Many are bewildered, few awaken. The mouth may recite, but the heart cannot hold; the heart though sincere, the strength cannot transform. Woe is it to disappoint the holy mind, to point only to the Dharma treasure in vain. Now I must on behalf of the Scripture declare the wonder, point to the true mechanism, that ye sons of the Way may be enlightened and enter understanding. Each of you be reverent, with a devoted heart, listen carefully.

The Scripture says, “In the thousand five hundred kalpas of old, my mind met this Way, and so I attained the Primordial Truth; my thought brewed this work, and so I wielded great transformation.” Again it says, “With a clear and tranquil heart, I make a great vow; with the power of wisdom, I subdue all demons.” Again it says, “Ye heavenly beings desire to hear the supreme Way. The supreme Way is deep and obscure, not in other things. Since ye desire to hear, it is that which is without interval. Without interval and without sight, that is the true Way. Hearing and sight also vanish; only ye remain. Ye are not yet existence, how much less the Way? To hear without hearing, what Way can be spoken of?” Again it says, “The Way is entered by sincerity, preserved by silence, used by softness. Use sincerity as if foolish, use silence as if dumb, use softness as if clumsy. Thus may one forget form, forget self, forget forgetfulness. The entrant to the Way knows stopping, the preserver of the Way knows cautiousness, the user of the Way knows subtlety. Knowing subtlety produces the light of wisdom; knowing cautiousness perfects holy intelligence; knowing stopping brings calm establishment and peace. With calm establishment and peace, holy intelligence is perfected; with holy intelligence perfected, the light of wisdom is born; with wisdom born, one is one with the Way. This is called true forgetting. Only through forgetting without forgetting — forgetting what cannot be forgotten — is the supreme Way. The Way is in Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth know it not; there is feeling and non-feeling, only one, not two.” Again it says, “Those who attain awakening shall rise to the celestial seat.” Again it says, “Fools may become wise, turbid may become clear, all by destiny’s command. Fools are dim and turbid, and so are the winds and soils which they receive and change. Heaven and Earth divine its mechanism, so that man knows it not, and this is called Nature. To know that one knows not is also called Nature. The wonder of Nature, though wondrous to knowing, its wondrousness lies in not knowing. Yet in the Way, there is never folly nor turbidity.” Again it says, “What has been proclaimed, the highest men who receive the Scripture, should all dig up gold and lay down silver, and by oath to Heaven transmit it.”

Sons of the Way, this is the true profound secret of the Jewel Pivot Scripture, the supreme and inconceivable, the treasure of pure quietude and liberation of the highest class and subtlety. Ye only know to recite the Scripture from dawn to dusk, but have not understood the wonderful purport within. If, when reciting and revering it, ye perceive the secret of the Scripture, then shall holy intelligence be perfected and wisdom light born. The supreme Way spoken of is deep and obscure, beyond seeing and hearing. Were it not that the Heavenly Honoured, a thousand five hundred kalpas ago, opened the heart of pure quietude, made great vows to save all beings, so that all might attain the utmost wonder—again it is said the origin is emptiness and non-being, without sound to be heard, without colour to be seen. Since there are no sounds to hear, then forget the ears; since there are no forms or colours to see, then forget the eyes. When ears and eyes are forgotten, then hearing and seeing may likewise vanish. Therefore ears and eyes have form and colour, being the leaders of the six roots; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are indeed the sources of the six roots. How can these accord with the Way? If one can clear the six appearances, sweep away the six consciousnesses, then one does not hear with the ears but hears with the heart; does not look with the eyes but sees with the spirit. Thus not hearing and yet hearing, not looking and yet seeing. Without hearing and without seeing, this accords with the Way.

The Red Script of the Cavernous Antiquity says, “Forget the eyes and light overflows without limit; forget the ears and the mind’s consciousness is ever deep. Forgetting both mechanisms, one enters the many wondrous gates. Seeing not the self, hearing not the sound, departing from all boundaries, this is called the wondrous Way.” The Nanhua Scripture says, “Qi stops at the ears, the mind stops at the sign.” Therefore the Jewel Pivot Scripture says, “Forget form and forget self, this is the mechanism of entering the Way. Again, enter by sincerity; this word sincerity is precept. Preserve by silence; this word silence is to hold precepts and subdue body and mind. Using silence as if dumb, this is entering meditation and forgetting ears and eyes. Using softness as if clumsy, this is wisdom hidden in secrecy.” Again it says, “If ye seek it within your own coloured body with hearing and seeing, ye shall never see it nor hear it.” The Diamond Scripture says, “If a man seeks me by form and colour, or by sound and voice, he walks the wrong Way, and cannot see the Tathāgata.”

He who desires to enter the Way must receive precepts and enter meditation, diligently cultivate wisdom, dispel confusion by light, and hear not and see not yet hear and see. Therefore the Way-entrant knows stopping; this is the power of holding precepts and checking thoughts; knows cautiousness; this is the power of careful solitude and eager advance; knows subtlety; this is the power of cutting off sages and abandoning wisdom. To stop thought is not possible without precepts; careful solitude is not possible without meditation; subtlety is not possible without wisdom. If truly able to hold precepts, enter meditation, and cultivate wisdom, then body and mind are calmly established, holy intelligence purely complete, wisdom light universally shines. When wisdom light shines forth, then is one one with the Way; this is called true forgetting. This true forgetting is not the mere sitting in vacancy and beating the void; it is true emptiness. Within this true emptiness is the wondrous aspect of purple gold, the wondrous fruit of emptiness that is not empty. Able not to fall into vain emptiness, emptiness yet not empty, then the wondrous secret naturally reveals itself. Only by forgetting what is to be forgotten, yet not forgetting, is the supreme and wondrous Way.

Again it says: Fool and wise differ; hence clear and turbid vary. Though all are bound to the wind and soil, receiving and changing unevenly, all are mechanisms of creation, divine movements of Nature, the principles of breath and fate, fixed at birth. Yet fools deem themselves fools, wise deem themselves wise; then what recompense have Heaven and Earth for the fool’s wisdom? Only by stirring the heart of pure quietude, establishing broad vows, desiring to leave the world and save others, must one hear the Way and save oneself. He who saves himself turns to the Three Treasures, receives precepts, enters meditation, cultivates wisdom and lets forth radiance; then fools may become wise, and turbidity may be purified. If one cannot hold precepts and enter meditation, wisdom remains blocked, no light can illuminate, then clarity may become turbidity, and wisdom may become folly. The Diamond Scripture says, “The Dharma I speak of has no fixed form.” This is the meaning.

The wisdom and radiance taught, bright and profound, illuminating the Dharma realm, how can it be other than the Jewel Pivot Treasure Scripture? The Jewel Pivot is the true mechanism. He who would turn the Scripture must first turn the true mechanism, and secretly cultivate blessing and wisdom. Only fearing that the light and radiance remain hidden, unable to open or be seen. How otherwise can one perceive the form of ghosts and spirits, grasp the pivot of creation, participate in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, steer the movements of sun and moon, encompass the Dharma realm within a grain of millet, fix matters at their unmanifest beginnings, be called master of the wondrous Way, and advance to the realm of celestial immortals? It is truly thus: he who sees the treasure of light and radiance can hear the root of the supreme Way. If not for the cultivation of precepts and meditation, how could the light of wisdom be deep? Clinging to appearances is not the true aspect; forgetting hearing and seeing is the beginning of hearing. Hear, think, and cultivate the wondrous, freely as the sound of ocean tides.
