# The Marvelous Function of Spiritual Penetration

The various Masters, in the foregoing treatise, have discoursed upon the Way of Wisdom and Brightness; but the *Jade Pivot Classic* employs hearing and seeing only to their extinction. When there is neither hearing nor seeing, then indeed the wondrous function is fully declared, and the spiritual penetration appears. The Masters say, the *Yin Conjuration Classic* declares: 'The deaf see what they see; the blind see what they hear.' The ancient Immortals say: 'At rest, one hears not the thunder; in familiarity with vision, one sees not Mount Tai.' The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: 'The virtue of ghosts and spirits is exceedingly great! They look and see not; they listen and hear not.' The *Nanhua Classic* says: 'Without seeing or hearing, embracing the spirit in stillness.' The *Treatise on the Unity of the Three* says: 'The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth, when closed and obstructed, do not send forth communication; the true man abides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the rule within.' 

In the Scriptures and Books, the wondrous sayings cannot be fully set forth. The Great Being Avalokiteśvara, through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation, enters the samādhi.

The root of the ear is the orifice through which essence is discharged, not the essence of the afterborn, floating desires, but the qi of the primordial Taiyi containing the true, the essence of genuine response and manifestation. If one listens inwardly and blocks its cleverness, then the essence does not fly away, and wisdom is born. The eye is the orifice through which spirit is discharged, not the spirit of afterborn thoughts and cares, but the innate wondrous aspect, spiritual perception, and good consciousness; the primordial spirit arising in the great subtle ether. If one looks inwardly and returns its brightness, then one does not wander without, and intelligence is born. He who can maintain precepts and enter into concentration, then wisdom is born. When wisdom is born, water and fire intermingle. When water and fire intermingle, Kan and Li meet. When Kan and Li meet, Heaven and Earth are in harmony. When Heaven and Earth are in harmony, metal and wood unite. When metal and wood unite, the soul and spirit join. When soul and spirit join, essence and qi transform. When essence and qi transform, spiritual penetration manifests. When spiritual penetration manifests, brightness shines forth. When brightness shines forth, merit and virtue are perfected. When merit and virtue are perfected, the Dharma body is established. When the Dharma body is established, the nature of the Way is displayed. When the nature of the Way is displayed, wondrous function is exercised. When wondrous function is exercised, all living beings are delivered. When all living beings are delivered, the power of vows is fulfilled. When the power of vows is fulfilled, great matters are completed. When great matters are completed, the position of fruit is attained. This alone is the One Vehicle Doctrine; the other two are not true. From beginning to end, it does not pass beyond one word, Sincerity.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: 'Without sincerity there is nothing.' The thing is indeed vague and obscure; yet within it there is a thing. Dim and dark, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is very true; within it there is faithfulness. Faithfulness is sincerity. This is what the *Book of Changes* calls essence and qi as the thing; the *Great Learning* calls the investigation of things the thing. Essence is the essence of unity in the *Book of Documents*. The Middle is the very centre of centres. The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'There is one treasure, secret in the Form Mountain; the sages wash the heart with this and retire to concealment in secrecy. All are none other than this thing. First they retire to concealment, and then see it.' The ancient song says: 'If one obtains this heart, there is not one thing; before the eyes is the time of Fu Yi.' Why then need there be spiritual penetration and wondrous function? Why need there be wisdom and brightness? This spiritual penetration and wondrous function are the true man, guarding the path of precepts and demonstrating the Law in person, to deliver sentient beings, and to draw the false back to the true in wondrous function. Therefore, in the midst of great wisdom and brightness, there is the bestowal of the golden arm, rescuing all beings, delivering them from suffering and entering into quietude. It can cause the mission of all beings to be prolonged in life; it can change disaster and sorrow into peace and joy. It causes lands and countries to be pure and peaceful, all attaining lengthened life and preservation of life. It causes beings to be pure, good, and upright, removing demons and evil spirits, driving out the violent and rebellious, exterminating devils and monsters. It causes beings to be compassionate and benevolent, refraining from killing and harming living things. It can cause beings to preserve their fate through kalpas, dissipating grievances and knots. It can cause beings' darkness to break and brightness to manifest. It can cause all diseases to be healed, and lingering ailments to be altogether dispelled. It can cause those turning foolish to become wise, returning to correctness and abandoning evil. It can cause few desires and a clear heart, gathering the emotions and returning to nature. It can cause liberation without hindrance, surpassing the mundane and entering the holy. It can cause accumulation of blessing and removal of calamity, producing auspiciousness and abolishing guilt. It can cause transcendence of the world and attainment of the Way, leaving suffering and attaining truth. It can cause cultivation of the highest vehicle, ascending to heaven, universally leading sentient beings, spirit wandering to the eight extremes, surpassing the Heavenly Palace.

May all my living beings in their mortal bodies be made the Body of the Dharma King, and reach even to the inconceivable, called spiritual penetration. Not disclosing its mechanism to the world, it is called wondrous function. Therefore the spiritual penetration of the gate of precepts, concentration, and wisdom is the spirit that is not spirit, the transformation of the six senses into six penetrations, penetrating heaven and earth, penetrating spirits and ghosts, penetrating man and things — this is called spiritual penetration. This wondrous function has use without the wondrous, moving one mechanism and manifesting ten thousand directions and transformations. Transforming heavenly demons, transforming earth fiends, transforming ten thousand ghosts, transforming evil men, transforming monsters — called wondrous function. In the gate of precepts and concentration one enters stillness; concentration and wisdom generate brightness, which is the primordial one qi circle of bright auspicious aspect. Above it penetrates the Heavenly Palace, paying homage to the ancestral qi above the Three Pure Ones; below it penetrates the Earthly Prison, pardoning the guilty souls in the depths of the Nine Springs. When expounding the Law, the heavenly gods are subdued; the Five Emperors stand by the throne; myriads of gods attend and guard, ranked in order and adorned; they wish to hear the true Law and refine the spirit to return to emptiness. Having attained deliverance, with compassionate and merciful heart, saving the suffering and cold and hidden, then the pure net praises and exalts; Earth Store Bodhisattva opens the light; the ghost judge observes and obeys; the underworld is subdued, and the guilty pardoned and reborn; they hear the true Law, so as to escape the register of ghosts, and all turn to ultimate joy. Thus, self-deliverance and deliverance of others arise; great vows are made; may all hear the supreme Way; that by the medicine of the Law all sentient beings be universally saved; then beings and even the moving and containing spirits are all released. Earth, wood, and tile rubble all attain sympathy and communication. All things and feelings are thoroughly penetrated. Moving spiritual penetration in unconsciousness, Heaven and Earth and all things are within my body; manifesting wondrous function naturally, mountains, rivers, stars, and constellations are gathered within the Dharma. The heavenly demons all reverently submit, bowing their heads and respectfully welcoming. The earth fiends all transform to kindness and harmony, their hearts reverent and awed. Fierce and cruel ghosts, hearing the transformation, ascend beyond, forever renouncing blood food. Asuras and heterodox paths serve the Law and return to correctness. Wars cease forever; wrongs are redressed; grievances and hatreds are dissolved. By virtue they are transformed, not by force subdued; thus the evil men all become good men; by sincerity they are moved, not by artifice overpowered; thus the evil men all change to upright men. Reversing and controlling the Dipper and turning Yin and Yang, deities and ghosts are unfathomable; overturning and applying the transformation mechanism to transcend the world, Heaven and Earth know it not. Universally manifesting the spirit and brightness, firmly establishing the Dharma body, yet without form to be seen. Broadly proclaiming the supreme vehicle, the one wondrous Law, yet without sound to be heard. The void is my Dharma realm; I am the Dharma body of the void. Confused and turbid, united as one body with Heaven; upright and great, one mind with Immortals and Buddhas. Chengzi says: 'When released it fills the six realms; when rolled up it retreats and conceals itself in secrecy.' This is what is meant. The so-called parents of beings, the masters of the Way — are they not the spiritual penetration of pure quietude and deliverance, the wondrous function of non-action and naturalness?

The Masters, if they do not attach to appearances, then their wisdom penetrates widely; if they follow the course of Heaven, then their wondrous function is without limit. It depends only on daily use, common and not slackened; in haste and urgency, not abandoned. The two characters Tao and virtue suffice. Why then forsake precepts and rules to study talismans and arts; abandon jade tablets to love baubles? Will you then be content to be a fool, and not learn the Way of the highest vehicle?

Ah! Masters entering the profound gate should seek the highest vehicle. Everyone contains wondrous apertures; each is bright and luminous. They are obstructed only by many hindrances, and rely on the precepts which are but empty words. Even if one holds many times with interruptions, wandering and not deep in concentration. When concentration is deep and precepts and vows are earnest, neither aiding nor forgetting is the measure. Throughout the two six-hour periods of the day, at every moment hold fast, for three years or five without loss or opposition. When concentration and precepts are familiar, spiritual penetration comes of itself; spirit itself penetrates and wondrous function is true. Move spiritual penetration, attain wondrous function; Masters must rely on advancing sincerity. If foolishly and blindly attached to appearances in seeking, the life of a ghost in its den is not the right path. Heterodox and side doors mostly dwell on form; attachment to emptiness and form are also not cultivation. Attach not to emptiness, attach not to form; in concentration there is no form, in feeling there is penetration. In use, there is spiritual brightness; the spirit distinguishes itself. How many Way seekers lose the central功. I now am not much given to loquacity. Ah! Simply disclose the heavenly mechanism. Spiritual penetration manifests; wondrous function appears; throughout earth and sky the great Dharma King. Not passing beyond constant stillness, true constant Way; heterodox teachings return their hearts; evil turns to good. Disobedience is at once transformed to filial piety and brotherly love; the stubborn and cruel all become kind and gentle. Wisdom is like a mirror; intelligence like a spirit; one bright spiritual platform shining clearly. The six penetrations mutually used leave no trace of dust; all earth, mountains, and rivers are pure gold. Masters, do not be lax or lightly hold the precepts; this is the heavenly ladder, step by step ascending. Spirit is hard to fathom, wonder is hard to measure; do not depart from precepts, concentration, use, truth, and constancy. The gate of true thus has the hole that penetrates heaven; in the non-dual fasting, the sacred incense is emitted. Masters, cultivate sincerely and do not abandon yourselves; follow the ancient gods and immortals’ great Way place.
