# Perfection of Merit and Virtue

Gentlemen! The void is vast and boundless; within the gate of precept and meditation there is the ladder to ascend to Heaven. The sea of suffering is vast and boundless; within the light of wisdom there is the vessel to cross the ocean. If one does not set forth with firm steps, the journey of ninety thousand li is hard to reach. If one does not straighten the spine to proceed, the true law is hard to hear through a thousand and a hundred kalpas. Should one walk without carefulness and lack a steadfast will, how can merit be perfected and virtue fulfilled?

Gentlemen, do not let a single thought leak from your heart; the original breath within the body will naturally be full, complete, and harmonious. Virtue conquers ghosts and gods; only then can one escape the retribution of transmigration. The Way connects Heaven and Earth; only then can one be born beyond the path of life and death. Ascending high to the shore of the Way, a single turn is homecoming; delving deeply into mystery and obscurity, in the blink of an eye one returns to the original aspect.

Gentlemen! Who is there that does not die? Who has ever seen longevity? The undying is surely not the mortal body; the longevity is not concerned with form and substance. Where is Peng Zu today? Where is Yan Zi after ten thousand kalpas? The undying is my Dharma body; the longevity is my primordial breath. Even Tathāgata has a time of extinction, entering into the realm of Nirvāṇa; Lao Dan also has the day of ascension, transcending to the great red Heaven. The Way remains and man remains; the Law is present and the body is the same. To die without forgetfulness is longevity; a nameless name unbroken through myriad kalpas. To be born without possession is form; a formless form undiminished through hundreds of generations.

Countless sages as many as the sands of the Ganges, which one does not enter and exit through this mysterious gate? Innumerable immortals and Buddhas beyond reckoning, which one does not come and go along this great road? The clear and manifest heavenly way, yet alas, men are lost in doubt and disbelief. The pure and tranquil Buddha-land, yet alas, the obstacles of the common people are hard to remove. It is but that blessings are thin and sins deep; though they have eyes, they are less than the blind. Many men, owing to deep enmity and heavy karma, though alive, are accounted as dead. Flesh moves but the corpse walks; more than beasts only in speech and language. Sleeping by day and by night, less than plants, yet standing upright and stretching branches. One day, when the spirits come to summon, what care you if you are a perfect Daoist? Although not a word amiss, your case is examined; still you are adjudged a wicked man devoid of virtue.

Gentlemen! All men have death, but it is to die well that matters. Clean and pure, neat and spotless, coming and going freely without restraint. All men have dispersion, only that it be dispersed wisely. Clear and manifest, free and untroubled, transforming and perfectly penetrating without measure. Before turning back, take leave of the multitude. When the time has come, let go and proceed. Naked you appear as a babe, at your crown a vast vapour of auspicious light in myriad rays; round and complete you ascend with wondrous form, among half the heaven the coloured clouds and white cranes soar high. Many immortal scenes, the primordial spirit returns to purity and void; a single stream of auspicious light, true bones hidden in a grotto. The great man, his work accomplished! Leaving an immortal name in the world, transmitting a treatise of the Way among men. So that in hundreds and thousands of years hence, men will know that such a one existed. This is to die and not perish; this is longevity. So that after myriad kalpas the Way is passed on, this is the great perfection, great merit, and great reward-body.

Gentlemen, nature and life are in yourselves; to tell others is forbidden. If you do not cultivate yourselves, you cannot cultivate for another. Thoughts arise and perish; you cannot grasp them. Delusive thoughts and private desires; you cannot sweep them away. Attachments deep and heavy; you cannot relinquish them. The Dharma-body is formless; you cannot recognise it. Precepts and rules; you cannot keep them. Afflictions and ignorance; you cannot dispel them. Worldly dust and habits; you cannot dissolve them. Many obstacles; you cannot remove them. True words and wondrous Dharma; you cannot rely on them. Karma and retribution; you cannot believe them. Mortal mind and worldly state; you cannot forget them. Wishes for form; you cannot empty them. Heterodox and outside ways; you cannot discern them. Conditioned illusions; you cannot penetrate them. Things and matters; you cannot respond to them. States and realms; you cannot transcend them. Perfect men and enlightened teachers; you cannot seek them. The vast Way of void; you cannot enter it. All beings in this life; you cannot save them. Original mind and vow-power; you cannot complete them.

Gentlemen, why is this? It is only because you preceptors are proud and arrogant, transformation does not come to you. Kind words and good speech, you do not receive. Doubt or disbelief, you do not examine. Heavy sins and deep offenses, you cannot be delivered. Anger, wrath, and slander, you will not cease. Joy and flattery, you will resist. Base nature and violent anger, you will oppose. Crafty plots and subtle calculations, you will abandon. Faithful and bitter words, you will not enter. Ignorance and folly, you will not break. Blind and sightless, you will not be enlightened. Arrogance and disorder, you will not be restrained. Disease and suffering, you cannot be healed. Fate and calamity, you cannot be pardoned. In the numbers and kalpas, you will not be spared. Retribution and consequence, you will not be released. Royal law and secret punishments, you cannot evade. Mountains of knives and trees of swords, you cannot look back. Benevolent ferry and wise raft, you cannot be crossed. Golden elixir and wondrous treasure, you cannot be entrusted. Though there be heavenly secrets, you cannot turn them. Though there be divine powers, you cannot pass them.

Gentlemen, you must truly bear a bitter resolve and bitter practice, guard the precepts without violation. In meditation seek unity; one sincerity, not two; then truly turning the heart towards the Way. Gentlemen, turning the heart towards the Way, repentance is naturally cleansed. Returning to the great Way, entanglements are naturally severed. The mysterious gate of Heaven, pure void is naturally approached. The darkness of the nether world, light naturally opens. Great disasters and calamities, transmigration is naturally escaped. Life and death are impermanent, the handle is firmly grasped. The boundless great Way, hearts naturally unite. The supreme Dharma-body, clarity is naturally attained. Infinite blessings and rewards, naturally peacefully received. Countless beings, one by one can be saved. Great vows and solemn aspirations, deep and profound are naturally fulfilled. As enduring as earth and Heaven, longevity is naturally equally attained. Only require a clear heart, barriers naturally are passed. Only require sincerity, hard as metal and stone, naturally are penetrated. Only require a humble heart, not a trace can stain it.

Only require a clear and tranquil heart, boundlessness can be lodged, naturally great perfection.

Gentlemen, now I have finished expounding the Dharma; the Daoist ground is complete. I only think of you, father and son ascending the mountain, the father cannot transmit it to the son, the son cannot replace the father, fellow travellers cultivating, the cold and warmth each man knows for himself, advancement and retreat each man comes to by himself. Therefore, to preach the Dharma, there is not a single method; it is only to diagnose the illness, prescribe according to symptoms, and apply medicine accordingly. When the illness is cured and symptoms removed, there is no further need for prescription or medicine. Just as to cross a river one must use boat and ship, once upon the shore, one should no longer think of the boat. Just as needle draws thread, when the garment is sewn, there is no further need for needle and thread. Do not paint a snake and add feet, or pull grass seeking snakes. Only each and all strive forward, honestly and faithfully hold the precepts closely. Within the precepts forget the precepts; outside the rules add rules; with skill deep and the fire at its due time, one will naturally be raised by the Patriarch, led and connected with the True. You must not be without resolve, relying on the master, depending on fellow Daoists, clinging to name and form, blindly following others day and night and year after year. You must fix your heart firmly; engender no doubt; with one mind and one intention, die without regret. When the time of fire is complete, have you not heard that the Sovereign Heaven does not disappoint the earnest heart? The great Way is silent and unmoving; a man who can respond to it thereby attains passage.

Gentlemen, if you are willing to make the fierce heart, to proceed straight forward without looking back, to yearn without turning away, you may be said to have high and far-reaching aspiration; this is the seed of the Way. The Ancestor Qiu left a silent verse, not lightly shown to the multitude. Now I recount it to you; listen carefully and receive it. The verse says:  
'Life and death are impermanent; you must awaken yourself.  
To die, be your own, and no other will care.  
Do not depend on others; even gods and immortals save themselves.  
Not just the six senses and six consciousnesses,  
Nor depending on one Dharma, the mind abides evermore.  
Evermore abiding, impermanent abiding,  
Know the cause without obscuring the countless causes.  
By cause and place discern the brightness of self-nature’s emptiness,  
Who dwells in the fruit’s realization of emptiness?  
From now on, have done with the mechanism of life and death;  
From this time, erase the roll of transmigration.  
If one observes the precepts and seeks conduct,  
The heavenly gods will secretly be aware.  
The Dragon Gate’s mind-method has no original Dharma;  
Bitter words and straight talk expound but one section.  
No need to cling to the law or seek to remove it;  
Thus the verse’s true place is seen.  
Carefully study my words expounding the Dharma-body;  
Void is indeed the treasure house of many jewels.  
When stirred, thoughts arise in boundless measure;  
The Tao is stored within the body, extending blessings and happiness.  
The mind-method harmonizes, Dharma is the mind;  
The Dharma-mind is without end, long and wide the crossing.'
