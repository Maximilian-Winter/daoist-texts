# Chapter Twenty-two: Contemplation and Realization of the Primordial Mechanism

Sons and disciples, this point of emptiness and spirit unclouded, is none other than the Perfected of Primordial Life. Is it a matter easily to be seen?

From antiquity to the present, the sages, worthies, immortals, Buddhas, and ancestral perfected ones, have sat facing the wall for nine years, seated in the circle for six; in threes and sevens, they have diligently sought. They have traversed famous mountains, wandered the blessed lands, sought teachers and visited friends, inquired of the Way and listened to the scriptures, undergone bitter disciplines and profound labors, bestowed gifts and accumulated merit. All manner of practice is but for this body’s birth and death, its nature and life; great matters of cause and condition, with no knowledge whence coming or whither going; wandering and sinking, difficult to escape the wheel of rebirth. Therefore, they have set forth vows, established merits and conduct. Some, by cutting off thought and forgetting passion, seek the method for transcending the world; then sit in meditation for three or five years, breaking countless cushions, rarely utterly ceasing thought, or forgetting passion even for half a moment; yet in the end return from two five to ten. Others, by refining lead and melting mercury, seek the method for transcending the world, performing their labors from dawn to dusk, withdrawing talismans and advancing fire; how often have they seen the jade liquid sevenfold returned, the golden liquid ninefold refined, catching the thief only to release him again! Others, by preserving thought and contemplation, silently facing the Supreme Emperor for three days; others, by refining and ferrying the obscure, uplifting the shades in the nine realms; others, by calling spirits and summoning generals, wearing talismans to call themselves Perfected; others, by raising Qi and opening the gate, moving essence and breath to extol the wondrous Way; others, by chanting scriptures and devoutly worshipping; others, by compounding elixirs to heal sickness and cure sores; others, by refining food and drugs in hopes of ascent; others, by imitating yin and yang in their movements and postures; others, by breathing in gourds and flutes within cauldrons, using spirit to move true lead to extend life and receive fate; others, by adding and drawing fire and sand within the furnace, refining grass roots and establishing merit and charity; others, by bodily suffering, embracing the Way of the Golden Elixir while awaiting transmission to the fortunate; others, by shallow cause and condition, attempting difficult practices and letting go at the cliff’s edge. All these delusions of self-nature, as phantom practices, are but side doors.

Sons and disciples, to cut off thought and forget passion, one must seek to realize where thought arises, whence passion comes; to grasp firmly, hasten with steadiness, recognize the true, and point to the real — only then can one set about cutting off and forgetting. But I ask you, this grasping, catching, recognizing, pointing, setting to work, cutting off food, forgetting passion — what is it? No matter how you cut off thought and forget passion, though your cushions be broken, thought remains thought, passion remains passion. The masses call cutting off thought “resting the head upon the head”; forgetting passion is called “catch the thief and release the thief.” Better indeed to forget even this forgetting of passion, to cut off even the cutting-off of thought; to forget both mechanisms, enter the myriad wondrous gates — this is the superior principle. Sons and disciples, when I say to cut off thought, know that the cutting off itself is the thought; when I say to forget passion, know that the forgetting itself is the seed of passion. The masses cutting off thought is not as good as thought cutting off itself; forgetting passion is not as good as passion forgetting itself; this is called seeking others, not seeking oneself.

Sons and disciples, those who refine lead and melt mercury, who draw and add fire’s degree, who imitate the hexagrams and lines, rend asunder the Great Ultimate of undivided origin. They take false names for real uses, point to similes and call them practice. They talk vainly of the three fields, blindly guess essence and breath, the seven feelings’ machinery, the nine orifices’ pivot. They take the characters seven and nine, the characters return and revert, as seven times nine, seven returns nine returns, seven stages nine stages, seven years nine years, seven transformations nine transformations. This drawing, that shaping. Upright the spine, the mud pellet, the tail gate, the cinnabar field, the scarlet chamber, the yellow court, the flower pool; water rises and fire descends, warming and bathing, sealing and fixing — today it is the union of Kan and Li, tomorrow the earth and heaven in peace, the day after the union of soul and spirit; this year still a babe, next year still a babe, come nine years, still an old sinner who knows not death. He does not know his own error, yet shakes his head and bends his finger, babbling to outsiders: “I conceived the holy embryo on such and such a day, warmed and nourished with no fault, bathing in season with no error; why after ten months’ gestation is there no birth of babe? Is it that your fortunes are thin and sins deep, and spirits will not permit accomplishment?” He still cups his belly, his face aged, eyes peering, tears dropping empty. Know then this base and ignorant man, who does not know his own heart, who does not discern his nature, blinded by karmic debts, what reason he knows. Know this man is still one who has intention to ascend, but is confused, not awakened to opportunity for ascent.

You have essence and breath within your body, originally innate primordial breath and primordial essence, a treasure neither increased nor diminished. If you stir it, you see no addition; if you do not stir it, you see no diminution. This emptiness and spirit unclouded true essence is the Primordial Spirit. Since it is called Primordial Spirit, then what is this babe? Before many kalpas, with sins unexpiated, obstacles not removed, heart source impure, nature root not awakened. If one does not early repent faults and transgressions, change one’s temperament, seek teachers and realize the Way, one turns the useful true heart into useless false affairs, and wastes the limited time in waiting for this shadowless babe — why so?

Sons and disciples, knowing good and evil within oneself, knowing yes and no, knowing right and wrong, knowing life and death, knowing self and other, knowing true and false — this is the babe. But this babe originally knows not good and evil, yes and no, right and wrong, life and death, self and other, true and false. This babe does not cling to forms; from conditions arises mind; from mind arises intelligence; from intelligence arises knowledge; from good comes knowledge of evil; from is comes knowledge of no; from right comes knowledge of wrong; from birth comes knowledge of death; from self comes knowledge of other; from right comes knowledge of falsehood. Originally no self-form, and no empty form; it is but this point in the world of perception and movement responding to myriad things. If one speak of the Great Ultimate of undivided origin, then this knowledge may be without knowledge. But this knowledge is good knowledge; in Buddhism called good friend of knowledge; in the Dao called babe Primordial Spirit. In sum, the masses are but one point of emptiness and spirit unclouded, the nature and substance.

You only see the Daoist enter the circle sitting in meditation, speaking of conception, entering the chamber for ten months; have you ever seen one manifest a babe, display form and emit light? Such a man before entering the circle knows not heaven and earth, spirits and yin and yang, human misfortune and blessing, future good and ill, birth year and death day. Upon leaving the circle, he remains as before ignorant. Ignorant of his own birth and death, unable to save himself, how can he save others? His own life and death unclear, good and ill not divined, fettered by heaven and earth, born no different from common men, dead no different from the vulgar; born sharing their food and pain, dead sharing their burial and stench — is not such circle sitting but trouble?

Sons and disciples, one must first die and forget the heart, then enter the circle; first abandon love and ties, then sit in meditation. When lustful mind ceases long, then the kidneys are full and true lead ascends; when angry mind ceases long, then the heart empties and true mercury descends; when food and drink are regulated in accord with season, then the spleen is strong and mercury and lead sealed. When passion is void, then the lungs moisten and nature settles; then liver flourishes and kidney water is abundant; then the eyes are bright and pupils like lacquer. When heart fire is extinguished, then the mouth is full of saliva and taste is sweet as honey. When soul is clear, liver Qi flows smoothly and sinews and bones are light; when spirit is calm, lung fluid circulates and beard and hair are black. When spleen is strong and stomach harmonious, tongue and throat are clear and voice resonant. When orifices open and blood full, all disease recedes; when five tastes are bland, right Qi arises. By observing four seasons and eight festivals, with guidance and exercise, wind, cold, heat, and damp cannot invade. By restraining six desires and seven emotions, and controlling nature and calming heart, demons, evil spirits, and goblins cannot offend. Seeking the great Way, the good heart appears and true nature shines; when the child awakens to true thusness, the colour body is empty and the Dharma body appears. Saving self and then saving others is still saving the self.

Sons and disciples, reaching this stage, it is but the first step entering the great gate. Then entering the circle sitting in stillness, one may communicate with heaven above and penetrate earth below; the states of spirits and gods, the pivot of heaven and earth, are no more than breath within the breath, creation no more than within the palm. All this comes from discipline and concentration. When entering the circle, one is mortal and ordinary bone; when leaving the circle, one is holy body and Dharma body. Clarifying the great Way, the vision is high, seeing all conditions as phantoms and falsehoods; with a staff in hand, the chest is broad, encompassing heaven and earth and entering emptiness. Before the human heart moves, I know; before events arise, I foresee. This is called the six penetrations, wisdom without end; all demons and spirits bow down and protect in darkness. The ten directions’ heretics turn and take refuge, all trembling with awe. In a mustard seed, Mount Sumeru is contained without notice; in a grain of millet, the ten directions’ worlds are hidden unknown. When released, the great earth and rivers are my free roaming; when concealed, the body is but dust and grain at my command.

Sons and disciples, this upward non-action of the utmost true wondrous Way, first lies in contemplating subtle principle and realizing heavenly mechanism. Therefore you must cast aside blind practice and blind sitting, refining lead and melting mercury, preserving thought and contemplation, refining and ferrying the obscure, taking office and receiving records, raising Qi and waving fans, chanting scriptures and reciting admonitions, compounding medicine and burning grass, taking food and gathering herbs, yin and yang furnaces and cauldrons — all these many useless matters need not be hurried, but all laid aside. Sincerely and earnestly make vows to heaven. From today and in the future, only wish early to understand the mechanism of birth and death, coming and going; to free yourself from the suffering of the wheel of birth and death; to leave various edges and borders; to attain to hear the wondrous Way. Ah! These words “to leave various edges” — truly for you is the great convenient gate of contemplating subtle principle and realizing heavenly mechanism.

Sons and disciples, what are these various edges? They are blind practice and blind sitting, refining lead and melting mercury, all manner of side doors. What are edges? These side doors are neither center nor right; like a table, these side doors are on the four edges, cannot enter the heart; even if reaching the heart, do not leave the table; not knowing that leaving the table is the emptiness and great Way; not leaving the table remains thing, not Way — is it not edge? Edge is seeking, error, boundary, bank. Side is not center, error is not right. With boundary, one cannot be vast; with bank and cliff, one cannot be clear and vast. Clinging tightly to this flesh bag, taking it for thousand-year-old cypress, ten-thousand-generation green pine, truly traps and kills the master. Instead of abandoning lamp to seek fire, clinging to false and discarding true — is it not falling to one side? Even if success, it is only self-completion. Not seeing nature, though having fruit position, after debt repaid returns to wheel of rebirth; difficult to transcend the three realms; what profit is this to living beings?

Sons and disciples, to become immortal or Buddha, to be sage or worth, all lies in abandoning self and following others, to save living beings, to set forth vast vows. Now those who sit in meditation cannot even save themselves; how can they save others? Called self-completers, how often have they truly understood the great Way, saved countless people? Falling to side practice, truly lamentable! The Perfected speaks verses, revealing the true mechanism, teaching the masses to abandon selfish heart, and also abandon side methods, so that side doors return to the center and act rightly, so that evil teaching turns against right Dharma and enters. Opening finite boundaries wide without obstruction or veil; expanding the great world to reach heaven and earth; widening banks and ditches until boundless and edge-less; extending the unfathomable Dharma body to no-one and no-self. The scripture says: "Seeing not myself, hearing not myself, leaving various edges — this is called the wondrous Way."

The masses, to open the gate of realization, must first open the heart. Whence comes life? Whither goes death? Approach the wise and eminent teachers, the truly sincere friends of wisdom. Broadly store good heart, examine in detail. In life like a cup of tea, confined by form and image, the water already flavoured. Poured into the Eastern Ocean, it scatters in mighty waves and floods. If one seeks the root source of the self, adding tea flavour and calling it water, then there are colours and forms. Yet finally within this ocean lies the root source of self; which then is the root source of self? Search carefully and thoroughly, until seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing. After long accumulated merit, naturally the chest clears in a single morning, the vision grounds itself serene; seeing one’s original face and wondrous heavenly mechanism, this one point of true nature then believes the great Way, and does not disappoint.

Sons and disciples, sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas have long since attained the Way and ascended to heaven. To see the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas, first understand their principle. To understand their principle is to realize their method; to realize their method is to carry out their deeds. To carry out their deeds is to be their body. Sons and disciples, where is the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas? Only within the individual’s square inch of heart. Where is their principle? Only before each person’s eyes. Where is their method? Only in the collected scriptures and histories. Where are their deeds? Not outside world-transcending methods; only within worldly methods. Where is their body? Again in the center of heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas. If one knows the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas in the square inch within, then one can understand their principle. If one understands their principle, one can realize their method. If one realizes their method, one can carry out their deeds. If one understands their principle, then the right Way is preserved. If one realizes their method, then all conditions awaken. If one carries out their deeds, then merit and deeds stand firm. And heavenly mechanism never ceases, ten thousand kalpas ever enduring. Know then, this person’s divine penetration and wisdom already possess the body of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas; this is the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas. Then advance to receive the middle supreme precepts, open and clarify nature and spirit, so that the mysterious gate is clear; then one can understand the principle of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas. Then advance to receive heavenly immortal precepts, refine subtle meanings, so that wisdom is fully thorough; then one can penetrate the Way of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas. Then one is liberated without hindrance, able to be round or square, great or small, moving or resting, advancing or retreating, born or dying, bending or stretching, going out or coming in, sage or worth, immortal or Buddha; able to be the four births, the six paths, the heavens, or hell. Teaching according to place, saving through kalpas, transformations beyond measure, manifesting body and speaking the Law. Like a boundless bright mirror returning and illuminating all forms and shadows, mutually containing one another. Then one can carry out the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas; become their body; attain their fruit!

The masses, at this stage, it is called contemplating subtle principle and realizing heavenly mechanism. In former days the Yellow Emperor left his mysterious pearl in the Red Water, so he sent Li Zhusu to seek it; Li Zhusu could not find it; then he sent Qi Gou Suo to seek it; Qi Gou Suo could not find it; then he sent Wang Xiang, who found it. That Li Zhu is the Li Gong Red colour, the after-heaven flesh lump heart of man; therefore it cannot be sought, an allegory of today’s mind clinging to the edge of usage. That Qi Gou is man’s love and attachment, pure mouth and body, relying on fasting; this heart is pure yet cannot be found. As to Wang Xiang, how could he find it? Sons and disciples! Wang means non-being; Xiang means form and colour. Wang Xiang means no form and no colour. Therefore it is not called bright pearl, but mysterious pearl. Even the most sage ancient teacher Confucius said: “That which is above form is called the Way; that which is below form is called the vessel.” The Supreme Old Ancestor said: “Look inside at the heart; the heart has no heart; look outside at form; form has no form.” Sons and disciples, the ultimate principle is the original true aspect. Sages and sages, worthies and worthies, immortals and immortals, Buddhas and Buddhas, all practice without attachment to form. If one were attached to form in practice, then the Yellow Emperor by wisdom would have fasted and sought the mysterious pearl. Sons and disciples! The Yellow Emperor lost the mysterious pearl, obtained it from non-being; common people obtain wondrous principle from the mindless masses. I have fully disclosed heavenly mechanism and revealed the seal of the heart. You all must carefully check and tightly guard that once the mysterious pearl in the Red Water is lost, you know not whither it returns!

Then the disciples of precepts all bowed and took refuge, listening to the verse:

“Ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures cannot exhaust it; one chapter directly points and leaves none behind. I urge you not to engage in many methods; the Way is in the heart, not in books. Attached to forms, contemplating mystery, deluded by many thoughts; with mind, sitting in meditation, sitting into a demon. Many evil paths men choose to walk; right Way has no one to oppose. The Perfected is formless and shapeless; one section of heavenly mechanism everywhere displayed. Do not look blindly here and there; do not abandon right path to enter side doors.”

At that time, Kunyangzi together with the masses dedicated merits, and disciple Shi Shouping compiled into a volume, presenting it for the lawyer’s inscription for later students. The lawyer said: “No need, you only need to have it passed down person to person; when read for 170 years, it will be fixed as the ‘Blue Garden Altar Scripture.’”
