# Appendix Two: Instructions Left by Patriarch Qiu

I instruct the later disciples and followers of my teaching to be well aware: ye who are men of enlightenment, having once entered the orthodox doctrine of the Mysterious Gate, your hearts are in communion with the good roots of former lives. One, to attest to the blessings and fruits of this present life; two, to cultivate so as not to fall in the calamities to come. If there be a sincere heart turning towards the Way, it must constantly observe the Supreme One’s laws. 

Yet how is it that the disciples are without self-awareness, seeking only to pass their lives by Daoist rites, ignorant of the esoteric teachings and their prohibitions? Even a grain of rice or a coin of bronze is all connected; these are the fat and oil of the world, the sweat and blood of the husbandmen. Without exertion, how can they be dispensed? Can they be received without merit? Ye are foolish and deluded, not examining yourselves, not willing to practice and hold to discipline; but rather saying the teaching brings no merit, and turning with intent towards the outer ways. 

Thus arise treachery, theft, and licentiousness, harming others and benefiting oneself. Some indulge in flesh and wine, gambling, destroying the teaching and ruining the sect; some burn thatch and refine mercury, deceiving and misleading people; some believe in and rely upon heterodox sects, slandering the orthodox teaching. Such unworthy and shameful acts—are these the works of the Daoist way? 

Moreover, do not say ye later learners can escape retribution. If heavenly spirits err, they are stripped of their rank; if earth gods err, they are demoted; if immortals err, they fall into dust; if ghosts and devils err, their traces are extinguished; if kings err, they lose their kingdoms; if ministers err, they receive punishment; if scholars err, their names are blotted out; if commoners err, their blessings are seized. All errors and evils have their just retribution. How much more shall ye who do evil have no recompense? 

Therefore, ye later disciples of my teaching must examine your own hearts. Why did ye leave home and family? It is to see through earthly ties and the sufferings of reincarnation, and then to advance on the way. How can ye go contrary to this and commit errors, increasing sins? The Law has three vehicles; follow the orthodox teaching and act according to your strength, set your resolve and keep it, practise bitter discipline and cultivate, thus is the true path of those who leave the home.

The highest vehicle is to cultivate the True and nurture the Nature, to labour the will in the depths of mystery, to attain the wondrous Way of Void and Nothingness above all, and to manifest the righteous breath of Heaven and Earth. To expunge the grievances of the dusty world, widely practice benevolence and righteousness, and greatly accumulate latent merit, only waiting till three thousand merits are full, and eight hundred practices complete; then the body transcends the Three Realms, and the rank of Immortals is attained! Some ride the phoenix and crane to court the Golden Palace; some drive the coloured phoenix to visit the Jade Pool. The myriad spirits reverently attend, and the myriad saints uphold. With Heaven and Earth as one body, and the sun and moon shining together—are not such men the great heroes of those who leave home? 

The middle vehicle is to hold the mind and expound the teaching, to perform rites of confession and recite the scriptures, to chant the Supreme One’s ritual texts, to worship the Heavenly Venerable’s precious titles, to pray with faith and earnestness before the spirits, and to observe pure fasts in the temple. Cleansing body and mind, to explain and spread the Great Way; with one thought pure and true, constantly preserving the orthodox law; when the time comes for the Law to decline or vanish, good spirits will guard and assist. Some may be sent to the imperial court, others born into officialdom; some rise to be ministers and attain the Three Councils; some serve kings and their names enter the Nine-Fives. At such times the ten thousand people reverence them; the four seas submit; among men they are distinguished and honoured—are they not to be respected? 

The lower vehicle is to build palaces and temples, to print scriptures and carve images, to repair bridges and mend roads, to abstain from killing and to release life, to offer tea and set up pharmacies, to promote the root of compassion, and to abandon thoughts of greed and avarice. Some relieve the poor and needy, their hearts humble and lowly; they honour teachers and respect friends, receive and entertain visitors, love the aged and cherish the poor. When their merits and deeds are complete, there will be golden boys to escort and transform them into men, born into wealthy and noble families, enjoying inexhaustible blessings all their lives—how joyful is this! 

Thus are the practices of the three vehicles distinctly laid down, each word clear and explicit. If ye do not awaken and remove wine, lust, wealth, and anger, it is better to return to the world and go home! To take suffering as pleasure, to follow the desires of the heart, to act at will—how can this be profitable or joyful? To linger long in the Mysterious Gate, bewildered and unawakened, forging boundless sins, the retribution cannot be escaped! If there be those with sincere resolve, they may deeply enter with no former ties; if not, they will quickly retreat. Otherwise, sins will double; I deeply pity you! For this cause I instruct thus.

If any, having seen these instructions, return to their hearts; having heard, change their thoughts; renew their firm resolve; bitterly reform past faults; courageously and diligently advance; those who hear may awaken, those who see may be enlightened. To awaken is the mind turning back to light; to enlighten is the intention reflecting back. If ye do not awaken early, ye will surely lose your true nature forever, fall into the dark path, ever sink in the sea of suffering, transform into strange beings. When that time comes, what repentance will avail? O wise and enlightened ones, consider carefully: if this life be missed, the Great Way is hard to find!
