# Appendix Three: The Song of Qiu Zu’s Azure Heaven

### The Song of Qiu Zu’s Azure Heaven  
Let not floating clouds arise to bar the Azure Heaven;  
When clouds arise, the Azure Heaven hides myriad phenomena.  
Myriad phenomena, densely arrayed, suppress a hundred evils;  
When brightness does not appear, the demons wax strong.  
At first I opened the expanse; Heaven and Earth were clear;  
Ten thousand households and a thousand gates sang of great peace.  
Sometimes a patch of dark clouds rises;  
All nine orifices and a hundred bones are restless.  
Therefore I long instruct the keen wind fiercely;  
Through the three realms and ten directions it drifts clear.  
When clouds disperse, the void body is itself true;  
Naturally appears, each home’s moon.  
Under the moon one may well take up the flute to blow;  
One clear, loud note shakes the splendid lands.  
It startles the jade youth of the East;  
He rides backwards a white deer, like a star in flight.  
Circling, turning, a singular joy;  
Neither a sheng nor a horn.  
Three feet of cloud jade, twelve emblems;  
Through kalpas and years the primordial is sculpted.  
The jade tone rings clear, transcending the Zheng pitch;  
Light and pure, it pervades the hearts of the awakened.  
From one I received aid of ghosts and spirits;  
Entering earth and heaven, transcending ancient and present.  
Free and unbound, uncontrolled;  
The mind covets not honour, the body suffers no shame.  
Leisurely singing the white snow song within the gourd;  
Calmly tuning the spring melody beyond the world.  
In my home this melody is all natural;  
The pipe has no holes, the zither no strings.  
Attaining it, I am startled awake from the floating life’s dream;  
Day and night the clear sounds fill the caverns of heaven.

Annotations by Hunranzi

Let not floating clouds arise to bar the Azure Heaven; the great Way is originally non-action.  
When clouds arise, the Azure Heaven hides myriad phenomena; that which is deliberate is all error.  
Azure Heaven refers to human nature; floating clouds refer to human杂念 (杂念,杂念—varied distracting thoughts). These two lines are the outline for cultivators. In the ordinary course of the day and night, the mind must be pure and the intention clear; not a speck of private thought should arise, lest it block the true nature and the natural, like the Azure Heaven unbarred by clouds. If one’s mind is not master, in contact with objects and circumstances the thoughts follow accordingly, wandering ever farther; this is like clouds arising to hide myriad phenomena.  

Myriad phenomena densely arrayed suppress a hundred evils; nature is tranquil, desires at ease.  
When brightness does not appear, the demons wax strong; the mind moves and the spirit tires.  
This means that when the one nature is in its proper place, hundreds of evils return to it; then within the body Heaven and Earth and myriad qi are one qi; myriad spirits are one spirit. Naturally the mind-lord is calm and steady, and suppresses a hundred evils. If anger cannot be checked, desire not restrained, feelings let loose without return, one falls under the sway of demons; then our brightness is not shown, and evil demons grow strong.  

At first I opened the expanse; Heaven and Earth were clear; restrain self and return to rites.  
Ten thousand households and a thousand gates sang of great peace; all under Heaven return to benevolence.  
This speaks of one who has attained the Way, who perceives that the body’s origin is nothing, but merely so clear and pure preserving truth, always like a newborn child; nature is empty and life firm; the whole body’s four great elements, eighty-four thousand fine pores, blood and qi circulate freely without impediment. The Book of Changes, hexagram Kun, says: “Yellow in the middle penetrates principle; right place dwells in the body; freely to the four limbs; beauty is within.” Is this not the Heaven and Earth being clear and ten thousand households peaceful?  

Sometimes a patch of dark clouds rises; anger unchecked, desire unrestrained.  
All nine orifices and a hundred bones are restless; water and fire fail to aid.  
This means when evil thoughts arise, like dark clouds gathering. At such times one must quickly be aware, and turn back the light to reflect inwardly and nurture one’s good heart. If there is no restraint, and one follows what the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and four gates leak, becoming the servant of form, the heavenly nature will be like dark clouds locking shut; the sea of suffering will be stirred by waves of lust. Thus all nine orifices and a hundred bones are restless. The Dao De Jing says: “Open its gates, aid its affairs, whole life unwearied.” The Zen school says: “Do not fear the arising of evil thoughts, only fear the tardiness of awareness.” Mencius also said: “Losing the chicken and dog yet knowing to seek; letting loose the mind and not knowing to seek, alas!” Learners must be cautious indeed.  

Therefore long I instruct the keen wind fiercely; when spirit emerges it is gathered back.  
Through the three realms and ten directions it drifts clear; washing heart and cleansing thought.  
This passage warns the student to keep the mind always in the breast; each motion and stillness depends on purity and firmness; not to oppose all conditions. When meeting various forms, one must resolutely fix the will, and beware of stirring thought. The Perfected Yin Xi said: “When things come, I respond with nature, not with mind.” The Diamond Sutra also says: “Do not respond to forms with arising of mind; do not respond to sounds, smells, tastes, touches, or dharmas with arising of mind; one should generate mind without abiding anywhere; thus subdue the mind.” Confucius said: “A gentleman is at home in his place and acts accordingly; he does not desire what is outside.” This teaches that if the mind-lord can maintain correctness, wisdom naturally becomes perfect; then the three treasures in the body return to their root, and the ten directions are purified, with no obstruction.  

When clouds disperse, the void body is itself true; the one truth constantly exists.  
Naturally appears, each home’s moon; the whole body is the Way.  
This continues the above: having attained the three realms and ten directions, drifting clear, no thought arises; then my true nature constantly exists; its subtlety permeates the whole body; star and moon both appear brightly. This is the way of inner vision and sitting forgetfulness. As the Scripture on Deliverance says: “All heavens restore their place.” Similarly repeated by Yan Zi.  

Under the moon one may well take up the flute to blow; the Gui hour must be urgently seized.  
One clear, loud note shakes the splendid lands; the returning wind blends all.  
Now speaking of the work of cultivation of life. The moon below means the hour of Zi at winter solstice, where yang moves, the Gui hour is born. At this time one must act swiftly, calling on spirit to breathe, qi returning to the orifices, blowing its note within, closing the gates outside, harmonising pitch and tone, blending myriad spirits. This is to blow the flute without holes inside the body, sending forth one clear, loud note that vibrates Hua and Yi (China and the Barbarians). Without a true master, the secret words cannot be known.  

It startles the jade youth of the East; the Water Palace seeks the mysterious.  
He rides backwards a white deer, like a star in flight; taking Kan and filling Li.  
Startled means the steaming up, rising from below. The East is the wood of Jia giving rise to fire at the Yin position. The jade youth is the flying spirit of flowing intention. Riding backwards is reversal. The white deer is refined essence transformed into white qi. In sum, at the time of entering the elixir chamber, the nature-lord governs flowing intention, sinking to the Water Palace to steam, preserving the root within; waiting for the yang fire to grow strong; lifting and moving to the head’s gate; turning from Yin to Ji, flowing through Wu earth, urging the governor fire; pressing the metal essence; straight through the three gates; ascending to the southern palace; filling the Yin within Li; thereby forming the Qian image, swift as a shooting star.  

Circling, turning, a singular joy; going out, coming in not.  
Neither a sheng nor a horn; the form without form.  
Circling means gradually closing; from above downward. The joy turning similarly means the six yang join Qian; yang has no ultimate principle. One yin is born beneath five yang; following this is gradual closing. From Wu to Hai, with Ji earth retreating the Yin talisman, passing beneath the Golden Gate, the Magpie Bridge and splendid pond, abundant and pouring, entering the red palace of the multi-storied tower; straight on to the Kun palace’s earthen cauldron and stopping. Producing a bright pearl like a full moon, unlike a sheng or horn.  

Three feet of cloud jade, twelve emblems, three flowers gathered in the cauldron.  
Through kalpas and years the primordial is sculpted; five qi greet the origin.  
This continues the above meaning of the turning joy. Three feet of cloud jade means the three kinds of great medicine returning to the cauldron, wondrously combined and condensed true; in a breath’s work it recaptures the year’s twelve months of creation. The elixir scripture says: “Gather year into month, gather month into day, gather day into hour; within one hour use two phases; circulate the heavenly fire; gather medicine into the chamber; carry out inner work; blend, fuse, and forge; form the sacred embryo.” Thus it is said: “Through kalpas and years the primordial is sculpted.” The Scripture on Deliverance says: “The middle principle five qi, blending myriad spirits; ten turns returning spirit; myriad qi all immortal.” The Son of Perfection says: “The three great medicines are essence, qi, and spirit; natural son and mother mutually intimate; return wind blends and returns to true body; forging work daily renewed.”  

The jade tone rings clear, transcending the Zheng pitch; Heaven has no floating veil.  
Light and pure, it pervades the hearts of the awakened; the four qi bright and clear.  
This continues the meaning of blending and forging. The jade tone ringing means the success of true fire’s forging work, shedding old stains and dirt; thus obtaining harmony of spirit and qi, like Shun and Shao’s pure music; thereby cutting off the licentious Zheng tone; awakening the body’s earth into jade, without anomaly; naturally pervading and reaching the human heart. The Scripture on Deliverance says: “Gold is true, bright and fragrant; flowing sounds cloud encampments; jade tones capture qi; spirit winds gather smoke.” Without true transmission and actual work, how could one know such subtlety?  

From one I received aid of ghosts and spirits; demons dare not offend.  
Entering earth and heaven, transcending ancient and present; transformations by me.  
This means the Way of the Elixir is complete and transformation free; then the universe is within me, myriad transformations return to the body. At this stage, yin and yang move by my will; five elements I command; wind and rain I summon; thunder and lightning I call. Thus the great body appears, pervading fine dust; hiding the small body, bearing Mount Sumeru. Therefore ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its machinery; they bind their heads and serve as guards; enter its earth and heaven; transcending ancient and present, all is mine; transformations are boundless.  

Free and unbound, uncontrolled; not bound by form.  
The mind covets not honour, the body suffers no shame; inside and outside both forgotten.  
Continuing the above transcendence of ancient and present. Thus free and unbound means the Way alone is the body, not following worldly change; reversing and twisting, transformations are by me; how can there be restraint? Wealth and honour, at this time all utterly overturned; how can the mind still covet honour or the body endure shame? This is the living path; if not for the resolute measures of a great man, how could one reach this?  

Leisurely singing the white snow song within the gourd; the Way great and vast and empty.  
Calmly tuning the spring melody beyond the world; transcending the three realms.  
This means leisurely singing is obtaining the true joy. Then my body has another gourd-heaven scene; always flying white snow filling the sky, pure and clear, without a speck of dust. The Zhuangzi calls this “a void chamber produces white; spirit and brightness come of themselves.” The Perfected Yin also said: “One breath darkens feelings and ascends the great Way.” This is why nine harmonies and ten unions, one qi pure yang, transcending the three realms; is it not singing the spring melody?  

In my home this melody is all natural; form and spirit both subtle.  
The pipe has no holes, the zither no strings; united with the Way to attain truth.  
This means the nine-turn elixir is finished, shedding the fetters, transforming spirit; this is the way of nature, body like the void; not a form image to be seen. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One said: “It cannot be seen, nor heard; apart from all boundaries; called the wondrous Way.” How could the pipe indeed have holes or the zither strings? These matters may be silently understood by the ancients; the Way is originally formless; I am not I; iron walls and silver mountains, suddenly pierced through. If the learner gains one phrase here, the study is complete; what doubt remains?  

Attaining it, I am startled awake from the floating life’s dream; the void is powder and dust.  
Day and night the clear sounds fill the caverns of heaven, revealing alone the golden truth.  
This section concludes with the subtlety from beginning to end. What is attained is the true Way, eternally witnessing the adamantine, indestructible body; awakening to the floating life’s all conditioned laws, as dream and illusion only. This is attaining today the supreme wondrous Way; within the body day and night there is always immortal music; filling the caverns of heaven. This also warns future students: even if one gains fame and renown, surpasses in writings, if one does not gain the true transmission of the supreme Way, in the end all is vanity and unreality, no substance. If one only indulges in greed and delusion, drifting into floating life’s dreams, endless cycles, how can one escape birth and death? Only a resolute man can believe, penetrate, sever, one awakening turning back, directly transcending the formless realm, to cultivate the great Way; inwardly preserving spirit and nourishing qi, outwardly blending with the mundane dust. This is in the world and beyond the world, riding together with immortals and Buddhas; is this not truth spoken?
