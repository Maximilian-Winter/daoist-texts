# Precious Declaration of the Divine Firmament

With devoted heart I turn to pay homage.  
The High and Lofty Divine Firmamentâ€™s Mansion,  
Where spirit is gathered and brilliant radiance shines forth.  
Here the Primordial Ancestor of the Origin meets and divides the True Qi;  
Responding to the wondrous Tao of Emptiness and Nothingness, He unfolds creation.  
Placed above the Ninth Firmament, He governs all the heavens;  
Encompassing the ten extremes, He presides over myriad transformations.  
He proclaims the Golden Talismans, letting their light descend to relieve suffering,  
Dispensing grace and nurture over the myriad peoples.  
His favour spreads through the Primordial Heaven, His benevolence extends over vast eons.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy;  
The Jade Pure True King; The Emperor of Long Life at the Southern Pole;  
The Sovereign of the Heavenly Origin, the Holy Exalted Heaven-Respected One.
