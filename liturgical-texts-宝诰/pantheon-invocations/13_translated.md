# The Precious Edict of the Five Elders

With heart and mind devoted, I bow and surrender my life.  
The primal ancestors of Yin and Yang, the root and origin of Heaven and Earth.  
Receiving the edict and mandate from the Jade Emperor,  
Holding the incantations and seals of the Spiritual Treasure.  
Gathering the written characters of brocade and seal script, issuing forth the quintessence of the Five Vapours;  
Wearing the red sash and cinnabar pouch, radiating the splendour of the Three Luminaries.  
They sing the flute and chant within the Hall of Cold Spirits,  
They swiftly traverse the Palace of the Purple Tenuity.  
They refine and transcend the body, suppress and dispel demons and evil.  
Great compassion, great vow; great saint, great mercyâ€”  
The Five Spirits and the Five Elders, the Sovereign Emperors on High,  
The Heavenly Venerables who save men and protect life.
