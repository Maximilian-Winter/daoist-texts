# The Precious Edict of the Eastern King Duke

With reverent heart I bow and submit.  
Pure and subtle is the Great Way, the Limitless Divine Lord.  
The primordial transformation of vital breath divides the true;  
The hidden dragon of the Purple Mansion must not be employed.  
He is proclaimed Emperor on the Mountain of the Directions,  
Charged with the heavenly registers of the immortals.  
He sets up the gate above the Blue Sea,  
His Way is called to nurture and bring forth all living things.  
The Three Palaces have officials to govern,  
The Eight Emperors form the seat of non-action.  
At the appointed time he ascends the platform,  
Turning his gaze to the south with dignified grace,  
Purple breath comes forth from the east,  
Deep, tranquil, truly still.  
He manifests mysteriousåŠŸ (merit or efficacy), the supreme lord,  
The ancestor of the myriad true ones.  
Great compassion and great vow,  
Great sage and great mercy.  
The Great Officer of Life of the Eastern Flower,  
The Sovereign Lord of Lesser Yang,  
The Emperor Lord of Fusang,  
The Heavenly Venerable Eastern King Wood Duke.
