# Precious Edict of the Great Emperor of the Earth Official of the Zhongyuan

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself. The Azure Spirit, the Cavern of Yang, within the Palace of the Northern Capital. He commands the forty-two departments, together with nine hundred millions of hosts. He presides over the three realms, the ten quarters, and the nine earths; he holds sway over the five great mountains, the eight extremities, and the four directions.

He breathes out and inhales Yin and Yang, and inspects the records of good and evil, male and female, of the blue and black registers; compassionate in nurturing Heaven and Earth, he examines the registers of living beings, their names of misfortune and fortune.

His law is vast and wide, enabling escape from the Nine Netherworlds; his mighty calamity extends its radiance and can destroy ten thousand sins. Father and mother of all living things, to the living and the dead he extends his favour. Great in compassion and great in vow; greatly holy and greatly merciful.

The Earth Official who, by the seven qi of Zhongyuan, pardons sins; the Spirit of the Cavern and Azure Void, the Great Emperor, the Azure Spirit Lord.
