# The Precious Declaration of the Fire Officer

With a heart bent in reverence, I submit myself in homage. The Four Primal Ones and the Four Ranks examine and compare the Fire Officer. His motion supports the vigorous Heaven, his virtue accords with the luminous Li. He dwells in the Central Heaven of the Great Sun Pillar, presiding over the Left Office, recording the registers of life. His abundant virtue is in Fire; the Flame Emperor holds the balance. HisåŠŸ (merits) cooperate with the Three Primal Ones; his qi moves through the four months. He rides the Red Dragon and proceeds to the Southern Land; illuminating the palace of the fiery Mars; he lights the Vermilion Mound and reveals the Red Terrace; resplendent is the Mansion of Literary Flourishing. Radiant and bright, shining and illuminating all beneath. Great pity, great vow; great sage, great mercy; the Supreme Red Sovereign of the Three Qi, the Fire Officer, the True Lord Flame Emperor, the Great Emperor of Profound Yang, the Southern Red Chronicle of Longevity Heaven.
