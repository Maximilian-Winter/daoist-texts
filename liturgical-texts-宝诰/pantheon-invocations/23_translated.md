# The Precious Edict of the Marshal of Heavenly Strategy

With devoted heart and reverent mind I take refuge and pay homage.  
In the midst of Heavenâ€™s mystery, on the right of the Palace of Illumination,  
He commands as the deputy marshal of the Heavenly Gang,  
And is arrayed among the feudal lords of the nether earth.  
He pities the common and dull, who are lost and mistaken, and so forfeit the truth.  
He looks up to the great light of the holy minister and composes the preface;  
He praises and unfolds the hidden harmonies of the many heavens,  
And declares the immortal writings of the Great Brahma.  
He bends down to cherish the sincerity of those who revere and serve,  
And grants great power to protect and sustain them.  
Clouds follow his steps and issue forth; the sea flows after his body.  
Great compassion and great vows, great saint and great mercy;  
Heavenly communication brings prayers and blessings, extends good fortune and cleanses calamity,  
Nourishing and fostering life and being.  
He is the Marshal of the Heavenly Strategy at the Northern Pole,  
The Universal Transforming Heavenly Emperor,  
The Perfected Fruit, Harmonious and Responsive, the Venerable of Goodness.
