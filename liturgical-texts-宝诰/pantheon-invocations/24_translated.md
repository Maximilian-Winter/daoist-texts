# The Precious Edict of the Marshal Assisting the Sacred

With devoted heart and reverent mind I take refuge and pay homage.  
The Imperial Gatekeeper has accomplished his task, and is placed in rank within the Heavenly Court.  
He commands the mandates of the Three Caverns and the Five Thunders.  
He holds the balance of the Eight Heavens and the Nine Earths.  
He desires to steer the hinge of creation and transformation.  
He is the general and officer of the attendant true immortals.  
He slays all evil without exception; what demon dares to oppose him?  
He restrains the demons of great might.  
He drives away the monstrous fiends like shooting stars.  
His radiance is as the sun and moon, his might shakes Heaven and Earth.  
Great is his compassion and great his vow; great is his saintliness and great his mercy.  
He penetrates Heaven and divides protection; he extends auspiciousness and cleanses calamity.  
He guards and sustains the body and life.  
He is the Northern Pole Marshal Assisting the Sacred, Great Marshal of Black Slaughter;  
The True Lord of Conserving Celebration and Preserving Virtue.  
Having attained fruition, he roams and manifests among the Three Realms as the Heavenly Venerable.
