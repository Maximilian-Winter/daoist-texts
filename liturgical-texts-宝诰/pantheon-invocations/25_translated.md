# Universal Transformation Precious Injunction

With a heart devoted and reverent, I take refuge and pay homage.  
The Palace of Responding Origins in the Nine Heavens, the Sovereign of the Supreme Jade Purity.  
Transforming form and filling the Ten Directions, discoursing on the Way and sitting upon the Nine Phoenixes.  
Above the Thirty-six Heavens, reviewing the precious registers, examining the jade books;  
Before fifteen hundred kalpas, established as the Perfect Truth, vested with great power of transformation.  
In his hand he raises the golden light of the wish-fulfilling jewel, proclaiming the Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot.  
Those who do not follow transformation become but dust; issuing commands swift as wind and fire.  
With a heart of purity and stillness, he magnifies the great vow;  
With the power of wisdom, he subdues all demons.  
Overseer of the Five Thunders, directing the minds within the Three Realms.  
Father of all living beings, master of myriad spirits, most holy, most compassionate, supremely august in the way,  
The Heavenly Lord of Universal Transformation, the Thunder-sound Responding Origin of the Nine Heavens.
