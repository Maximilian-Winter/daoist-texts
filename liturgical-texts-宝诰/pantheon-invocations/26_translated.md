# Precious Declaration of the Thunder Ancestor

With devoted heart and reverential life I take refuge and make obeisance.  
The High and Lofty Jade Firmament Mansion, the Thunder and Lightning Cavernous Abyssal Palace.  
The three realms divide the true; the nine heavens unfold and transform.  
Light convenes at the surface of the Great Luo; divine powers vast and boundless in the heavens.  
Relieving drought and flood in the lower regions; dispelling insects and locusts through countless kalpas.  
He who issues forth the noble vows, for the benefit and salvation of all living beings.  
Great Sage, Great Compassion, Great Mercy, Great Vow; the Nine Heavens Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor,  
The Celestial Worthy who removes calamities and aids creatures.
