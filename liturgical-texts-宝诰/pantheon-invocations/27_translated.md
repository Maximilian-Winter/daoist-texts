# Precious Declaration of the Great One

With devoted heart I bow and surrender my life in reverence.  
To the most high abode on the brilliant azure heights,  
the Purple Tenuity and the Palace of Jade Green.  
Its radiance is resplendent and solemn, the truth condensed in the Supreme Ultimate.  
There it issues forth the wondrous breath at the Golden Gate,  
and manifests the great transformation in the primordial chaos.  
It returns the simple wind to the remnants of the moist rain,  
and preserves the regulation of the cycles of the kalpa;  
it extends beneficent grace upon the surface of the universe,  
and nurtures the common people.  
The Great Sage, the Great Compassionate, the Great Merciful, the Great Vow;  
the Upper Clarity, the Purple Tenuity and the Palace of Jade Green;  
the Great Heavenly Emperor of the Great One;  
the Lord who guards and regulates the kalpa cycles, the Heavenly Venerable.
