# Exhortation of the Six Waves of Treasure

With sincere heart I bow and submit my life in homage.  
In the Purple Heaven, the Superior Region, the Palace of the Six Waves in Heaven;  
A wondrous form of radiant brightness appears, displaying a kindly countenance at the One of Heaven;  
Dwelling in the vast expanse of the celestial abode, bestowing blessings and benefits upon the human world.  
He guards against the great deluge of boundless chaos, and aids against the fiery terrors of the consuming flames.  
He fuses myriad streams into one, comprehending and governing the primal unity.  
The Great Sage, Great Compassionate One, Great Mercy, Great Vow, the Sovereign Lord of the Six Waves in Heaven universally dispenses the Dharma and moistens the Celestial Venerable.
