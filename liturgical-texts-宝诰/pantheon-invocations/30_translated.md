# The Precious Edict of Investigation

With heart devoted and vows made, I pay reverent homage.  
The Purple Mystery, the Radiance of Splendid Light, the Mansion of the Nine Heavens for the Preservation of Destiny.  
The Supreme Way divides the light, embracing the Brahman breath of the ten quarters;  
The True and Constant manifests the Marvelous, turning back the scorching winds of countless kalpas.  
Gathering and recording in the various heavens, it registers good deeds and cancels the record of evil;  
Its grace blends with the myriad transformations, marking the characters of reward and promoting the rise of names.  
The Great Sage, Great Compassion, Great Mercy, Great Vow,  
The Sovereign of Vermilion Mound of the Nine Heavens who investigates and summons,  
The Responsive Origin and Protector of Destiny, the Wondrously Transforming Heavenly Venerable.
