# Precious Command of the Great Yin Star Lord

With devoted heart I pay homage and make obeisance. Above in the Great Luo Heaven, within the Seven Treasures Garden, he holds the quintessence of gold and water, his bearing graceful and refined. Inherent is the softness and obedience of the primal Earth pattern; auspicious countenance solemn and dignified. He unfolds the divine radiance of the Jade Candle, his household enriched by pure dew, refining the sacred medicine of the Purple Chamber. To men he bestows long life; though faint is the gleam, his true form is unblemished; his measure filled to the brim, his bright splendour never overflows. He examines the ascent and descent of the immortals, presides over the weighing of offices and emoluments. He commands the Jade Consort to nurture the sweet dew, urges open the springtime visage of myriad grains. He consults the Azure Maiden to bring down the mysterious frost, gathers and stores the autumn harvests of a thousand granaries. His transformations reach men and heaven alike; his grace extends throughout the three realms. Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy. The Moonâ€™s mansion, Great Yin, conjoins with the Ling Emperor; his precious radiance dimly illuminates the Thus-Come One. The Wondrous Fruit, the Pure Moon, the Heavenly Venerable.
