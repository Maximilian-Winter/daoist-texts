# The Precious Edict of the Central Dipper

With devoted heart I turn and submit, paying homage and reverence.  
Its station is in the Centre, commanding the four quarters.  
In upright repose it sits serene and secret, unfolding and arranging the mingled vastness.  
The four extremities support and wing it, greatly luminous and splendid.  
The seven rulers and the celestial pivot, the two luminaries concealed and assisting.  
It governs all phenomena, upholding the order and the law.  
Strictly marshals the heavens, the boundless divine abode.  
Completing beginning and end, the source of creation and transformation.  
The saint of saints, the spirit of spirits.  
It embraces the countless, nourishes the masses of beings.  
Great compassion, great vow; great saint, great mercy.  
The Great Lord of the Chief Star, the Most True Sovereign of the Firmament,  
The Middle Spirit, the Boundless Heavenly Exalted One.
