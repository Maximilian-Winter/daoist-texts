# Sacred Declaration of the Eastern Dipper

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
His功 (merits) partake of the Purple Ultimate; Kui shines forth the brilliance of Wenchang.  
He governs the spiritual images in the Nine Firmaments, and directs the division of the enclosures in the Two Luminaries.  
The Blue Yang unfolds its grace, encircling the mysterious currents of the Milky Way.  
The Jade Axis proclaims the workings, assisting the portent of thunder’s sovereign tokens.  
He presides over manifest brightness while lightning circles and rainbows fly;  
He propels the processes of transformation and the seasonal stars of the Pleiades.  
We encircle him with auspicious prosperity, we honour him with blessings surrounding.  
Great Compassion, Great Vows; Great Sage, Great Mercy.  
The Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Extreme, the Blue Flower Lord,  
Ruler of the Lofty Void, Highest of the Six Heavens,  
From whom blessings flow and life is prolonged, the Heavenly Venerable of increasing felicity.
