# The Precious Admonition of the Southern Dipper

With devoted heart I bow in reverence and submit my life. The Supreme Subtlety shines in its true brightness, the Southern Poleâ€™s chief attendant. He presides over the Yang officials, and governs the fire emperor. His station is in the Palace of Separation, and his name accords with the shining sun; he follows the handle of the Dipper and encircles the seven origins. He aids Heaven and Earth in their work of abundant nurture, embodying the illumination of the Way and virtue. Receiving the nature and descending the spirits, he holds the governance of the generation of beings and things; he fashions souls and molds spirits, managing the pivot of the transformations between Heaven and man. He regulates the orders and dispels calamities, extending longevity and universal blessings. The utmost sage and highest lord, of great compassion and great vow. The great sage of Central Heaven, the six officers of the Southern Dipper, the Lord of Longevity Stars. The great emperor of the Longevity Stars, the Yang Bright Universal Salvation Heavenly Venerable.

With utmost heart I bow in reverence and submit my life. His station is exalted at the Southern Pole, chiefly presiding over the Palace of Separation. He reverently dwells above, condensed at the North Star; suddenly he descends and surveys the heavenly realm. He commands the great transformations, nourishing and rearing the myriad people. The three powers all belong to his illumination; the six directions all return to his control. Of great compassion and great vow; the great sage and great mercy. The six officers of the Southern Dipper, Lords of Longevity Stars.
