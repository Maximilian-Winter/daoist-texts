# Precious Declaration of the Star Lord Ju Men

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself. Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, in the Palace of the Earth Origin,  
He governs the common folk below with secret wisdom; it is only by the divine that they are saved in wondrous ways.  
He is the mighty arm and thigh of the Supreme Emperor; if not the sacred virtue, who else could accomplish thus?  
He turns the heavenly stars within the hollow of his hand, and binds the terrestrial fiends beneath the foremost constellations.  
Of great compassion and great vow, of great holiness and great mercy,  
The Great Saint of the Central Heaven, the second Yin Essence of the Northern Dipper, the Star Lord of the Great Way Ju Men.
