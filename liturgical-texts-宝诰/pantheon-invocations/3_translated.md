# Precious Admonition of the Jade Purity

With devoted heart and reverent mind I bow in submission. Above the three realms is the Brahman Qi of Mi-lo. The highest summit is without peer, the Heaven above Heavens. The Yü-lo Xiao Terrace, the Jade Mountain’s Supreme Capital. The golden palaces are boundless, the myriad forms pure and bright. The Mysterious Origin, One Qi, before Chaos. Within the Precious Pearl, mysterious beyond mystery. It unfolds the Three Luminaries, and brings forth transformation that births the myriad Heavens. Countless are the true Heavens, beyond reckoning or number. Revolving the Dipper and calibrating the Winnowing Basket, it regulates the Five Constants. Lofty and august is the Great Model, the ancestor of the myriad ways. The Great Net of Jade Purity, Void and Naturalness, Most True and Marvelous Way, Primordial Heavenly Worthy.
