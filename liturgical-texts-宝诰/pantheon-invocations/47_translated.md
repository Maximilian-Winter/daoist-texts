# Precious Edict of the Lord of the Life-Determining Star

With devoted heart I bow and take refuge. Within the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, in the Southern Pole Palace, once every year He descends to the mortal world, appointed to the day of the toil that gave me life. Six times in the flowing year He comes down to the human sphere, on the very day when the highest Heaven confers form. He is lord over the human body, the pivot of creation and transformation. He determines the fixed seasons of good and evil among men, and holds the eyes for right and wrong in the Yin realm. The Five Elements jointly sustain Him, the Seven Luminaries together attend His charge. Whosoever prays to Him finds no petition unfulfilled. Great is His compassion and great His vow; mighty is His holiness and boundless His mercy. In the Palace of the Heavenly Wheel of the Northern Dipper is born the Lord of the Original Life Star of the Great Way.
