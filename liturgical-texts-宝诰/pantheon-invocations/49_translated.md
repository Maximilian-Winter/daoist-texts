# The Precious Edict of the Emperor Wenchang

With devoted heart and reverence I take refuge and make obeisance. Proud is not the realm of the Emperor. The Jade True one of the Palace of Celebration manifests the course and repose of the ninety-eight transformations. He displays the wonders and marvels of countless myriads of kinds. The flying luan bird unfolds transformation everywhere; with the wish-fulfilling jewel he rescues from calamity to bring forth life anew. Most filial and most benevolent, his merits abide in Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism alike. Neither arrogant nor joyful, he fulfils his office under Heaven and Earth, the Water Official. His merits and virtues are hard to measure; his majesty and spirit beyond calculation. Great compassion and great vows, great saint and great kindness. He of the Nine Heavens assists the origin; the master and sovereign of transformation; the director of emoluments and the officer in charge of tribute, the true Lord. In seven winding responses, he preserves virtue and magnifies benevolence, the Great Emperor. He expounds the scriptures and unfolds the teaching; dispels calamity and enacts transformation. The Venerable of Eternal Life and Rebirth.
