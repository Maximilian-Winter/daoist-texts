# General Declaration of the Constellations

With a heart of devotion I pay homage and lay down my life. Lofty and high is the round canopy, vast and boundless is the Great Net. Ziwei takes its place above the Northern Pole; Gouchen dwells in the inner seat. The Sun Emperor and the Moon Sovereign fix the times of dawn and dusk with precision. The Southern Star and the Northern Dipper govern life and death without partiality. The five planets shine in array, the four luminaries distinguish themselves clearly. Two Emperors conceal themselves on the celestial steps; the Three Enclosures attend before the Imperial throne. The heavens are divided into twenty-eight lodges, forming in all the thirty-two heavens. The Three Platforms follow together the Dipper’s pole; the Heavenly Gang alone presides at the Gate of Thunder. The twelve palaces mark the hours as the celestial wheel revolves. The sixty Jiazi revolve in cycles among the stars. The Lord of Fate is assigned to its proper domain; the embryo’s birth never parts from the original star. Bright stars and dark luminaries shine directly and by their side. The Jade Palace is linked by pearls as a symbol; the Purple Heaven is united like a jade disk without pause. Upright and reverent is Ziwei, following the path of the Yellow Road. The myriad forms of creation, the array of the lodges and grouped stars: the masters of the Golden Well and Jade Balance, the true officers of the Milky Way’s azure river. The primal fate, original star, allotted limits, and fortunes of the horse: throughout the circumpolar heaven’s course, the arrayed stars are the Lords of the Constellations.
