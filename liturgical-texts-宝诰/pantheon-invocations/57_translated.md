# The Precious Edict of the Celestial True Sovereign

With devoted heart I prostrate and submit my life in reverence. In the pure and subtle heights above Heaven, amid the assembly beneath the precious canopy. He arose at the beginning of the great kalpa, assisting and upholding the transformations of the Jade Purity. Receiving the primal qi as his substance, he holds the divine incantations in the spirit capital. A celestial book one zhang in length, enduring successive kalpas without decay; the clouds and seals of the five directions are inscribed, so that as confusion is placed, it becomes ever more clear. Revealing the hidden mechanism and sealing the source and streams. Great compassion, great vow; great saint, great mercy. The natural great immortal, the Celestial True Sovereign.
