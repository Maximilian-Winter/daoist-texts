# Precious Scripture of the Western Peak

I reverently bow my heart and submit my life in homage.  
The wondrous realm of Western Splendour, the highest grade of the Heavenly Palace.  
Receiving the true transmission of the Jasper Pool,  
Unfolding the treasured scriptures of the Jade Emperor.  
To fly forth and attain the Way, then to awaken and perfect the Elixir.  
To verify the fruit of the Golden Stem, and thus ascend Mount Hua.  
To rescue from calamities and uphold those in distress, responding to things and to men.  
Whosoever has desires, their years will be lengthened and their blessings increased.  
Of great compassion and great vow, the great sage and great mercy.  
He who governs the calculation of life and fate, the Golden Heaven of the Western Peak,  
Greatly benefits and obeys the Holy Emperor, the Supreme Void without limit.  
He who presides as the Brahma True Lord, the Venerable Heavenly Being who records the reckonings in the Flowery Forest.
