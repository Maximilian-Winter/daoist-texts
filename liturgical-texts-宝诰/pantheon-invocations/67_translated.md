# Precious Edict of Fengdu

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself. His station is in the Northern Mansion, his office assigned to the Nether Capital. He holds the charge of life and death, rewarding the good and punishing the evil without omission. He exercises power to determine merit and fault, chastising the wicked and praising the worthy with no partiality. He guards the northern shadows, the dark mountains and rivers; he surveys the central caverns, the bright and luminous world. Lofty are his merits and virtues, to which ghosts and spirits all joyfully submit. Mighty and august is his spiritual power, whence the people alike partake in his beneficence. He presides over destiny and emoluments, adjudicating life and death. The ten palaces universally incline their hearts; the six caves together raise their hands in reverence. Great is his compassion and great his vow; great is his sanctity and great his mercy. In the underworld, the Northern Darkness, Fengdu Xuanqing the Great Emperor, the Heavenly Venerable who removes guilt in the Nine Hells.
