# The Precious Decree of the King of Darkness

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
To the Eastern Peak, A-Heng; to the Northern Capital, Feng-Ying.  
He who presides over good and evil, who holds the power over life and death.  
His righteous energy is august and majestic, closely observing the law alike for all.  
His sage heart is clear and steadfast, forgetting both favour and resentment.  
Brightly shines the mirror of guilt suspended on high; darkly arrayed the forms of shadow surround.  
He bears with the violent, yet they cannot break free; he suffers the crafty and deceitful, yet their plots are thwarted.  
Blessings bring one to the Heaven of happiness; distant blessings sink to the hell of the earth.  
Retribution is manifest and clear; cause and effect plainly displayed.  
The six paths look up to his grace; the four kinds of life lament their fate.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy.  
The ten kings of the Underworld, the benevolent and true Lord,  
With heart of ice and face of iron, the Heaven-honoured one.
