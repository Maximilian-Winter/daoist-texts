# Precious Edict of the Patriarch of the Way

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself. Born in the Han dynasty, he was bestowed a title in the Jin court. It was only by spreading the breath of Qi that he descended thus to expel evil, having once swallowed the tiger to save the world. He held the law of the Jade Mist Cave Immortals, and transmitted the scriptures of the mysterious chamber within. He presided over the Bureau of Thunderâ€™s punishments, and executed affairs of convenience in the office of the Commander-in-chief; he was appointed to the rank of Celestial Master, and promoted to the rank of Right Minister of the Purple Tenuity Heaven. He was judge over the Palace of Preserved Yang, and chief of the doctrine of the Primordial Chaos. He is the Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy, True and Original Pure Emperor, Supreme Void Universal Beneficent True Lord, the Treasure Register of the Nine Heavens, and the Honoured Sovereign of the Heavenly Destiny.
