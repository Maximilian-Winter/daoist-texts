# The Precious Edict of Master Ge Xian

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself in reverence. On Mount Tiantai he attained the Way, uniting the black to accomplish the true. In former times he received the teaching of the Eastern Florescence, and again transmitted it to Western Shu. By imperial edict from the Jade Capital and Golden Palace, he was ranked among the Immortals of the Supreme Ultimate. With compassion he pitied and delivered from the deep abysses; with grace and thoughtfulness he bestowed blessings everywhere upon the tormented and the joyous alike. The ancient wind of the Ge clan is manifest and clear in the record of leaks; today the cinnabar remains intact, and he roams at will over the expanse of Kuocang. At Mount Luofu he rests in the quiet glades; in Jade Chest he arranges the golden books. Great pity, great vow; great sage, great mercy; the Most High of Jade Capital, East Hao of the Supreme Ultimate, Left Palace Immortal Master; Thunder and Lightning, Profound Inspector of Heavenly Mysteries, Inner Minister of the Jade Void, Purple Spirit of Universal Transformation, Mysteriously Tranquil, Everlasting Way of the Void, Responsive and Faithful Protector True Lord; the Silkworm's Grace, Broad Salvation, Compassionate Great Emperor; He who Saves Men Without Measure, Heavenly Venerated One.
