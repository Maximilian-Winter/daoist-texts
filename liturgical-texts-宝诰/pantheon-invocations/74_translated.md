# Precious Edict of Lord Xu, the True One

With reverent heart I bow and submit my life in homage.  
The Primordial Ancestor of Chaos, the One Qi that divides the True.  
Long before the many kalpas, accumulating and cultivating the Supreme Way.  
Diligent and exact in all details, the texture of it grows ever profound.  
Ten thousand laws and a thousand gates, none fail to be thus passed through.  
To save from disaster and remove difficulties, to expel harm and sweep away demons.  
Meritorious in succouring living beings, his name exalted in the imperial records.  
All the spirits revere and look up to him, fitting that there should be a throne of honour.  
Of great compassion and great vow, great filial piety and great benevolence,  
The Supreme Historian of the immortal host of the nine provinces, the illustrious Great Commissioner,  
Thunder and Lightning, the Heavenly Pivot of the Supreme Province, the Exorcising Prime Minister,  
The Profound Response of the Supreme Way, the Divine Power of Miraculous Aid,  
Master of the Nine Heavens, Officer of Duties, Great Fixer of Destiny, Registrar of Life, True Lord,  
Inspector of the Three Heavens, Governor, Controller, Universal Reporter, Remonstrant Minister,  
Great Heavenly Physician, Forebearer in Deliverance of Men, Pure and Bright Universal Transforming Celestial Venerate.
