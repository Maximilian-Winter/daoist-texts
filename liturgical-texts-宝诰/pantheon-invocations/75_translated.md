# The Precious Admonition of the True Lord of the Three Maos

With devoted mind I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
He is the Way and Virtue of Heaven and Man, the Immortal Sage and True Master.  
Filial and fraternal, he penetrates the divine brightness;  
His grace and favour extend over family and state.  
He concealed himself in Mount Heng and there attained the Way;  
He dwelt in the crooked ravine and ascended to Heaven.  
He presides over Mount Tai, Mount Heng, and Mount Huo;  
He holds office in the caves of Chicheng and Huayang.  
He directs the cycles of Yin and Yang and governs their revolutions;  
He comprehends thunder, lightning, waters, and marshes, administering them in unity.  
He joins the splendid forms of the Two Brothers,  
And imparts the secret methods of ascending to truth.  
All share the register of the Immortals,  
Together they receive the honour of the Jade Tablet.  
His virtue pervades the hidden and the manifest;  
His benevolence moistens and guides all under his charge.  
He responds to timely occasions and moves with feeling,  
His vows are profound and vast.  
The True Lord of the Three Maos, perfect in the Great Origin,  
Dwelling in the Void, the Saint who protects with true assistance and true response;  
The Earth-Immortal, the Supremely True, Recorded in the Right Register,  
The Guard of the Supreme Way, abiding in Quietude, Virtue assisting the Marvelous Response, the True Lord;  
The Earth-Immortal, Supremely True, the Three Officials who preserve life, subtle and mysterious,  
Immeasurable in kindness, protecting with divine response, the True Lord;  
The Supreme Minister who administers Life in the Nine Heavens,  
The Three Maos, who manifest and respond, the Venerable Lord who preserves life in Heaven.
