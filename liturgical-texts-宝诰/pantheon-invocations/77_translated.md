# Precious Declaration of Wei Zu

With devoted heart I take refuge and submit reverence.  
The Primordial Sovereign unfolds transformation, the wondrous true body.  
Radiance like the full moon reveals a compassionate countenance;  
The pure and tranquil mysterious wind opens the orthodox teaching.  
The Dao honored and sacred Ancestor, virtue weighty as the Medicine King.  
He presides over the thunderbolts of the three realms,  
Registers the fortunes of all living beings.  
The Ancestor and Master, greatly compassionate and benevolent,  
The Celestial Illuminating Dharma King, Supreme Immortal of the Southern Mountain,  
The Commander of Destinies of the Nine Heavens,  
The Golden Palace Supreme Guardian,  
The High Original True Spirit, the Purple Void Primordial Lord.
