# Precious Declaration of the Primordial Lord Ancestor

With devoted heart I pay my vows and obeisance. The Primordial Origin begins the transformation of breath, pure and subtle, the orthodox ancestral source. Vast and lofty, bright and clear, the awakened heart is complete in the essence of the Way. Firm and vigorous, pure and unmixed, the nature is endowed by the spirits divine. It brings down thunder and lightning within the midst of non-action, enfolds heaven and earth beyond all visible form. The supreme utmost beyond all supreme, it gathers the true sources of the four schools. Mysterious beyond mystery, it partakes of the wondrous meanings of the Three Vehicles. It unfolds and exalts the great teaching, to benefit and deliver all living things. It shines through the palace, the pure subtle ancestral master; the unsurpassed attendant of the imperial throne, illustrious and resplendent in the golden gates. The wondrous Way guards the immortals, the transformation connects with the single radiance â€” the Primordial Lord Ancestor.
