# The Precious Edict of the Heavenly Sovereign

With devoted heart and reverent bow I pay homage.  
The Purple Tenuity, the Imperial Pole, the Heavenly Palace of Gou Chen.  
Within the Nine Radiancesâ€™ Precious Garden, above the Mysterious Metropolis of the Five Qi.  
The Essence is the Primal Sovereign, assisting and directing the Mysterious Transformations;  
Presiding over the Two Poles, jointly ordering the Three Powers.  
He holds the balance of arms and chariots, widely extending great virtue;  
He governs the courses and ranks of the stars, without failing the constant ordinance.  
His image is lofty and majestic, his true essence vast and boundless.  
Of great compassion and great vow, greatly holy and greatly kind,  
The Heavenly Sovereign Supreme Emperor of the Upper Palace of Gou Chen.
