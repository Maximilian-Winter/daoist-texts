# The Precious Admonition of Wenshi

With reverent heart I submit myself in homage and obedience. In the age of Zhou there was a perfect man, the Prefect of Hangu Pass. From youth he studied the ancient tombs and sought their records, and in his younger days he practised the Simple and the Easy. He was able to penetrate and elucidate the celestial writings and secret records, and skilful in discerning the transformations of Yin and Yang. In Yong Province, at Zhongnan, he built a humble grass-thatched tower. There he clearly observed the stars and constellations, and comprehended the eternal Way. He welcomed the purple vapour that came from the East, the holy man, and met the Great Origin who imparted the scriptures and methods. The tower and hermitage conveyed the teachings to five thousand. The true source of myriad methods is profound beyond measure. He founded the sect and took the name Wenshi, recorded in the annals of Zhou as the Prefect Yin Yi. Of great compassion and great vow, of great holiness and great mercy. The Jade Pure High Minister, the True Lord Wenshi. The Golden Sun Ancient Broad Benefactor, World-Opening and Enlightening Heavenly Venerable.
