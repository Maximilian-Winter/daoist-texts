# The Precious Edict of the Primordial Lady Mago

With a heart devoted and a life surrendered, I pay reverent homage.  
Perfectly penetrating, profound and silent, abiding steadfastly in benevolence and compassion.  
On Mount Kunlun she manifests her wondrous form;  
In the caves of Qingcheng she reveals her sacred deeds.  
Passing through Wu and crossing Cai, she answers kindly and responds with sincerity;  
Casting rice that becomes elixir, she ever delights in play and transformation.  
She presides over the chief of the host of immortals,  
Enfolding all the myriad assemblies within her embrace.  
Refining the body through the nine harmonies, transcendingåŠŸ to the ten extremes.  
Great compassion and great vow, great holiness and great mercy,  
The True and Silent Mago, who responds with purity, blesses and aids most wondrously, the Primordial Lady.
