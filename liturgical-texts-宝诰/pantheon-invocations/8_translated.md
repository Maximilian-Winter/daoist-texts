# Decree of the Lord of the Stars

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
Great Luo Heavenâ€™s Gate, the Purple Tenuity Star Palace.  
Exalted is the dwelling on the loftiest North Pole,  
Its station fixed above the central heaven.  
The Dharma name is Golden Wheel of Intense Flame,  
The Way is styled Jade Dipper, Profound Venerable.  
The Heavenly Pivot and Jade Balance govern the seven rulers alike;  
They sum up the celestial scriptures and the terrestrial laws,  
They weave the sun and moon in their courses.  
The stars and mansions are arranged, the four seasons proceed;  
The Yellow Path and Purple Enclosure, masters of myriad phenomena,  
Commanders of the myriad heavens.  
Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy,  
Master of ten thousand stars, the Limitless Primordial Sovereign,  
The Central Heaven Purple Tenuity Northern Pole Great Emperor.
