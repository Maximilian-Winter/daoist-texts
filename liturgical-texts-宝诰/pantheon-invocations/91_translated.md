# The Precious Edict of the Perfected One Who Penetrates Emptiness and Communes with the Subtle

With devoted mind and reverent obeisance I submit myself. On high, in the divine firmament, in the Jade Purity and Thunder Mansion;  
Light is divided from the One Qi, summoning forth the noble peaks;  
The Way moves through the five phases, attending the imperial secret temple.  
In the palm are thunder and rain, to relieve drought and dispel calamity;  
With a finger he commands the yin emotions, to pacify the realm and protect the state.  
HisåŠŸ (merit) is equal to countless kalpas, he is the ancestral teacher of doctrine.  
His virtue aids the wandering multitude, the compassionate father of all beings:  
The Perfected One who penetrates Emptiness and communes with the Subtle, the Spiritual and Wise True Lord.
