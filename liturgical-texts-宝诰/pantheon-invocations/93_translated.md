# The Precious Decree of Master Sa

With utmost sincerity I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
His lineage flows to the Western lands; his traces manifest the dragon’s rise.  
He bestows wealth and combines medicines to succour all living beings;  
Accumulating deeds and merits, cultivating the perfect Way.  
Receiving the teachings and instructions of the Iron Master,  
He holds in his charge the Thunder Writings of the Jade Palace.  
His body is clad in a robe of a hundred patches that subdues demons;  
His hand wields the Fan of the Five Luminaries to bring down ghosts.  
He proclaims and transforms by Heaven’s mandate, chanting incantations, inscribing talismans,  
Commanding wind and thunder within a span of a hand’s breadth;  
He cuts down demons and monsters beneath the Dipper and the Gang stars.  
The Way partakes in the Supreme Ultimate, his rank among the Primordial Heaven,  
Like pine, bamboo, wild cranes, he roams at will,  
A solitary cloud from far or near, ever in freedom.  
Everywhere he expounds the Teaching, the master of all the myriad laws;  
At every place he opens a platform, a model for those who come after.  
The chief of the Congregation of Heaven,  
The Supreme and Unrivalled Sa Elder, the True Lord.
