# Precious Injunctions of the Patriarch Sanfeng

With reverent heart I take refuge and pay homage.  
Beginning with the Azure One Qi, his teaching extends to the ten quarters.  
He accumulates merits and honours in the great brightness,  
And delivers all living beings in the market-place.  
Meeting the Fire Dragon, he carefully attained the Supreme Way;  
Entering Wudang, he nurtured and nourished the Spirit of the Valley.  
He mingled with the world, harmonizing and shining,  
Governing the five cycles in order;  
He entered the mountains and faced the wall,  
Undergoing trials for nine years.  
At the great court he was honoured with the imperial carriage and manifest ascension;  
On famous mountains and ancient caves remain traces of the immortal.  
Everywhere he opened enlightenment; everywhere he established altars.  
He expounded the Golden Laws, transmitted for ten thousand generations,  
And proved the Golden Elixir to deliver all later disciples.  
Great compassion, great vow;  
Great mercy, great benevolence;  
Utmost spirit, utmost holiness;  
Utmost impartiality, utmost clarity.  
The myriad spirits in unity of originâ€”  
The Primordial Ancestor, the True Lord of Great Mercy and Universal Salvation,  
The Celestial Venerable who penetrates the subtle and manifests the manifest.
