# Precious Memorial of the Five Patriarchs of Quanzhen

With heart devoted and mind reverent I submit myself in homage. The Great Way opened at the beginning, the Mysterious Origin proclaimed transformation. The teaching has been transmitted from ancient times until now, revealing the title of Eastern Flower. It connects with the generals of the Han court, concealing itself in Zhongnan to enter the immortal pact. Transcending the cycles of kalpas in its transformations, it manifests ever present in the human world. It enlightened the sages of the Tang dynasty, awakening the secret methods of the spirits and immortals. Flying swords and medicinal wares admonish and transform without limit. The lofty standard of the Golden Court Prime Minister, the valiant decisiveness of the treasured seal’s command. Ascending in clouds of rosy hue, uniting the north and south lineages. Heaven again rises among men of prowess, the Way passes freely through the four seas. The seven blossoms of the golden lotus unfold, disseminating the immortal school across the ten directions. The principle of longevity is extended to the present, ineffable Heaven descends upon all lands. Vast and magnificent is the Supreme Way, widely delivering the foolish and deluded. The Quanzhen Patriarch Masters: Eastern Flower of the Purple Mansion assisting the Mysterious and establishing the Supreme Way Emperor Sovereign; Proper Yang awakening and transmitting the Way to the ultimate Emperor Sovereign; Pure Yang manifesting the right and admonishing, the Faithful Protector Emperor Sovereign; Sea Toad enlightened and spreading the Way, the Pure Protector Emperor Sovereign; Chongyang Quanzhen opening transformation and assisting the supreme Emperor Sovereign — the Five Patriarchs expounding the Way, the Celestial Venerables.
