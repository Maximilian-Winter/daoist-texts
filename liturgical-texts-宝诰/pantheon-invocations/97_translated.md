With reverent heart I bow and submit my life in homage.  
Illumined in the true, attaining the path authenticated, he practised transformation in the Southern Heaven.  
The Nine Sovereigns descended in footprints upon Tiantai, a single lineage deeply communicated through the Ancestor Liu.  
Gathering the immortal marvels of the Jade-like Blossoms, he wrote the cinnabar scriptures of awakening to the truth.  
The Way was entrusted to the apricot grove; anon were the collections of the chapters of Returning to the Origin;  
The Law passed through the Cock’s Foot Mountain, there the book of the cinnabar marrow was completed.  
The Perfected Man emerged prominently in Huizhou, his nature and ground awakened, transcending spirit and excellence;  
With blade and jade tube entering the mouth, his divine transformation was boundless.  
He wielded thunder and rain in the palm of his hand, reviving the life of the people beyond the world.  
His virtue shone forth in the Southern Sea, attaining the essence and standard of jade;  
The Way pervaded the distant wilderness, satiated with the spirit and subtlety of the Law’s words.  
The traces of Dragon and Tiger floated upon Luo, the region of Wuyi and Jade Ridge;  
Passing through many transformations, the true writings are fully set forth, the foremost crown of the divine immortals, gathering the models of former generations.  
Vowing to extend profoundly, compassionate and benevolent is the holy Ancestor and Master:  
The Perfected True Zi-Yang, the Perfected Apricot Grove Cui-Xuan, the Perfected Way-Illumined Zi-Xian,  
The Perfected Mud Pellet Cui-Xu, the Perfected Jade Pipe Zi-Qing.
