# Precious Edict of Mazu

With devoted heart I take refuge and pay my reverent obeisance.  
The Motherâ€™s model is matched by the earth; her sacred virtue reaches to the heavens.  
She penetrates the mysterious and numinous body; silently serene, a spirit immortal.  
In the province of Min her mighty power shines forth; on Meizhou her beneficence flows without end.  
The yang spirit ever manifests, to save the world and extend compassion.  
Repeatedly she stirs the transformation of the ancient rites; evermore she exemplifies the profound learning of the Way.  
Embracing mercy and pity, she upholds the distressed and aids those in need;  
She extends shelter to the hidden and widely saves those bound by good affinities.  
Her sacred virtue abides in the waters; her wondrous law is the great support.  
Utterly chaste and pure, without partiality or bias.  
She heeds the voice to rescue the afflicted and relieve calamities;  
Following the heart, she dispels misfortune and removes transgressions.  
Great pity and great vow; great saint and great compassion.  
The Jade-sealed Queen of Heaven, the Heavenly Holy Mother, the Original Sovereign.
