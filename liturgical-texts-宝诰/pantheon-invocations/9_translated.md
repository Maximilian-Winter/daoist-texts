# Sacred Proclamation of the Queen of the Earth

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
The Nine Glorious Jade Palaces, the Seven Treasured Imperial Chambers.  
Receiving the mandate of Heaven at the appointed time,  
She governs Yin and holds the sceptre of Yang.  
The Way extols her honour and embraces her vast and radiant splendour;  
Virtue is accumulated in gentleness, compliance, benefit, and steadfastness.  
Imitating the Vast Heaven, she is the root and origin nurturing the perfection of Earth;  
She flows through forms and things, giving birth and bestowing the benevolence of the Maternal Way.  
Mountains and rivers depend upon her, all hills and streams bow before her.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy;  
Bearing Heavenâ€™s example, the Queen of the Earth, sovereign spirit of the land.
