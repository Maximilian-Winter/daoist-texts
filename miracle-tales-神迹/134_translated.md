# Luo Weiying of Quanzhou: Her Sorrowful Indignation Moving Heaven

Luo Weiying was a native of Quanzhou. In the year 1988 she was married to a man surnamed Hu, and they begot a son. When the child was but thirty days old, the man Hu departed to go abroad to Malaya. Before his going he said unto Luo Weiying, "Thou shalt remain at home and duly bring up the child. In two years I will fetch thee and thy mother abroad." But thirteen years passed in waiting, and Luo Weiying bore alone the burden of the child-rearing, tasting hardships and bitterness, known only to herself.

In the year 2000, Luo Weiying purchased a house, but she had not the money at hand. In her distress she journeyed to Mount Wuyi â€” partly to refresh her mind, partly to pay homage to the Ancestor Master. When she returned, she had but two hundred yuan on her person. On the morrow a friend promised to lend her fifty thousand yuan; and Luo Weiying borrowed more than a hundred thousand yuan from other sources, and so at last the money for the house was secured. Her husband's family, hearing of this, feared that the house might be taken from her by others, and sent her more than fifty thousand yuan.

When the house was registered in the property records, she also inscribed the name of the man Hu thereon, hoping that one day he might return. Yet when she called him, he bade her wait yet two years more. But Luo Weiying could no longer endure the waiting; despairing, she oftentimes made a disturbance at the Hu household, smashing the refrigerator and the gas stove. The family was troubled. At length, in the year 2009, the two were reconciled to divorce. On the very day the decree of divorce was given, as Luo Weiying passed forth from the court, she said unto the family Hu, "After so many years of marriage, I have never done aught to wrong your house. Men act, but Heaven sees. If Heaven have eyes, your whole family shall receive retribution!" On the morrow the mother of the man Hu fell from the upper storey, breaking her thigh, which thereafter began to rot.

Afterwards, Luo Weiying's son went abroad to work. She deemed that the spirits of Mount Wuyi had ever protected her, and so she became a Daoist priest at Mount Wuyi.

It is said:  
Betrayed by a heart untrue, the lament is for the lack of fate;  
If fate be lacking, why then linger yet?  
Though the retribution visit the Hu mother, it cannot compensate for one or two years of youth.
