# Retribution upon the Contractor of the Life-Release Pond at Mount Nan Yue

Li Dinggui was a man of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang. His nature was cunning and sly. Observing the prosperity of incense offerings in the temples of the scenic region, and understanding the Chinese fondness for seeking the protection of the gods, Li Dinggui conceived that there was a great opportunity therein. He therefore endeavoured to engage in the business of contracting temples, and reaped considerable profit.

In the year 2001, he rented a stall by the life-release pond of a certain temple at Mount Nan Yue, where he sold fish and turtles for the use of devotees who purchased them for release. By day Li Dinggui sold these fish and turtles to the devotees; by night, when the scenic place was without visitors, he would take up the fish and turtles again, that on the morrow he might sell them anew for life-release. Thus he proceeded by repeated cycles, gaining continual profit.

Pleased with his own craftiness, and unbelieving in the gods and the retribution of deeds, in the year 2003, while riding a motorcycle, he fell into a river and was drowned. His family sought men to recover the body, but only after more than ten days did the corpse rise up in the upper reaches of the river, already devoured to a great part by fish and turtles.

It is said: 'He who believes not in cause and effect, nor fears Heaven, profits well beneath the feet of the Patriarchs; little knowing that blessings and honours are dispersed in shadow; when the day of retribution comes, death shall fill his destiny.'
