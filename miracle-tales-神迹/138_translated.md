# The Affair of Guan Gong's Possession in Hainan

Wu Jun was a man of Hainan. His parents were divorced, and Wu Jun having but just finished the middle class did not complete his studies; afterwards he drifted about in society, becoming a petty ruffian, fighting and making disturbances everywhere. But Wu Jun was very loyal to friendship, treating his friends with sincerity, opposing the strong and supporting the weak, delighting in redressing wrongs. He often said to those about him, 'The deity whom I most reverence is Guan Gong.'

In the year 2009, a kinsman of Wu Jun passed away, and Wu Jun went to attend the funeral. The funeral was held in the ancestral hall, and at that time the bereaved family had invited a company of Taoist priests to recite scriptures for the redemption of the soul. As Wu Jun listened to the priests chanting, he was deeply moved, and tears flowed down his cheeks in his emotion. Upon the altar was enshrined a statue of the guardian deity Guan Gong, with a red face and long beard, majestic and awe-inspiring. Wu Jun fixed his gaze upon Guan Gong, when suddenly a flash of lightning passed by, and he fainted.

Those present were all greatly alarmed, and hastened to support him, pressing his philtrum and giving him warm ginger soup to drink. Suddenly Wu Jun opened his eyes, standing upon one foot with the other leg crossed like a lotus posture. His right hand was as if stroking his beard, and he said, 'I am Han Shouting Marquis Guan Yun Chang.' When these words were uttered, he rushed to take the ceremonial arms in the ancestral hall, seizing the crescent-moon blade and began to wield it in a vigorous and spirited manner. Those present looked on stupefied.

The faith in Hainan is deep-rooted; the elders there understood that this was Guan Gong possessing him, and quickly knelt down to prostrate themselves in worship. About the time of one incense stick’s burning passed, Wu Jun recovered his senses. The Taoist priests said, 'Just now Guan Gong entered your body; perchance you have a predestined affinity with him. You may consult the divination to inquire further.' Wu Jun consecutively cast eighteen sacred lots, and made a covenant with Guan Gong. Guan Gong, by means of possession, expelled evil and cured afflictions, aiding the world, that men might know to reverence the spirits. Wu Jun, through the possession, earned some wealth and accumulated merit.

Wu Jun relied upon the power of Guan Gong; his dispelling of evil was very efficacious, so that people from the neighbourhood came to seek him. His family circumstances gradually improved.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says: 'The Heavenly Altar Jade Rules declare: The Supreme Perfect One does not attach to human bodies. The true gods will not possess men. But the Lingguan Edict says: Possession by spirit, the perfect illumination communicating the meaning. The Lingguan is one who can possess. From ancient times the affair of possession has been frequent; it is recorded in books, and handed down among the people. Perhaps that which possessed Wu Jun was not Guan Gong himself, but this story is recorded to tell men that there exist spiritual beings unknown to us in the dark. Are they ghosts? Are they gods?'

The eulogy says: 'Loyal beyond the clouds is Guan Yun Chang; demons and fiends, seeing him, tremble with fear. Sometimes possessing a man’s body to save from suffering, still recalling the day when he beheaded Yan Liang?'
