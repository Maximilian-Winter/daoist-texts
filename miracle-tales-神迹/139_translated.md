# The Veneration of the Worthy Qiao of Dongguan at Mount Chisong and the Manifestation of its Spirit

Qiao Huifang, a native of Dongguan, was one who possessed spiritual insight and was also a cultivator of the Way, able to behold things of the spirit realm. In the year 2009, she went to pay homage at Mount Chisong in Jinhua, to worship the Venerable Ancestor Huang. It chanced to be the sacred birthday of the Ancestor, and the Taoist priests of Chisong Palace were performing their ritual ceremonies. Qiao Huifang beheld the military array of the celestial court descend in grand procession from the heavens. The Venerable Ancestor Huang shone with golden light, his divine image solemn and august.

Qiao Huifang had a son, weak and frequently ill; she knelt and earnestly prayed that the Ancestor would protect and bless her child, so that he might grow up in health. The Ancestor said, ‘At present my temple is undergoing repairs, and a sum of money is needed.’ Qiao Huifang entered the hall and saw that the temple was to erect a theatre stage, but some funds yet lacked. Knowing the response to be from the Venerable Ancestor, she generously gave ten thousand taels of silver. Upon returning home, the child dreamed that an immortal bestowed upon him a talisman, bidding him to wear it. Since that time, his health was restored, and in all respects he prospered.
