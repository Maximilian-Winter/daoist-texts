# The Matter of the Enchantress Prohibited by the Wudang Taoist

Zhao Sixuan, a Daoist Master, in his early years renounced the world and entered Wudang, inheriting the lineage of the Heavenly Heart Method. Afterwards he wandered through famous mountains such as Qingcheng and Wuyi, seeking out exalted sages and extraordinary persons. In the year 2009 he took up residence in Xiamen, where he built a humble hut and diligently cultivated the Way by burning incense. A benevolent lay devotee, seeing him, generously supported and protected him; not long after, a small Taoist temple was erected. Because Master Zhao had taken vows in Wudang, this temple chiefly worships the True Warrior Great Emperor, and is named the Xuantian Temple.

In Minnan there is a fondness for licentious rites, and mediums and enchantresses are especially numerous. There was one enchantress who often went to the temple to perform her ecstatic spirit dances, muttering confused words, disturbing the stillness; many admonitions were made, but to no avail. In the eighth month of the year 2012, Daoist friend Lin Farun visited the Way in Minnan, lodging at the Xuantian Temple. While drinking tea and conversing freely with Master Zhao, they heard from the courtyard of the temple the murmuring chantings, unintelligible even in Minnan dialect. Lin asked the Master what was the matter, who replied, ‘It is but an enchantress, she comes often; do not mind her.’ Lin said, ‘We today are seldom so favoured to meet and talk at leisure; how can we let this enchantress spoil our refined mood? This evil spirit dares to run riot in the temple; it is truly excessive. Let me invoke the divine generals and seize the possessed demon.’ Saying so, he took up the Tianpeng staff to exorcise the demon. Master Zhao quickly stopped him, saying, ‘Brother, no: the renunciant must bear compassion in his heart. Watch me.’ Master Zhao made the finger signs, drew upon the Qi of the Northern Dipper, and in the twinkling of an eye, outside the window all was suddenly silent. Lin said, ‘Ah, the enchantress has suddenly ceased her dancing; what is the cause?’ Zhao said, ‘Just now I took the Heavenly Dipper’s Great Qi to restrain her; the evil spirit, seeing it, was filled with fear and fled away.’

The two opened the window and said to the enchantress in the courtyard, ‘Why do you no longer dance? If you come again, I shall imprison that demon!’ The enchantress then understood that the Master, who had before only compassionately borne with her and not contended, was not powerless against her. Afterwards she came no more to the temple to perform her spirit dances.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: Generally, the spirits which possess are many mountain spirits and ghosts of strange kind. Possession and communication with spirits may also be for the purpose of cultivation; but if pride arises, and they make disorder in the temple, this is not good. Master Zeng restrained them by the Great Qi of the Heavenly Dipper, but this is a slight art only. Taoism also has the method of purifying the altar and establishing a boundary; the Nine Phoenixes and the General who Dispels Filth are invited to sweep away the defilement, and the great spirit officers are requested to guard the altar; thus evil demons and heterodox paths dare not approach. There is also the method of beheading the divining officer and establishing a prison, by which the evil spirits may be tightly confined.
