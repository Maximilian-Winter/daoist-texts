# The Verification of Holding the Sacred Name of the Compassionate Savior by Wang Tingzhi of Ganzhou

Wang Tingzhi was a native of Ganzhou. In his early years he frequented the Jade Void Temple, offering incense and paying homage to the sacred image of the Compassionate Heavenly Venerable who Saves from Suffering; his heart gave rise to faith and reverence, and he continuously recited the sacred name without ceasing. Others laughed at him, but Wang Tingzhi only smiled faintly in return.  

In the twentieth year of the Republic, when the flames of war broke out fiercely, Wang Tingzhi could not escape, and was struck by a stray bullet in midstream, falling to the ground.  

In a state of stupefaction, he perceived ghostly messengers come to take his life, and he was borne to the netherworld of Fengdu. Beneath the yellow earth, damp and dark, there occasionally appeared one or two ghost-fires, flickering and passing by. At times, there came the sounds of tortures and interrogations.  

Moved with compassion for the beings suffering in hell, Wang repeated once the phrase, "Taiyi Saves from Suffering Heavenly Venerable." Suddenly, the gloom dispersed, and he beheld the Heavenly Venerable riding upon five-coloured auspicious clouds, mounted upon a nine-headed lion, with every step causing lotus flowers to sprout; his voice resounded through the netherworld. Mighty warriors went before, and celestial enforcers followed behind; jade maidens and golden youths bore countless banners.  

Seeing this, Wang Tingzhi’s heart was filled with reverence, and he prostrated himself upon the ground. Joyful and praising, he beheld the venerable one’s majestic and wondrous appearance. In an instant, hell vanished; evil spirits fled and hid; the iron enclosure of eternal punishment was transformed into the celestial gardens and jade pools of the Isles of the Immortals. It was as if in a dream.  

Wang Tingzhi awoke, only to find himself lying in a coffin, to the terror of his family. At that time, Wang Tingzhi’s wife, a woman of great courage, inquired of the situation, saying: “Just now you were struck by a stray bullet; your heart ceased to beat and your breath was gone. We all thought you were dead.” Wang then recounted what he had dreamed. All concluded that it was the manifestation of the Compassionate Heavenly Venerable who Saves from Suffering that had saved Wang Tingzhi’s life. They hastened to offer incense and pay homage, in gratitude for the sacred benevolence.
