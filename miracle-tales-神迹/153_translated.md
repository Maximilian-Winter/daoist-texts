# The Efficacy of Li Ailian of Huzhou in Reciting the Holy Name of the Savior of Suffering

Li Ailian was a native of Huzhou. In her early years she followed the Pure Land sect of Buddhism, and never ceased reciting the Buddha's name.

In the year of Jiaxu, her family was haunted; the cupboards moved without any one near, and utensils and dishes made rustling sounds; sometimes in dreams strange apparitions appeared; electric lights flickered, portents of various ill omens. Several Buddhist lay disciples all urged her diligently to recite the holy name of Amitābha Buddha, to drive away these spectres. Yet, for three months, there was no effect. Li Ailian was filled with alarm, and so she sought counsel from a Daoist priest at the Smoke and Mist Temple of Huzhou, inquiring for a method of deliverance. The priest taught her to recite the holy name of the Heavenly Worthy Taiyi, the Savior from Suffering. Li Ailian consented readily, willing to observe the teaching.

Returning home, she sincerely recited the holy name of the Heavenly Worthy, without counting the number of times. That very night she dreamed that the Savior from Suffering rode upon a five-coloured auspicious cloud, mounted on a nine-headed lion. Immortal beings stood in homage and escort, banners and flags going before. Descending from Heaven, he took away all the spectres that haunted the house. From that time forth, no more apparitions disturbed the home. Thereupon Li Ailian turned to embrace the Daoist faith. In the year of Yichou she passed away; her body was soft and frail after death—this is the image of one who has been born into the Pure Land.
