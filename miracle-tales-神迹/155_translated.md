# The Vouchsafement of Zhou Juhua of Taiyuan in Offering to the Three Treasures

Zhou Juhua was a native of Taiyuan. Born in poverty and low estate, she held in reverence the Daoist teaching; yet her means were insufficient, which was ever a matter of regret. When at leisure, Zhou Juhua would frequently go to the temple to serve as a volunteer, or else she would make donations of rice, flour, bean-oil, and the like to the temple.

In the summer of the year 1983, Zhou Juhua felt the days of her life were few, and her body grew ever weaker. She thought to herself, that her poverty and low estate were decreed by the stars, and she bore no resentment towards others. Nevertheless, relying on the grace and protection of the Patriarch, her family enjoyed health and no misfortune. Yet the main hall of the Lüzu Palace in the town was without a dragon canopy; might she devise some means to donate one to the temple? But in the year 1983, the market economy was not yet well developed, and there were no embroidered dragon canopies like those now to be found in the market. Therefore Zhou Juhua procured a piece of red cloth at the market, and had a tailor make for her a simple dragon canopy, which she then presented in front of the image of Lüzu in the Lüzu Palace. Before long, Zhou Juhua passed away, aged and ill; at her death her countenance was peaceful.

After the funeral, Zhou’s daughter, who had married far away, dreamed that Zhou Juhua was conducted by a red-robed boy attendant to the Heavenly Palace. Wondering at this, when she returned home for the New Year, she told her elder brother of the dream, asking what it might mean. Her brother was also uncertain. Later, when burning incense at the Lüzu Palace, they found that the boy attendant standing by Lüzu’s side was exactly like the one in the dream. And on the dragon canopy before Lüzu was inscribed, though crookedly, the words: "Faithful Devotee Zhou Juhua reverently offers." Thus they knew that their mother, by this solemn act of merit, had received Lüzu’s guidance and was born into the Pure Land.

The Scripture of the Forty-Nine Chapters of the Venerable Xu Huang says: "One who has no field of blessing in the world, upon closing his eyes, on what can he rely?" The Buddhists say: "All things cannot be carried away, only karma follows the person." Though Zhou Juhua was born poor and destitute, by this utmost sincerity and merit she did not fall into the evil realms. Shall we who pursue the Way not be thereby warned?
