# The Record of the Immortal Ascension of Master Xie Xichun of Tiantai

Xie Xichun was a Taoist of Tiantai. In his early years he entered the Minghe Temple on Tiantai to cultivate the Way; his ancient resolve never wavered, and his reverent heart grew ever firmer. He obtained the true transmission of the Southern School, and his功力 was profound, so that he could practise embryo breathing and conceal his qi. In Hangzhou, when tested by the electrocardiogram, in a moment the electrocardiogram became a straight line, and the physicians were all amazed, yet Master Xie remained calm and self-possessed. This is the method of embryo breathing, which can cause the heart-beat and respiration to cease, yet life is not ended. This matter is known to all the seniors of the Taoist world.

After the Laojun Assembly in the year '84, a Taoist named Ma Sizhen, from Jinhua, journeyed to Tiantai to make pilgrimage. Passing through the Yousheng Palace at Linhai, he met a Daoist clad in hemp garments, shod with straw sandals, and wearing a Qingguan cap; his attire was unlike that of ordinary Taoists, and his bearing was composed. He spoke to Ma Sizhen: 'Fellow Daoist, do you intend to go to Tiantai?' Ma answered, 'Yes; I am about to go to Tiantai to pay homage.' The Daoist said, 'Would you be so kind as to carry a letter to Master Xie Xichun?' Ma Sizhen consented; the Daoist thanked him and departed.

On the morrow, Ma Sizhen ascended Mount Tiantai. At that time the ways were inconvenient, and he arrived at night. He paid respects to Master Xie Xichun. When Xie the Daoist saw the letter, he laughed heartily, saying, 'It is well that my master still remembers me.' Ma Sizhen was somewhat perplexed and took no serious heed; he dallied awhile on Tiantai, then set out to return to Jinhua.

Meanwhile Master Xie Xichun gave orders concerning certain affairs within the temple. He bathed and burned incense, and went to the Round Hall to sit in quiet; he left only a few disciples near him. About the third watch of the night, there was heard within the Round Hall a faint sound of thunder, and the earth trembled. There was seen white vapour issuing from the Mud Pellet (the crown of the head), and in a moment at the top of his head a baby was formed, shaped like a man, clear as snow and moonlight, radiant and lovely. Soon the infant mounted a celestial crane and departed!

Later, Ma Sizhen at Red Pine Mountain of Jinhua again saw Xie Xichun, who taught him the formulae of internal cultivation. A fellow Daoist came from Linhai and spoke with Ma Sizhen of the Master’s feathered ascent. Ma Sizhen said, 'Impossible! Only a few days ago he was here instructing me in the methods of the elixir!' It was then known that the Real Person manifested himself to instruct and save men by expedient means. Ma Sizhen earnestly practised internal cultivation, and in the early nineties he repaired to Mount Hua to cultivate the Way; thereafter his fate was unknown.
