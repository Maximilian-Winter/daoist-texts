# The Verification of Seeking Wealth by the Merchants of Wenling through the Pure Sacrifice

Mr. Zhou Aihua was an ordinary merchant of Wenling City in Taizhou, Zhejiang. His family conducted a hardware factory, and the business was fairly prosperous. But in recent years, he felt the trade grew more and more difficult. Seeing others’ factories prospering and earning, yet his own receiving few orders, his heart was consumed with anxiety. Many geomancers (feng shui masters) were consulted, but their effects were not manifest.

In Zhejiang, the local people all believe in the Daoist teaching. Zhou Aihua dwelt at Zhanglaoqiao, under the protection of the Zi Yun Palace. At the Lao Jun Assembly of 2012, Zhou Aihua came to Zi Yun Palace to pray for blessings, where he chanced to meet the Daoist priest Xu Haibin from Qionglong Mountain of Suzhou. In casual talk, he spoke of his own trade.

Daoist Xu asked, “What is your sign?” He answered, “Born in 1976, the year of the Dragon.”

“The Dragon sign, in the year 2011, Xinmao, there was harm between Chen and Mao—unfavourable; in 2012, Renchen year, Chen conflicted with itself—also unfavourable. Next year, Guisi, things will improve. Yet there is still one point you must take heed of.” Zhou Aihua quickly asked, “What else must I beware, Master?”

Daoist Xu said, “Man’s blessings come from several aspects: first, what the Buddhists call the cause and effect of past lives; second, the virtue accumulated by one’s ancestors; third, one’s own accumulation of virtue. Whosoever accumulates virtue and practises good deeds, his blessings and prosperity are great; whosoever commits sins and does evil, his blessings are scant. In this world, men mostly indulge their ignorant nature, harbouring greed, anger, jealousy; they speak ill of others, disparage the Dao, separate kin, steal, and commit licentious acts—many evil deeds which secretly diminish their own blessings. Looking upon your visage, your heavenly court (forehead) is full and ample, indicating your ancestors were a family of accumulated goodness. But now your business fares so poorly, the cause thereof you yourself should understand.”

These words caused Zhou Aihua to break out in a sweat, and he bowed his head, entreating, “How may I lessen my transgressions?”

Daoist Xu said, “In the human body dwell three corpses (san shi), who on the days of Gengshen and Jiazi each month report a man’s sins to Heaven. The heavenly court has special gods who adjudicate the crimes and virtues of men, to determine their calamities and fortune. Yet the Heavenly Lord is merciful, and has opened the path of repentance, giving men a way to renew themselves. If one can sincerely repent of his sins, cut off the root of evil, and generate good thoughts, then past sins may be pardoned. Sin arises from the heart, and likewise is extinguished by the heart. If one can truly repent and return the heart to goodness, sins vanish and blessings grow. Know then that the root of sin is the root of calamity, and a heart of virtue is the field of blessings.”

Thus Zhou Aihua worshipped and entreated Daoist Xu to establish a ritual of repentance and prayer for blessings, submitting a memorial to the Three Officials Emperors and the Eastern Peak Heavenly Sovereign, to remove his name from the black register. With true heart he repented, only wishing henceforth to do more good deeds. Zhou Aihua not only gave wealth to support the Three Treasures and the construction of the Xuantan Temple, but also aided poor children of society in their studies, performing many good works. Now his factory’s business flourishes, and orders must be fulfilled into the following year. The Ancestor said: “The house that accumulates goodness shall surely have abundant felicity; the house that accumulates evil shall surely have abundant calamity.” The Way of Heaven is clear and manifest; retribution is unerring.
