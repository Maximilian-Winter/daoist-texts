# The Efficacy and Manifest Response of the Ritual of Fighting the Stars at the Sanqing Palace of Jinhua

The Sanqing Palace of Jinhua city is situated on Jingxiao Street in Wucheng district; it is an ancient temple of a thousand years. In the gengyin year, on the fifteenth day of the second month, when the assembly of the Venerable Lord was held, a fasting and offering ceremony was conducted to celebrate the birthday of the Venerable Lord, praying for the peace of the state and the safety of the people, and for timely harmony and a bountiful year. At that time the chief officiant of the altar was Master Wang Lehe of the Chisong sect; the ritual meeting lasted three days. On the night of the fourteenth day of the second month, the ceremony of fighting the stars was performed. Prostrate, they chanted the "True Scripture of the Supreme Mysterious Spirit of the Northern Dipper for Prolonging Life by the Original Fate," paying homage to the holy titles of the Star Lords, and beseeching an explanation of the twenty-four calamities.

At that time the ritual platform of the Sanqing Palace was solemn; the lamps and candles shone brightly, the sound of the scriptures resounded to the clouds, and the bells and drums were splendid. The ritual of fighting the stars was completed; outside the door the stars and moon shone brightly, and a clear breeze blew in gusts. At that moment a female devotee, able to communicate with the spirit-world, joyfully told Daoist Wang, saying, "Daoist Wang, see how many immortals there are in the sky." Daoist Wang only perceived faintly amidst the clouds and sky the splendid courts and troops, numbering in the hundreds of thousands; some wielded axes and halberds, others held magnificent banners; auspicious clouds wreathed about, and purple vapours filled the skies. The Star Lords descended to the altar, bestowing blessings and resolving calamities, witnessing and confirming the merits of the oath. When asked, others said they had seen nothing. From that time onwards, this female lay devotee devoted herself wholeheartedly to Daoism, upholding the Daoist altar, and even now continues her cultivation in the Jinhua region.
