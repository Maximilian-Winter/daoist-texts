# The Record of Zhang Luoqing of Wenzhou Meeting an Immortal

Zhang Luoqing was a native of Wenzhou. In his earlier years he entered the religious life at the Dongyue Temple of Wenzhou. Afterwards he went to Beijing to study; but, through unwise friendships, he became entangled with many evil customs.

In one year, Zhang Luoqing returned from Beijing to Wenzhou. After chanting the scriptures in a small temple on Mount Yandang, he prepared to return to the Dongyue Temple. At that time it was already evening; the mountain paths were rugged, the stars and moon were dim, and he gradually lost his way. As he walked on, he saw before him a flickering light, and so he went to lodge there. The house was small, such as are often found in the country — a tiled cottage. Within the courtyard, an old man was writing. The old man’s beard and hair were snowy white, and his air was extraordinary. Zhang Daozhang did not dare to disturb him, but drew near to look on. He saw that the old man was writing the character “Dao,” his brushwork vigorous and full, as if practised. When he had finished one sheet, he placed it beside a basin of water. Zhang Daozhang could not help exclaiming, “It is wet, it is wet; the Dao is wetted away!” The old man turned to Zhang Chengqing beside him and said, “Thou knowest that the Dao is lost, and yet why remainest thou here?” Zhang Daozhang, hearing these words full of subtle meaning, dared not speak. The old man went on, “For one who cultivateth the Dao, the precious thing is to persist in pure conduct; by no means should one follow the fashions of the vulgar world, or suffer the desires of the outside to disturb his mind and nature.” He further discoursed upon the inner elixir, the arts of divination, the stars and their courses; the old man answered readily and fully, knowing all things.

On the next day, Zhang Luoqing awoke to find himself sleeping in a wild and solitary place. Not far off lay the ruins of an ancient temple. He inquired of the local elders, and learned that this place was formerly the Palace of Lüzu.
