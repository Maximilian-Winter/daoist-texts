# Record of Encountering the Sword Immortal on Mount Qingcheng

Mount Qingcheng is the Fifth Grotto of Daoism, the chief among the Five Sacred Mountains, the place where spiritual energy is concentrated, and from whence arise many exalted sages and extraordinary persons. At the time of the earthquake in the year 512, great stones rolled down the mountain and trees were overturned, yet of the more than three thousand visitors and the Daoist priests residing on the mountain, not one was harmed or lost. The saying concerning the blessed lands of Daoist grottoes is by no means without foundation.

In the decade of the 1980s, the Daoist Guo Zhiqing of Zhejiang journeyed to Mount Qingcheng to pay homage, roaming the mountains and waters with great delight. Arriving at the Quanzhen Temple, he found within it a tea shop, where an elderly Daoist woman kept watch, most hospitable, saying, “Fellow Daoist, whence do you come? Pray take a cup of tea.” After Guo Zhiqing had worshipped at several halls of the Quanzhen Temple, he returned to the tea shop to drink tea and chat at leisure. Suddenly, a flash of cold light shot past outside the temple. Guo the Daoist Master inquired, “Old practitioner, what was that light just now?” The old practitioner replied, “Since the Wei and Jin dynasties, there have been Sword Immortals on Mount Qingcheng, who dwell mostly in the rear mountains and are hard to be seen by common men. They are able to ride swords in flight, traversing ten thousand li in a day; from a thousand li away they can sever a man’s head. Yet those who cultivate swordsmanship are often of solitary and eccentric temper, their actions strange and incomprehensible.”

Guo Zhiqing had long heard that immortals dwelt on Mount Qingcheng. During the Cultural Revolution, the sound of wooden fish was often heard in the rear mountains, and when the Red Guards followed the sound, no figure could be found. Guo the Daoist Master resolved that this time upon Mount Qingcheng, he must surely meet the immortals. Thus, after worshipping at Quanzhen Temple, the Celestial Master’s Cave, and the Patriarch’s Hall, he set out for the rear mountains. At that time, there was yet no development for tourism, and the mountain paths were difficult to traverse. After traveling for a long while, no temple was in sight, and the sky was growing dark. Deep in the mountains, serpents and insects moved about, and the roar of a tiger shook the whole valley. Guo Zhiqing’s heart was seized with fear, not knowing what to do, somewhat regretting his coming to the rear mountains.

At that moment of terror, he heard a voice say, “Fellow Daoist, whence do you come?” Guo Zhiqing sought the source of the voice but saw no figure, only a white crane perched upon an ancient pine. Could it be that this white crane was speaking to me? Guo Zhiqing was a little perplexed. Then the white crane flew to his side and transformed into the form of a Daoist, clad in a blue cloth Daoist robe, with a crane cloak outside, wearing a crescent moon cap on his head, sandals of straw upon his feet, and grasping a three-foot sword in his hand. The Daoist bowed his head and said, “Fellow Daoist Guo, there is no need for doubt. We met just a few days ago while the sky was still bright.”

Guo said, “Pardon my dullness, but I do not recall where we met.” The Daoist said, “Have you forgotten the white light at Quanzhen Temple?” Guo said, “Could it be that you are the old practitioner?” The Daoist laughed heartily and said, “I am but a humble Daoist. Now, the rear mountains abound with fierce tigers and leopards; indeed, it is not a place for ordinary men. Yet Mount Qingcheng is governed by true immortals, and these tigers and leopards serve only as guardians of the grotto, harming not the good but devouring those who are wicked and malevolent. Thus the Red Guards of the Cultural Revolution dared not enter the rear mountains lightly, truly relying on the protection of these beasts.” Guo Zhiqing said, “So it is. I have heard that immortals dwell in the rear mountains, yet wondered if it be true or false.” The Daoist said, “Famous mountains and grottoes all have immortals abiding there. But where immortals dwell, there is another heaven, and one without the ‘True Image Chart of Mount Qingcheng’ cannot enter. Your destiny has not yet come; there will be further chances for you to visit. For now, I will escort you down the mountain.”

Before Guo Zhiqing could recover his senses, he felt clouds beneath his feet and a sudden cold wind arise; in the twinkling of an eye, he found himself at the gate of Qingyang Palace. Looking back, the Daoist he had just seen had already vanished without trace. Guo Zhiqing hurriedly burned incense and made three obeisances to Heaven. From that time forward he applied himself more diligently and earnestly to the practice of the Way, entering Mount Tiantai in the year 1998, after which he was no longer heard of.
