# The Test of the Iron Pillar at Hongzhou

The iron pillar of the octagonal well of the Wan Shou Palace in Hongzhou was cast by the worthy Lord Xu in former days. In the time of the Jin dynasty, in Yuzhang (now Nanchang in Jiangxi), a flood-dragon wrought havoc on the people, and the waters overflowed in fury. Lord Xu, who followed his master Wu Meng the Perfected, had learned the art of the orthodox One and the Three-Five swift steps of exorcism, by which he controlled the myriad spirits. From the well of Zhangzhou he pursued the flood-dragon, even to its emerging at the octagonal well. Lord Xu said to Wu Meng the Perfected, "Beneath this well is the lair of the flood-dragon; if no means be taken to restrain it, then once in three hundred years it will return forth, to harm living creatures. And who then shall subdue it?"

Therefore he set the spirits and demons to bring millions of catties of iron, which were cast into the octagonal well, some feet of it remaining exposed above the well, standing upright and firm, like a mighty pillar. Eight iron chains were fixed upon it, to bind and to hold fast the earth's veins. Since that time within the borders of Yuzhang no longer have there been strange and evil matters, nor the scourges of flood or drought. The worthy Lord warned, "Let those who come after not destroy this iron pillar, lest there be great floods again and evil spirits do mischief." The people of the place dared not move it.

When Yan Zuan was Governor of Jiangxi, he hearkened to the words of evil men, and sent men to dig up the iron pillar, preparing to break it. But as soon as work began, dark clouds gathered, thunder and lightning startled the region, and the waters of the Gan River rose, roaring with overwhelming might. Then indeed he believed in the manifest power of the spirit, and hastened to burn incense, to worship, and to bow down in apology.
