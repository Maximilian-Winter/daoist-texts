# The Lady of Lang in Hebei Recites the Sacred Name of the Thunder Ancestor and Thereby Feels the Response

The Lady of Lang, a native of Tangshan in Hebei, relates that one day her daughter was suddenly taken with a severe fever. She sought out a local sorceress, who said, "This is because in an empty house there is a black serpent. One day the black serpent was basking in the sun; your child happened to look inward through the door mirror, and was discovered by the black serpent. It then followed your child." The Lady of Lang was greatly distressed, and asked the sorceress if there was any method of deliverance. The sorceress said she was powerless to help. The Lady of Lang took the child to the hospital, but all the tests were normal; no cause for the fever could be found.

While giving the child antipyretic injections, the Lady of Lang sought remedies everywhere. Suddenly she remembered a friend of hers, a devout Daoist named Master Shen. She contacted Master Shen, related the whole matter, and inquired if he had any means of counteraction. Master Shen replied, "To draw talismans and catch ghosts — these I do not understand. But I recall that the Jade Pivot Scripture says: 'The Heavenly Venerable said: If a man sojourns, the black rats send demons, snakes and insects bring calamities; bricks and tiles are cast about, disturbing roosters and teasing dogs; invitations and offerings are made; shadows menace and dreams oppress; and there are thieves and robbers. They dare to take up their dwelling places and make nests, so that living men are bewildered. If the courtyard is left unclean, there are night howls upon the beams, daytime looks into the chamber, and oxen, horses, dogs, and swine suffer pestilence. Misfortunes befall the bones and flesh, disasters affect the offspring; lewd shrines and demon societies arise; factions carry on treacheries; mourners are frequent; funerary carriages succeed one another. But if this scripture is recited, even the spirits of ghosts are destroyed, and all beings are at peace.' You may try to recite the sacred name of the Nine Heavens' Responsive Original Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable; the Venerable's vow is profound, his might and virtue vast — it should have some effect." The Lady of Lang asked, "How long should I recite it?" Master Shen replied, "Until the fever subsides."

Thereupon the Lady of Lang truly began to recite the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, and after about twenty minutes, the child's fever abated. Thereafter the condition remained stable. Master Shen himself often recites the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, and for many years all has gone smoothly; deeply sensing the Heavenly Venerable's compassionate vow, he related this story to me. He earnestly exhorts the public to recite the illustrious and precious name of the Heavenly Venerable. (Many thanks to Master Shen for providing this material; may the Heavenly Venerable grant blessings, and may the Dao qi be universal!)

An Ode:

Grateful for the profound vow of the Heavenly Venerable,  
Compassionately unfolding the Law for all beings.  
Should any one utter the Venerable's name,  
Evil demons instantly vanish as smoke and dust.
