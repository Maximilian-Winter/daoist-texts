# The Daoist Physician Xu Jiayan of Mount Hua

Xu Jiayan was a Daoist of the Mount Hua school, skilled in the art of Chinese medicine. In the twenty-first year of the Republican era, he took monastic vows at the Maonü Cave on Mount Hua. His medical skills were consummate, and his virtue and art alike were held in high esteem. Those from near and far, afflicted with difficult and perplexing ailments, if they sought out Daoist Master Xu, found their troubles easily resolved, as if by a wondrous hand restoring life in spring.

In the year 1992, a lay devotee named Wang Jianjun of Beijing, admiring the profound spirit, gave up his employment and came to Maonü Cave upon Mount Hua, offering himself to the service of sweeping and cleansing, to support Daoist Master Xu Jiayan in his cultivation. He chopped wood, carried water, kindled fire, and prepared meals, never shrinking from toil; thus he continued for three years. In the spring of 1994, because the wind on the mountain was exceedingly strong, some tiles were shifted from the roof of the place where the Daoist Master and his companions dwelt. To prevent the house from leaking, Wang Jianjun resolved to ascend the roof to replace the tiles. Unluckily, he fell from the roof. At that time Daoist Master Xu was within, compounding medicines; hearing cries from outside the window, he came forth and saw Wang Jianjun fallen to the ground, unconscious.

Daoist Master Xu took from his gourd a single pill, dissolved it in water, and prayed before the image of the Patriarch. With his left hand he held the bowl, performing the secret hand sign of the Three Mountains; with his right hand, the sword sign, he traced several mysterious characters upon the water. Then he presented the medicated water to Wang Jianjun, who drank it down. About the time of one incense stick’s burning, Wang Jianjun regained consciousness. He related to Daoist Master Xu, "I just dreamed that a golden-armoured divine general entered my body and seized something away." Xu Jiayan said, "The immortals and perfected ones of Mount Hua gather here, and many spirits and demons are also present. Because your heart in these days has raised worldly thoughts, you have drawn the mountain spirits and demons to you. I have used the Ghost-Dispelling Pill to drive them away. Things of like sound respond to each other, and things of like breath seek each other. Henceforth you must diligently cultivate the virtuous path; then naturally the auspicious gods will protect you. If you again arise in vain imaginings, you must not remain long in this place." Thereafter Wang Jianjun served Daoist Master Xu with greater caution, and in his leisure hours sat in quiet meditation himself.

Though Daoist Master Xu used his medical art to save and aid the people, he did not neglect sitting in stillness and reciting the scriptures. Whenever he chanted the sutras in his thatched hut, the Tibetan mastiffs a li or more away would come and lie outside to listen; the tigers and leopards of the mountain were all subdued and feared him. Sometimes visitors to the mountain, seeing Daoist Master Xu's practice, wished to offer him support in money, but the Master always declined. In the spring of 2005, when over eighty years of age, Daoist Master Xu told Wang Jianjun, "I am going to Kunlun Mountain to cultivate; in a few days I shall depart." On the third day of the third lunar month, he left the mountain bearing a zither and a sword, and was never heard of again.

A eulogy says:  
Lord Xu longed for the Way and left the world,  
Dwelling in obscurity on Mount Hua for many springs.  
His medicine could strike demons — not vain words;  
Lightly he ascended Kunlun with zither and sword.
