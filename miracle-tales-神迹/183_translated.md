# The Account of Daoist Friend Jiang of Weiyu Mountain Returning to the True

Jiang Zhizhen was a Daoist priest of the Zhenwu Temple in Longxi. His discipline and conduct were strict and exacting, and he transmitted the Divine Thunder Method of the Heavenly Firmament. The Northwest is a region much plagued by wind and sand; on one occasion a great wind arose, driving sand and stones in wild flight, and uprooting even the great trees. A lay follower sent a letter to inform Jiang Zhizhen and urged him to withdraw for safety. At that time Jiang Zhizhen was burning incense and reciting the scriptures, and he paid no heed; he made the hand-signs and trod the magic circles. After half an hour, he came out and looked forth; the houses one zhang distant from the temple were all ruined, but the Zhenwu Temple alone had suffered no harm from the great wind. Jiang Zhizhen was slovenly in dress and careless in small matters. He often called himself an official general of the Thunder Division, who, having committed some fault, was demoted to practise cultivation among men.

In the year 1989 Jiang Zhizhen went to visit Weiyu Mountain. One day a Daoist friend on the mountain proposed that they should go to the Jinfo Palace on the rear hill to pay homage to the Patriarch. Jiang Zhizhen said, 'Since we are to pay homage to the Patriarch, I will change into new garments!' So he washed and combed himself, and put on new clothes: a pure yuan turban, cloud-patterned stockings, shoes, and a long robe, all new. Several Daoist friends ascended the mountain in talk and laughter. It was about the third month of the lunar calendar; on the way up, a light rain began to fall, and they took shelter in a small temple by the roadside. Suddenly Jiang Zhizhen said to the Daoist friends who accompanied him, 'Friends, I will go on ahead.' They found it strange, and said, 'It is raining outside; where will you go?' Before they had finished speaking, a clap of thunder fell from the sky, lightning flashed, and the thunder shook the mountain. Jiang Zhizhen had already undergone apotheosis; the two Daoist friends who accompanied him were stunned by the thunder.

Another Daoist friend who was with them said, 'At that moment I saw the hand of the Thunder Lord, like a chicken’s claw, reaching out to seize me, but then it withdrew.' Afterwards they buried Daoist Friend Jiang in the temple. When changing his clothes, they found on his chest a black mark, somewhat like a crow.

The Iron-crowned Daoist said: 'In the Tang dynasty, Li Yuanba was renowned for his unmatched valour; it is said he was the reincarnation of a general of the Thunder Division, who was later recalled by the Thunder Division. Daoist Master Jiang Zhizhen was endowed with outstanding gifts and profound cultivation; it is thought that he has now returned to the True. Moreover, in reading the Daoist scriptures, the crow is the messenger of the Thunder Division; the mark on Daoist Master Jiang’s chest should be the sign left by the messenger of the Thunder Division.'
