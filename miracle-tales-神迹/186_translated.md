# The Story of Wu of Beijing, Who Reviled the Scriptures and Teachings

Wu, a man of Beijing, was fond of commenting upon the classics, and was self-conceited. One day, in a WeChat group, he questioned and discoursed concerning the "Wu-day not facing the True" and the "Quanzhen precepts," saying, "The 'Wu-day not facing the True' is nonsense; formerly, the Wu-day was an auspicious day." Moreover, he said, the Quanzhen precepts were borrowed from Buddhism, and so forth.

On the following day, at the fifth watch of the night, Wu had a dream. He floated to the summit of a mountain, and beheld mist and clouds, with pavilions rising high. Within the pavilions sat rows of novices clad in yellow robes. Suddenly, a red-robed Daoist appeared in mid-air, standing beside him were Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother. Instantly a thunderous roar resounded, and lightning cleft the long sky, shaking the mountains and rivers, clear to be heard! The red-robed Daoist said, "I am the Thunder God; thou shalt repent!" Having spoken, Wu awoke with a start. He then prayed and inquired before the Patriarch's altar, and received the Patriarch's guidance; it was because he had rashly spoken in the past two days about the "Wu-day not facing the True" and the "Quanzhen precepts," that the Thunder God gave warning.

The Iron-Crown Daoist said: "Among us now are some Daoist friends who have no lineage, or who do not follow the instructions of their masters. Having read a few books, they are self-conceited, and revile the scriptures and teachings. They criticize the Patriarchs' classics and pass judgment on their worthiness. This is great disrespect, and it breaks the faith of others, a grievous fault. The Patriarchs were all persons of great attainment; the Daoist Canon is the teaching of the Three Caverns; all that is admitted into the Daoist Canon has been approved by the worthy and great of successive generations. We need only believe, receive, and practise it, and must not entertain doubts. The Northern Dipper Scripture says: 'Those who are deluded and err, though they encounter the scriptures and secrets, harboring disbelief, such persons, after the body perishes, descend into the Three Paths, drifting among many states, and for ever lose the human form.' Not only the Northern Dipper Scripture, but also other scriptures must not be reviled."

"Now, within the Daoist Canon, there are sayings that the Wu-day may be used, and others that say it may not be used; this is because the transmission of the law is different, neither one being right or wrong. Each should adhere to his own lineage. The Heavenly Worthy, when speaking the scriptures, adapts his teachings to the place and occasion, using expedient means. For the sake of saving persons of diverse natures, there are different gates to the law. Though the methods are not the same, the ultimate purpose is one and the same. We must surely understand this point, and comprehend the Patriarchs' compassionate efforts to save men, and not utter words of reviling or entertain disbelief."

The Karma and Retribution Scripture says: "Those born as young swallows and mountain sparrows come forth from much talking and criticism of the scriptures and teachings." It further says: "To comment on scriptures and the law, and to forcibly assert right and wrong, breaking fasts and precepts, stealing and coveting wealth; all manner of disrespect and disbelief; such persons, when dead, enter the Nine Nether Hells, and undergo the eighteen torments."

Those who seek the Dao must not fail to know this. Otherwise the practice of the Dao cannot be accomplished, and boundless sins will be created. After the body perishes, one descends into the Three Paths. Alas! Alas! Take heed! Take heed!
