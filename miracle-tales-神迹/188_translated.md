# The Efficacious Deeds of Madam Tang Huiqin of Shanghai in Holding the Sacred Name of the Thunder Ancestor

Tang Huiqin, a native of Jiading in Shanghai, was engaged in the business of exporting furniture, and had accumulated a small fortune. In a certain year, she went to a monk's temple in Hunan to burn incense; upon her return, she found herself suffering bodily discomfort, sometimes pain, sometimes itching, at times in the shoulders and neck, at others in the lumbar vertebrae, or in the hands and feet, without a fixed place of affliction. She therefore sought out many skilled persons, lamas, Taoists, and monks. Some said it was due to ill feng shui; others said it was the work of evil spirits. Altogether she spent tens of thousands of taels, yet no very manifest effect was obtained.

Thereafter there came a Taoist from Wenzhou, one Master Zhao Fahhan, who came to Shanghai to practise divination. It happened that Tang Huiqin was also present, and she entreated Master Zhao to give her a method of solution. Master Zhao, recalling her misfortunes of having been deceived repeatedly, could not bear her to waste more money, and taught her to hold and recite the sacred name of "The Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Heavens Responding, the Thunder-Clap Universal Transformation." Tang Huiqin further asked, "Is there any swifter method?" Master Zhao said, "You may donate money to print some scriptures, and perform some meritorious deeds; the response will thereby be the quicker."

Tang Huiqin forthwith gave funds to print the scriptures. Returning home, she began to recite the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy, and gradually felt a warmth arise in her body. After persevering for several days, she dreamed that several golden-armoured generals descended from the northwest, and in her house searched out several clusters of blackish things, which they bound with iron chains and carried away. From that time the strange illness was healed.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: "The Jade Pivot Scripture declares: 'If men dwell in a place where birds and rats send forth evil spirits, snakes and insects bring forth calamities, bricks are thrown and tiles cast, hens and dogs are frightened, sacrifices are sought, and shadows and threats by dreams oppress the people, even to the presence of thieves; yet these spirits dare to occupy their abode and make it their nest, troubling the living. The courtyard is unclean; at night they howl on the beams; by day they watch over the chamber; oxen, horses, dogs, and swine suffer plague. Disaster reaches bones and flesh; affliction affects the offspring; impious shrines and demon societies abound; factions and treacherous spirits gather; mourners come frequently; funeral carriages go forth in multitudes. If one recites this scripture, the demons and spirits will be driven away, and men and things will be at peace.' The vow of the Heavenly Worthy may be called profound; the might and virtue of the Heavenly Worthy are truly great!"

In our time, those who pursue livelihood by feng shui and divination are mostly of the manner of the marketplace. Yet Master Zhao alone guides men to goodness, persuading them to turn to the Great Way — this is indeed rare! Those skilled in the arts of Lu Ban and feng shui are often solitary, poor, or bear the penalty of disability; but Master Zhao's family is harmonious and complete, his descendants are secure and happy — is this not the protection of the Ancestor's spirit in secret?
