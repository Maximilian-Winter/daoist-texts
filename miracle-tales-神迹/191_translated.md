# The Beggar Who Burned Incense and Repented of His Faults

In the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, in Jiangxi, there was a vagrant named Zhou Zhiren, who was past forty years of age, and lived each day by begging. In his youth he was indeed endowed with quick wit, and was sent by his parents to the best school in the county town. But, being too fond of play, he expended all his energies on trifling cunning, and in the end never attained even the degree of a licentiate. His father, who intended him for letters and an official career, seeing that this path was blocked, had no resource but to take him into business.

The Zhou family carried on a cloth shop, an occupation not of great extent, but sufficient to maintain the whole family. As the old father’s strength declined, Zhou Zhiren naturally took the charge of the shop; but, his idle habits unchanged, within two years the ancestral business was ruined by his hands, and his parents died of grief and sorrow. Looking upon his contemporaries, some officials, some wealthy, while he himself was now scantily clad and poorly fed, Zhou Zhiren lamented and sighed, repenting his past.

One day, as Zhou Zhiren was idling on the street, he suddenly saw a long line before the gate of the Wenchang Temple, much thronged. He drew near, and found that the local money-lender had just engaged the Taoist priests of the Wenchang Temple to perform a ritual for blessing, and was now distributing food to the people. For Zhou Zhiren, of course, this was an opportunity not to be missed, and he quietly took his place at the end of the queue.

While waiting in line, he heard those near him tell the story of this family.

It appeared that the money-lender had been a weakly child, visited by many physicians who declared his life could not be sustained; his family, in despair, brought him to worship at the Wenchang Temple, and lo! after returning home his health was miraculously restored. From that time forth the family had been devout to the Wenchang Emperor, contributing funds to repair the temple, and coming every month on the first and fifteenth days to pray and distribute food. This had continued for more than twenty years. Now they had a new chubby son, and today’s occasion was made all the more lively.

Hearing these words, Zhou Zhiren pondered within himself: Could the Wenchang Emperor really be so potent? He abandoned all thought of food, and went straight into the great hall, where with a thud he knelt before the Wenchang Emperor and began pouring out his bitter complaints, hoping the Emperor would have power to protect him, not seeking riches or honours, but only to be fed and clothed.

Having finished his prayer and about to rise, he suddenly heard a voice behind him, that of an old man calling out: ‘I cannot read; can you help me to see what is written on this wall?’ Though he had not studied well, Zhou Zhiren could read many characters. Approaching, he found the writing on the wall was the “Secret Instructions of the Wenchang Emperor,” and so he recited them at length for the old man.

When he read the admonitions of the Wenchang Emperor to the people:

“Those who desire to enlarge their fields of blessing must rely upon the heart and mind. In conduct, use timely expedients; perform various secret meritorious deeds. Benefit things and men; cultivate goodness and blessings. Uprightness acts for Heaven’s commission; kindness saves the people of the state...”

Zhou Zhiren was suddenly awakened. He himself sought blessings and prosperity, yet led a life of idleness and inactivity, and now came to ask the Wenchang Emperor as if expecting pies to fall from the sky. He felt shame for his former conduct.

From that time forth, Zhou Zhiren changed his former laziness; having no great talent, he first earned money by labour, going early each day to the market to do odd jobs. Whenever he had leisure, he would go to the Wenchang Temple to explain to others the “Secret Instructions of the Wenchang Emperor,” and relate the stories of efficacy he had heard. Gradually he became somewhat famous in the locality. The money-lender, having heard of his story, voluntarily contributed a sum to help him restore his ancestral business; thus his life finally took a right course. Five years later, Zhou Zhiren became a great rich man in the county town; and in the local Wenchang Temple the tale of his story was still widely told.
