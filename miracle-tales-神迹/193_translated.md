# The Tradition of the White Cloud Cave in the Rear Hills of Qingcheng

It is handed down that the White Cloud Cave in the rear hills of Qingcheng has been from ancient times the abode where the immortals cultivate themselves; the Patriarch White Cloud dwelt within this cave, which hence was called the White Cloud Cave. Within the cave there were also the Heavenly Book and the Precious Sword. It is said that whoever obtains that sword may summon the wind and call forth the rain; whoever obtains that Heavenly Book may turn stones into gold.

One day, there came a gentleman surnamed Zhou, styled Duan Gong, who had heard men say that within the cave were the Heavenly Book and the Precious Sword, and was exceedingly joyful. He thought to himself, "If I go and take them out, shall I not become an immortal?" So he bought a piece of buttered tallow weighing three and a half jin, and at early dawn on the morrow he climbed the precipitous cliffs and swung upon the hanging vines until he arrived at the mouth of the White Cloud Cave. On looking, he beheld a cavern vast indeed! By the mouth of the cave was carved a poem, and Zhou Duan Gong, recognizing some of the characters, began to hum it in affected manner:

Busy, busy, tidying the tattered robe,  
Arranging my travel gear as the day declines.  
My sleeves brush the white clouds as I leave the cave,  
My shoulders bear the bright moon as I cross the horizon.  
Piteous, the newly crying birds upon the branch,  
Reluctant, the old flowers beside the fence.  
I bid my dogs and cats follow me,  
No need for them to wander among the worldly folk.

When he had finished humming, Duan Gong thought: "The immortals at the mouth of this cave may well be gone." He hastened to light the buttered tallow, and boldly entered. Onward he went, and heard the murmuring of water within; approaching, behold! A small river barred his path. Luckily, there was a single-log bridge laid across it, but on lighting his tallow he saw the bridge was near decay. Gently he trod upon the single log, his heart trembling, cold sweat starting forth. Having passed the bridge, he went on and on, seeking the Heavenly Book and the Precious Sword.

As he walked, suddenly he saw ahead a light, and with joy hastened thither. But on drawing near, it was merely an exit from the cave. He thrust forth his head to peep out and cried, "My mother!"â€”so was his soul frightened away. Below was an abyss of ten thousand feet, with a great river roaring beneath the cliffs; across the river were likewise sheer precipices, and by the riverbank dwellings were visible, with the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs audible. Duan Gong thought, "Here there is no escape." He hastily turned and returned; looking at his buttered tallow, he saw more than half had burned away, and knew that his quest for the Heavenly Book and Precious Sword was in vain; so he resolved to return the way he came.

Going back he wandered on, and presently espied at the side a stone table; hastily lighting his tallow, he saw, "Lo! The Heavenly Book and Precious Sword lie upon this stone table." Zhou Duan Gong was overjoyed, and reached out his hand to seize them. Suddenly a voice cried aloud behind the table, "Hold! Behold the sword!" Startled, Duan Gong quickly withdrew his hand; looking, he saw that upon the rock wall was an image of the Patriarch White Cloud, who raised the sword on the table and struck at Duan Gong. Terrified, he cried aloud and fled helter-skelter; his tallow went out, and groping with his hands he at length climbed back to the side of the single-log bridge. In hurried fear he rekindled his tallow, crossed the bridge, and after further wandering emerged from the cave mouth. Looking back, he saw that the three and a half jin of buttered tallow had just been consumed. Looking at the sky, the sun was already about to set.

Zhou Duan Gong staggered out of the cave, and met some woodcutters; he related his experience within the cave to them, then, exhausted, vomited several mouthfuls of fresh blood and fell down dead. The mountain people buried him before the cave, and to this day the mound of his grave remains. And the Heavenly Book and Precious Sword? It is said that none dare to go and take them, and they still lie within the cave to this day.
