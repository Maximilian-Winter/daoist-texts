# The Story of Spirit Money at the Great Dragon Cave Taoist Temple in Zhaotong, Yunnan

When one speaks of spirit money, or dragon notes, many consider it merely a custom; yet from the standpoint of Taoism, there is profound mystery contained therein, touching upon the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Man. Below is related a story that occurred in the 1980s at the Great Dragon Cave Taoist Temple in Zhaotong, Yunnan, concerning spirit money.

In Zhaotong of Yunnan there stands the Great Dragon Cave Taoist Temple, and at that time its presiding master was Taoist Dai Mingchun. In the early years of the 1980s, when religious activities had just resumed, the temple sought to meet the demand for ritual services by procuring a mould for spirit money in the form of dragon notes. Using this mould, they printed a large quantity of spirit money and put it to use.

After some time, the temple became unclean, for strange occurrences happened frequently; and once, during a ritual, a small fire broke out. These unusual events attracted the attention of Master Dai Mingchun, who was a senior brother to Master Chen, and so he invited Chen to use the “Perfect Light” method to investigate the cause. The result was that in the temple’s storehouse there was found a heap of spirit money already consumed by fire—this was the state as presented in another dimension. These notes had been burnt in former rituals to offer to homeless spirits and the Earth God, but had all been rejected—being “counterfeit currency” unusable in the nether world! The spirits, feeling themselves deceived, disturbed the peace of the Great Dragon Cave Temple.

Thereupon, Master Chen burnt several notes of this version on the spot, and commanded five ghosts to take them to the Fengdu Money Office (bank) for verification. Before long, the five ghosts returned disconsolate, reporting that indeed the money was counterfeit, and that they had been rebuked by the Fengdu Money Office. Master Chen then opened a ritual altar and negotiated with the “manager” of the Fengdu Money Office, but the other party refused to give any reply.

Chen was compelled to invite the Ancestor Qiu to descend, but Qiu said he could not resolve the matter; then he invited Ancestor Lü, but again to no avail, for this issue of spirit money concerned the entire stability of the netherworld “society,” and was not a matter that any one deity could decide alone. Perceiving the gravity of the situation, Chen performed a ritual sending his primordial spirit to the Heavenly Court, where he reported at the Southern Heavenly Gate, and thence to the Tushita Palace to request the personal intervention of the Supreme Lord Laozi. After hearing the details, the Supreme Lord Laozi nodded and smiled, taking a vermilion brush to draw a cross upon the dragon note spirit money to signify approval. Chen then took the note to the Lingxiao Hall to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, who instructed that henceforth such dragon note spirit money must bear a seal on the reverse side, the seal bearing three hooks (symbolizing the Three Pure Ones) above, and beneath a character for gold; thus it might circulate and be used.

Upon his return, Chen immediately had the temple carve the seal, and after ritual consecration stamped ten dragon notes therewith. These were burnt and again entrusted to the five ghosts to carry to the Fengdu Money Office for verification. This time the five ghosts returned joyous, bearing bundles upon bundles of small denomination spirit money, having exchanged them for nine stamped dragon notes, while one note was retained on file at the Fengdu Money Office.

Thereafter the Great Dragon Cave Temple immediately burnt a great quantity of the dragon note spirit money bearing the Three Pure Ones’ gold seal, thus repaying the “old debts” of the past, and the spirits, having received the spirit money, no longer caused disturbance.

Since that time, this type of dragon note spirit money bearing the seal has been widely circulated in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other regions, and continues in use to this day...
