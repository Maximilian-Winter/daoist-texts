# The Strange Encounter of the Farmer's Innkeeper

Master Xu was a native of Xiushui in Jiangxi. Formerly he had served as a cook in distant parts, but afterwards he resolved to return home and open an inn. He looked at many places, and at last chose a two-storied house by the highway outside the county town, to establish a farmer’s inn. One reason was the great flow of people, and the nearness to the county town; another was the cheapness of the rent.

Not far beside the shop there stood a great camphor tree, which seemed to be some hundreds of years old. Beneath the tree was a small temple, bearing the inscription “Society of Great Peace.” Ancient records say that the tutelary spirits of such societies are often attached to trees. The temple beneath the tree had a quaint antiquity about it. Some had advised Master Xu that in former times this spot had been a place of execution, where many had died. The house had but short sunlight daily, and the air was heavy with Yin. “Better not be greedy for cheapness,” they said. But Master Xu replied, “What harm is it? Those that have spirit need not fear those that have none!”

He engaged a geomancer to select an auspicious day for the opening. As the courses were well managed, and the situation favourable, the business prospered. Yet the cook sometimes reported that, when a dish was prepared, it would inexplicably vanish, as if some one had come to steal a morsel. At night too, voices were sometimes heard in the hall; but on lighting the lamps, no one was to be seen. This was very strange.

One night after eight o’clock, a company of guests arrived, men and women, about ten in number. They ordered a large table of dishes. When the moon was high and the hour well advanced, after drinking and eating their fill, it was already past ten o’clock. The leader, a man of great belly, wearing dark glasses and with a bulging purse, came to settle the account. “How much?” he asked. The hostess reckoned up, “In all, thirteen hundred and fifty cash.” He bargained a little, then took out a bundle of paper money and gave it to the hostess. They talked and laughed, then vanished into the night.

The hostess was in good spirits, and reported to Master Xu. But the next morning, on opening the purse, they found that the thousand cash and odd had all turned to spirit money for burning. Then they understood that those who had supped with them on the night before were not living men of the world. Alarmed, they hastened to close the inn, and that house remains to this day deserted.

Iron-Crown Daoist said: “This story I heard from my master when I went to Xiushui. It seemed very strange. I had heard of ghosts taking taxis and paying with ghost money; and nowadays ghost money is much like the real, so it might be that the driver had not observed closely at night. But this inn, on the following day, had the money turned to spirit paper. If not a transformation of ghosts and spirits, it is hard to explain. The realm of ghosts and spirits is a dark mystery, not for us to pry into; we must not lose the heart of reverence.”
