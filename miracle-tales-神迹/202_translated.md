# The Story of Sun Daoyou of Guangdong Seeking the Way

Sun Daoyou was a native of Shenzhen. From childhood he delighted in watching the jiangshi films of Lin Zhengying, marvelling at the arts of the immortals, and dreamed that one day he might learn the Maoshan methods, to help the world drive away evils, cure diseases, catch ghosts, and seek wealth. At the bookstall he purchased a volume entitled The Daoist Spiritual Talismans, issued from the Hong Kong station, and accordingly drew talismans and recited incantations.

Afterwards, when he entered upon his employment, this Sun Daoyou also sought the Way far and wide. Hearing that somewhere there was a master who could perform the forbidden incantations, whereby the five ghosts might be made to carry wealth, he hastened to make contact and bought a ticket to study. Again, he heard that somewhere there was a Taoist priest, inheritor of the Fengdu art, possessing a complete set of talismans, and of surpassing skill in the methods. He spared no expense, travelling a thousand li to seek instruction. Thus it was for more than ten years; his heart could not be said to lack sincerity.

Whenever he met men, he boasted of his profound mastery of the Dao. And indeed, among the Taoist community about him, there was no one whose skill in the arts surpassed his.

Once, when he went to enjoy the scenery of Mount Hua, he encountered a wandering Taoist priest, of plain appearance, carrying a knapsack as he climbed the mountain. Since Sun Daoyou had already acquired the ability to see the world of spirits and ghosts, he perceived that this plain-looking priest was attended on by five Imperial Attendant Boys on either side, and guarded by six Heavenly Demon Kings. These were great spirits, not to be moved by ordinary petty arts. At that moment, suddenly there came a venomous snake, raising its head high, preparing to bite. The wandering Taoist priest, seeing this, scolded with a voice: “Evil obstructer, begone!” The venomous snake forthwith crouched down, dared not move, and slunk away into the grass in shame.

Sun Daoyou hurried forward and made a salutation, saying: “Sir, have mercy.” This greatly startled the wandering Taoist priest. “I am but clothed in rags,” he said, “one garment costing merely some tens of cash. This man is clad in a single Taoist robe worth over a thousand, yet he bows to me. Why?” The wandering Taoist hastened to return the salute, saying, “Your kindness, sir.”

Sun Daoyou said: “I see about you the officers of the Thunder Department, countless hosts of the Linting troops. I would fain know what cultivation and method you have, that you may govern and command so many ghosts and spirits. What method may be learnt whereby venomous snakes and fierce beasts bow their heads and obey? I entreat the venerable one, in compassion, to instruct me.”

The wandering Taoist was greatly puzzled, and said: “To speak truly, I know no arts. I am but a wandering pilgrim passing through here. Do not distress me. What you call these things, I understand nothing of. I merely persist daily in reciting a single scroll of the Beidou Scripture.”

The scriptures and treasured talismans are all proclaimed by the Heavenly Worthy’s golden mouth, precious to Heaven. Secreted in the treasure pavilions and jade terraces, guarded by immortal boys and jade maidens, sometimes inscribed in phoenix script and dragon characters, sometimes in cloud script and cinnabar writing. The Celestial Emperor’s subjects record and copy them. When the Great Way is to be traversed, these scriptures are transmitted to save men. The world knows not the preciousness of the sacred scriptures, but instead seeks petty methods and arts, and is self-satisfied. It is like one who has a precious treasure at home, but neither guards it well nor carefully, and yet goes abroad to beg. Is it not laughable?

The Ancestor said, “The scripture is the root of the method, and the method is the use of the scripture.” In the world there are many who cultivate the Way, but will not steadfastly and seriously recite the classics. Yet they hope to learn a method today, a spell tomorrow, to go and pray for deliverance and blessings for others. Do they not know that thus they move further and further from the Way? Where there is a great scripture, there is a great method. For example, where there is the Scripture of Deliverance, there are the methods of spiritual treasure to save men; where there is the Beidou Scripture, there are methods of dispelling calamities, reporting to the Dipper, and prolonging life; where there is the Yushu Scripture, there are methods to pray for sunshine or rain, and to drive away evils and forbid them. If the methods are not rooted in the scriptures, then they are no different from sorcery. If one knows how to perform methods but does not recite scriptures, then one is no better than a sorcerer. The scripture is for self-cultivation, the method for helping others.
