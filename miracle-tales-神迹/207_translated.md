# The Efficacy of Zhang Qingsheng of Jinhua in Offering the Scripture of the Northern Dipper

Zhang Qingsheng, a man of Dongyang in the city of Jinhua, once journeyed to Mount Chisong, where he obtained a copy of the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, the True Classic for Prolonging Life by the Original Destiny. At first, it was for the purpose of reciting the text, but fearing that his fasting was not strict, and being occupied with matters of business, he had no time to chant or uphold it. Therefore he wrapped it in red cloth and enshrined it upon the family altar at home.

About the year 2007, Zhang Qingsheng was afflicted with gout, and the pain was so great that tears flowed from his eyes. He sought treatment at the hospital, but the physicians declared that they could only alleviate the symptoms, not eradicate the disease. Zhang was in anguish and desired to die.

One night, he dreamt that ten immortals descended from heaven, puissant and comely men. They spoke to Zhang Qingsheng, saying: "We are the ten Immortal Officers of the Heavenly Master's discipleship. By command of the Heavenly Master, we guard and sustain the formulae of the Northern Dipper Scripture, in virtue of the merit you have earned in offering the True Classic for Prolonging Life by the Original Destiny of the Northern Dipper. The Heavenly Master sends us to save you. The pure water offered before the altar has received the true vital breath sent down by the Northern Dipper; you may drink it daily with great benefit. Do not use it any longer to water flowers." Having thus spoken, they vanished suddenly.

Awaking, Zhang Qingsheng remembered the vision clearly. Accordingly, he acted in accordance with the instructions, persevering in drinking the water; since then his gout has never recurred.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says: The Daoist Scriptures are three treasures. The treasure of Scriptures is the Phoenix seal and Dragon seal, the spiritual writings of the Nine Heavens, all guarded by divine beings. They are precious in the upper realms, and not lightly transmitted to the less worthy. If a man obtains them, he should regard it as a wonder beyond all imagining, and must reverence them with the utmost respect, to receive boundless blessings. The Scripture of Purity says: "He who has this scripture in his house shall receive the protection of ten good spirits of heaven about his person." The Jade Pivot Scripture says: "He who has this scripture in his house shall have auspicious smoke filling the courtyard, and clouds of felicity shading the hall." The Northern Dipper Scripture says: "He who has the Northern Dipper Scripture in his house will have the true spirit sent down from the Original Destiny." The Three Officials Scripture says: "He who has this scripture in his house shall have brightness in his dwelling." The Scripture for Delivering Men says: "Attending upon the scripture are the Five Emperors, the Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, twenty-four each, who marshal and guard the divine writings, protecting those who uphold the scripture." "By offering respectful worship, the household shall prosper; generation after generation it shall flourish; those who have affinity with goodness shall be unscathed by ten thousand calamities; the divine beings shall guard the doors."

If there be good and sincere persons who obtain these treasure scriptures, it is the supreme bridge to the Dharma. Though they be unable to uphold or read them, yet by offering respectful worship they shall likewise receive immeasurable merit and reward.
