# The Dream of the Infant Spirits Clinging to Master Su of Xuzhou

Master Su, a man of Xuzhou in the province of Jiangsu, belonged to a wealthy family, and was comely in appearance, the good child in the eyes of his parents. While studying at the university in Nanjing, he had several girlfriends, and for a time maintained relations with several maidens concurrently. Moreover, there were several female students who, at his bidding, submitted to abortion. Master Su took this as a matter of course, sometimes even boasting of it to his friends. A certain roommate, who reverently observed the Three Treasures, earnestly admonished Master Su, saying, ‘Do not thus act; the Way of Heaven is burdened with responsibility; cause and effect cannot be escaped.’ But Master Su, addicted to the pleasures of the senses, paid no heed.

After graduation, the enterprise of Master Su’s family fell into mismanagement and ruin. Master Su dwelt in the family home, unwilling to take employment, his spirit languishing and depressed. At times he dreamed that there were two or three infants, clad in crimson petticoats, playing about him, then suddenly crying aloud without ceasing, crying out, ‘Father, why do you treat us thus?’

One year at the Spring Festival, his family urged Master Su to seek a marriage match, sending his portrait to the lady. The lady said, ‘The look in this man’s eyes is wanton,’ and refused further acquaintance.

Master Su was greatly distressed, and so sought out his former roommate to inquire about this matter. The roommate said, ‘When you were a student, you indulged in the pleasures of the flesh and thereby committed the sin of debauchery; the Three Officials have long recorded this. You also caused abortions at will, harming life and taking life. The resentful bonds thus formed cause the spirits of the infants to be unwilling to depart, and so evil retribution and suffering have befallen you. You urgently need to repent and to perform rites to liberate the infant spirits, that you may obtain release.’

Accordingly, Master Su was instructed to copy out the “Wondrous Scripture for Resolving Grievances of Three Lives”, the “True Scripture for Deliverance from the Blood Lake”, and several scrolls of the “Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity”. A venerable Dharma master was invited to perform morning and evening reverences to the Three Primes, to resolve grievances and untie knots, and to conduct the Lingbao sacrificial rites and alchemy. Later, on the day of the Zhongyuan festival, Master Su dreamed that the infants bore round halos upon their backs, saying, ‘Father, thank you for inviting the immortals to receive us; farewell.’ From that time forth, he no longer dreamed of infants.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: ‘The people of today, addicted to the pleasures of the flesh, seek only momentary joy, not knowing that this is a sea of suffering without end. Some do not believe in cause and effect, nor revere ghosts and spirits; yet the Way of Heaven is fair and just, rewarding good and punishing evil, manifest and without deceit.

The spirits of the infants originally desire life; with great difficulty they enter the womb, but die therein, suffering the torments of cutting and poison. How deep is their poison and resentment! Can it be lightly disregarded? They thus linger and refuse to depart, and the parents who committed the sin bring upon themselves misfortune; how can their fortune be good? Were it not for the supreme compassion of the Most High, who has set up this boat of the Law, the resentful would repay each other without end. Alas! Rather than be lost in the pleasures of the flesh and the boundless sea of suffering, better to turn back, to bow before the Mysterious Sovereign, and to take refuge in the Three Treasures.

As it is said:

Some are enamoured of the pleasures of the senses, all living beings,  
Sunken deep in the sea of suffering, infinite and measureless.  
Bow before the Blossom Grove and worship the East,  
Raise the hands in homage to the Mysterious Grace, dispelling calamity and hindrance.’
