# The Efficacy of the General’s Talisman of Liu Tupei

Liu Tu, styled Wengang, at the age of fifteen wore the talisman of the seventy-five generals. In his youth he was intelligent and skilled in arithmetic. Afterwards he became a county official of Jiangxia, where he was upright and cautious in the discharge of his duties.

In the third year of the Yongchu era of the Later Han under Emperor An, on the night of the tenth day of the second month, at the midnight hour, the Lord of Mount Tai sent his messenger, Ya-yu, to invite Liu Tu to go and revise the registers of the world. Ya-yu told his family not to weep, for Liu Tu was not to die.

Liu Tu followed Ya-yu to Heaven, and there he beheld the Five Supreme Immortals—the Grand Supreme Lord, the Lord of Mount Tai, the Lord of Hidden Immortals, the Heavenly Master, and the Lord of Morality and Virtue. Liu Tu made reverent obeisance to them. The Grand Supreme Lord said to him, ‘I know that you have died because you upheld the Way, believed in the truth, and held fast to goodness; I also know that you are intelligent and skilled in arithmetic, therefore I have summoned you to revise the registers of the lives and deaths of all men under Heaven.’

Liu Tu was led to meet the Left and Right Chancellors under the Lord of Mount Tai, and together they took part in the revision work. At midnight on the second day, Liu Tu completed the task and took leave of the Grand Supreme Lord. The Lord said, ‘I will now take you to view the place where Heaven’s Way is manifested and upheld, where the guilt and merit of men are determined.’

The messenger Ya-yu took Liu Tu to a place called Mi-li. At the first level, he saw more than three thousand women, their heads suspended on great trees, their feet fettered with iron shackles weighing a hundred and ten catties, suffering punishment. At the next level, he saw over three thousand men, their heads likewise suspended on trees, similarly fettered with heavy iron shackles and tortured. He proceeded to the third, fourth, and even the tenth level, and everywhere he saw people undergoing punishment and suffering. Some wore iron shackles; some had their heads hung on trees; some had their hands bound; some were cast into boiling iron pots; some had great stones pressing upon their heads; some were pierced through with forks; some were so scourged that their bodies were rotten and their pain unspeakable. Ya-yu said, ‘All those you have just seen are punished because in their lives they slandered the Three Treasures of the Way, oppressed the common people, and thereby incurred guilt.’

Liu Tu next went to the eleventh level, and there he saw his deceased father being scourged together with three hundred others. Liu Tu bowed his head to Heaven and loudly inquired, ‘What crime has my father committed to deserve such punishment?’ Ya-yu replied, ‘Your father, when alive, was a prison officer. He killed men without inquiry, wrongfully harming many good people; therefore, after death, he must undergo such punishment. He must endure seven more years of such penalty to repay his sins. I will report this to the Heavenly Official on your behalf, and ask for your father’s pardon.’

Liu Tu returned to the presence of the Grand Supreme Lord, and prostrated himself earnestly. The Lord said, ‘You need not be anxious; I will pardon your father.’ The Lord then bade Ya-yu take Liu Tu to the Taiqing Palace. There he saw thirty-six thousand persons dressed in blue robes, holding golden tablets, chanting the scriptures; their food and drink were ample, and the music resounded through Heaven. Ya-yu said, ‘These people, in life, wore the talisman of the Heavenly Official, cultivated the Way diligently and without falling back, and were most devout; therefore, after death, they enter the realm of Taiqing and enjoy the bliss of Heaven.’

Having viewed these scenes, Liu Tu requested to return to the world of men. The Grand Supreme Lord said to him, ‘Return and relate to the common people and Daoists what I have told you. Let them know the fruits of good and evil, the retribution of guilt and merit; and let them not lightly do anything that harms Heaven and outrages reason. Your time to return is brief, so I can only show you these scenes in outline. You men and Daoists must avoid all evil and practise all good, and monthly remove the guilt from your bodies. I look forward to meeting you again at the time of the Rat and Ox in the White Beast.‘ Liu Tu reverently thanked the Grand Supreme Lord and then returned to the human world.

The life and death of men are recorded respectively by the heavenly and earthly officials, who note their guilt and merit. Whatever a man has done, not one is omitted. Hence the scripture says, ‘The net of Heaven is wide, and though loose, it lets nothing escape.’ Mount Luofeng lies to the north in the land of Gui, standing two thousand six hundred li high, and encircled by twenty thousand li. The Grotto Heaven around it extends ten thousand li; in the centre are six palaces, which are the abodes of the six heavenly ghosts and spirits. Each palace has a circumference of one thousand li. After death, men must pass through these palaces, and according to their good or evil deeds in life, undergo due punishment.

Mount Luofeng has eight hells above, eight below, and eight in the middle, making twenty-four hells in all. Beneath Mount Tai are the Five Government Hells. Hell is also found amid the mountains, rivers, and seas throughout the world. Each hell has its officers, who, after inflicting the three tortures and five pains on those due punishment, send them to Mount Tai, or to the Eastern Sea, or to the Three Evil Paths, or to be born in lands beyond China among the four barbarian tribes, or to be born ignobly, or to be born with disease—all these are repayment of the debts of sin from their former lives.

The Lord said, ‘The good ascend to Heaven, the wicked descend to Hell. Those sinners, after enduring divers pains in Hell, are reborn as beasts or ignoble persons, incarnated in backward lands without civilization. The sages have compassion on them and expound to them the doctrine that Heaven’s Way records and bears witness to good and evil, reward and punishment; this is clearly stated in the Inner Transmission of Master Wenshi. The ignorant say that the Way only teaches stillness and emptiness, and deny retribution; they harbour disdain and profanation in their hearts—how can this fail to move men to lament? The Grand Supreme Lord, moved with pity for the world, caused men of virtue like Liu Tu to reveal to all the pains of Hell and the joys of Heaven, hoping that men may reform their evil ways, cultivate goodness, and become good men.’
