# The Tale of Liu Guolong of Wenzhou: His Offering to the Temple and Its Verification

Liu Guolong, a native of Yueqing in Wenzhou, in the nineties began to establish a hardware factory at home, and his life gradually grew prosperous; he came to possess both carriage and dwelling. One year, Liu Guolong went to the Xuandu Temple to burn incense; at that time the temple was undergoing repair. A good thought arose in his heart, and he bestowed upon the temple a donation of thirty thousand taels of silver.

In the year of Wuzi, when the financial crisis swept over the world, many small factories in Wenzhou were closed down; the factory of Liu Guolong also fell into adversity. Therefore he sought out a famous diviner of Wenzhou to cast his fate by the hexagrams. The diviner examined his destiny and said: In the year Yiyou he passed into the great cycle of Renwu; in the year Wuzi he would offend Heavenâ€™s clash with Earth, indicating that his career would be unsuccessful, accompanied also by injury and punishment. The diviner admonished Liu to be careful and drive with caution.

One autumn evening, Liu Guolong was dining and drinking with some friends of business. After wine, he drove home. When he arrived at the carriage station, suddenly a freight cart dashed out from the opposite side. Alarmed, Liu hastily turned the steering wheel; but the speed of the carriage was too great, and for a moment he could not stop the vehicle; it seemed about to plunge into the river. At that instant, it was as if a strong man appeared, his hair bound, black beard, naked to the waist and barefoot, wearing a short brown garment slantwise over his shoulder; he upheld the carriage. When the carriage came to a halt, the strong man vanished. On getting down, Liu saw that the front wheel had already fallen into the river. Liu was greatly astonished, and regarding the immortal he had just seen, he wondered: What spirit was it who saved me?

It is said that shortly after the accident, Liu rested at home for several days, then said to his wife that he would go to Xuandu Temple to burn incense and give thanks. As soon as he entered the mountain gate, he saw two strong men at the gate; one of them was exactly the strong man who had saved him on that night. He then knew that it was because he had formerly donated to the repairing of the temple that the gods, mindful of his merit, had secretly protected him. So he quickly prostrated himself and gave thanks.
