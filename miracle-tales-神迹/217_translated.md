# Seizing Life to Replace Death, Bewilderment by Spirits and Confusion of the Mind

In recent days at Nanchang Dream Times Square, there have been successive cases of people leaping from heights. Some say it is a matter of geomancy; others say that the dead seize and replace the living spirits. This reminds me of an event I personally experienced several years ago in Fujian.

It was once when I went to visit a hydroelectric station; the dam was as high as five storeys, so one can imagine how deep the reservoir was. At that time, I was inexplicably inclined to go down and swim. I had even taken off my shoes; since a fellow Daoist companion was with me, I did not remove my clothes, intending to swim in them. Then I was sharply rebuked by my teacher’s uncle, who asked me what I meant to do. I said I wished to bathe in the water. The uncle said: ‘Do you no longer wish to live? To bathe in water so deep!’ Afterwards, when I returned to the temple, I still felt a chill run down my spine. In truth, the weather was not very hot, it was around the fifth or sixth month of the solar calendar. It was truly a bewilderment of the mind by spirits; a voice kept urging me: ‘Go down and swim, it is cool and pleasant.’ The water was so deep, and I was at the deepest part; should any accident occur, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, I think the phrase ‘bewilderment of the mind by spirits’ is not coined without reason. When entering the mountains, it is good to wear the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The Jade Pivot Classic states: ‘Seizing life to replace death.’ Its meaning is that in certain places there are souls who died violent deaths, whose spirits are detained there, unable to be born anew, requiring someone to fill their place, so that the previously violently dead may then be reborn. The ghosts here often bewilder the living, causing them to be reversed and to die untimely deaths. Therefore, when a place has souls who died violent deaths, similar events are apt to occur one after another. If a person’s yang energy is weak, they are easily bewildered by ghosts. It is advised to carry on one’s person the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains. If in the mountains, when encountering the ‘ghost walls’ (迷墙), according to what is recorded in the Treatise on Embracing Simplicity, one should recite the nine-character true spell, namely, ‘The soldiers arrayed in battle all advance in order.’
