# The Story of the Daoist Practitioner of the Ritual Art and the Mountain Demons and Wood Spirits

Zou Daozhang was a man of Nanyang in Henan. A Daoist of the Taiqing Palace in Nanyang, he inherited the rites of Fengdu, officiating in summoning and examining in the netherworld, often with miraculous efficacy, and his fame spread throughout his native village. In his later years he was especially able to ascend the altar and perform the ritual art; the local people regarded him as a transcendent immortal. Zou Daozhang also counted himself among the immortals.

One night, Zou Daozhang dreamed that a celestial envoy clad in vermilion robes descended from heaven, and said unto him: "Master Zou, in your lifetime you have subdued demons and exorcised evil spirits; your merit is profound. The Jade Emperor issues an imperial decree, appointing you an Immortal Officer. On the fifteenth day of the coming month, at the hour of the Tiger, the Immortal Carriage will come to receive you. Pray, prepare yourself beforehand, Immortal Elder." Zou Daozhang received the decree and expressed his gratitude with deep emotion.

When the day arrived, he took leave in advance of his fellow Daoists and disciples, bathed and changed his garments, and awaited the celestial carriage to come and fetch him. Sure enough, the music of sheng and xiao, drums and flutes, came floating on the air; a sedan-chair appeared, and it halted at the gate of Taiqing Palace. Zou Daozhang saluted the assembled immortals, mounted the chair, and departed, secretly rejoicing in his heart.

The chair travelled about half an hour; the music ceased, but outside the chair the chilling wind whistled. Presently, the chair alighted. Voices were heard calling, "Descend!" Zou Daozhang was perplexed. Just now they had respectfully called me Immortal Elder; how was it now that they were so rude? He alighted and beheld that the chair stood at the edge of a precipice. Beyond was a giddy abyss many fathoms deep; on the opposite cliff, a row of spirits and demons hovered in midair, with blue faces, tusks, and strange and frightful forms. These spirits said: "Throughout your life in the practice of the ritual art, how many of our kin have you slain! Now it is for you to choose whether to leap down yourself, or whether we shall escort you on the way." Zou Daozhang perceived that death was certain today. He spoke to these spirits: "I know my sins are grievous, and that I ought to die in expiation. But having set out early today, and not yet having drunk water, may I drink a mouthful before I die?" The spirits found this request reasonable, and so brought him a bowl of water. Zou Daozhang held the water in his left hand with the Three Mountains Gesture, drew the sword talisman with his right hand, and, having taken a mouthful of water, blew it towards the spirits. Instantly the black clouds dispersed, and the spirits fled in disarray. Zou Daozhang hastened back to Taiqing Palace.

His fellow Daoists were astonished, saying, "Had you not ascended to immortality? How come you have returned?" Zou Daozhang related the whole affair to them, and they were all deeply moved. Shortly after his return, Zou Daozhang fell grievously ill, and after a few days he passed away and was transformed.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The incantation says "Slay ten thousand ghosts." Our Patriarch considered that those who cultivate the Dao should not harbour too great a spirit of killing; and therefore changed "slay ten thousand ghosts" into "deliver ten thousand people." When encountering evil spirits and demons causing mischief, there are often antecedent causes. The ritual practitioner should first seek to reconcile and explain grievances, and to dissuade hostilities. If persuasion is impossible, the situation must be understood; if indeed there be enmity, one must not protect one's own side excessively. If, however, the demon is a noxious fiend stirring up trouble without cause, then one may invoke thunder and lightning to punish it. The rites of Fengdu are renowned for their harshness; though efficacious, the anger of ghosts and spirits is very terrible. The story of Zou Daozhang may serve as a warning to those who perform the ritual art.
