# The Story of the Taoist Liu Chengde of Taizhou Reciting Scriptures with a Mundane Mouth

Liu Chengde was a Taoist of Jiaojiang in Taizhou. Among the people of the regions of Taizhou and Wenzhou, there was a fondness for holding Taoist rituals. In Taizhou there were over two thousand Taoist temples, and generally each temple had but one or two Taoists, who chiefly made their living by the recitation of scriptures. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Taoists received about two hundred (cash) per day for reciting scriptures, together with a packet of tobacco. It is said that now this has risen to three hundred.

The Taoist priest Liu Chengde was a high-ranking adept, and so he traveled about Taizhou conducting Taoist rituals. His voice was excellent, and all were glad when he took charge of the scriptures. Today he might be in Wenling, tomorrow in Jiaojiang, and the day after in Huangyan. The journeys were wearisome, so he could not attend to many things carefully. It was unavoidable that he would sometimes recite scriptures with a mundane mouth, or that his unclean hands would touch what was impure. At times, when busy, he would skip parts of the scriptures, reciting one passage and omitting another, then jumping to a different section.

Sometimes the elder practitioners would admonish him, saying, ‘Comrade Taoist Liu, you must not do so when reciting scriptures. Unclean hands touching impurities, and reciting with a mundane mouth, are both offences. If the scriptures are not recited in full, after death you must go to the Eastern Peak to make supplementations.’ Taoist Liu paid little heed and said, ‘The Eastern Peak — where is there such a place? Who has seen it? Besides, we every day worship the Jade Emperor and repent at the repentance ceremony; does not that ceremony say, “May the offences of unclean hands touching impurities and reciting with a mundane mouth be extinguished”? We repent daily. Moreover, we have not eaten flesh; what we eat is seafood, and seafood is not flesh. There is no harm. The Patriarch, great in compassion and mercy, will not hold it against us.’

One year, Liu Chengde went to Taizhou Palace of Great Clarity in Huzhou to perform deliverance rites. When ascending the altar, his cap fell off. The fellow Taoists took this as an ill omen and urged the Taoist Liu not to mount the altar. He replied, ‘It is nothing; I will fix it again.’ But just as he was invoking the spirits of the departed, a gust of chilling wind suddenly came upon him, and Taoist Liu was so frightened that he fell from the platform of the Dharma King, his countenance turned ashen, and he kept uttering, ‘I have offences, I have offences.’ Thereafter he was ill for many months, and never again dared to conduct Taoist rituals.

When asked what he had seen, Taoist Liu would not speak. After many months he confided to his fellow Taoists, saying, ‘When I invoked the spirits of the departed, I saw countless lonely souls and evil ghosts coming forward. But because my fast was not strict, I could not transform my food nor deliver them. So they all pursued me to beat me. The City God was there also, but because the impurity upon me was too heavy, the spirits would not draw near. In the future, when you recite scriptures, be sure to follow the rules of the Patriarch.’
