# The Earth Deity Manifests to Respond, Protecting the Good and Preserving Peace and Health

In the year 00, Master Zhang was engaged in the transportation of vehicles over long distances. Once, passing by a country road, he alighted from his carriage on account of a pressing necessity. While relieving himself, he espied a wild pheasant. At that time, the protection of wild animals had not yet been well established or regulated; therefore, Master Zhang was startled by the mountain fowl. He observed that this bird seemed unable to fly, and resolved to seize it, to offer it in sacrifice to the temple of the five viscera.

He began to pursue it amidst the mountain forest. Indeed, the pheasant could not fly, yet it kept a certain distance from him, so that whenever he was about to give up, he yet managed to overtake it; but when he was about to grasp it, the pheasant would cleverly elude his hand. When Master Zhang had gone round a very large tree, the pheasant suddenly vanished. He searched all around but found it not, and so gave up the pursuit. Then he prepared to leave the forest and resume his journey. But at that moment he found himself unable, by any means, to get out of the woods. Afraid, he began to run and seek repeatedly, yet he could not find the way out. He remembered that it was said that at such a time, if one were to light a cigarette, the flame would dispel the "devil’s enclosure." He struck fire and lit the cigarette, but all was of no avail.

At length he was wearied, and laid himself down beneath a tree and entered into a dream. Therein he saw an old man, who said unto him: "Thou hast ever offered me sacrifice; I must help thee. I have opened the mountain path for thee; hasten back to thy carriage, but wait until dawn to drive on." Having thus spoken, he awoke. The old man’s visage he remembered as that of the Earth Deity of his village. Since he drove his carriage to secure peace, he was wont to burn incense and offer worship to the Earth Deity, with the burning of paper and money. At length he found the way out, returned to his carriage, and waited until dawn before setting forth again.
