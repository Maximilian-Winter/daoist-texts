# The Household's Resentful Qi Nourishes Spirits and Demons, Bewitching the People

The Record of Master Longqing's Subjugation of Demons: If you do not believe it, take it merely as a tale to be read; but if you do believe, then you may find peace of mind, and become a faithful believer.

The story occurred in the year 2021 within the home of a devout believer in Suzhou, where one also witnessed with his own eyes this supernatural event. It was thus: the family bore the surname Sun, and had dwelt there for many years. All was well at first; but suddenly one day the father of Mr. Sun (hereafter called Sun Senior) struck the wife of Mr. Sun. Although she was a woman of Wu and Yue, speaking softly in the tongue of Wu, and of gentle disposition, yet faced with such a matter, who would fear whom? Thus a mutual scuffle began.

After the battle, the wife of Mr. Sun packed her belongings and returned to her maternal home. Shortly thereafter, a call came from the child, who also wished to return home. Upon the child's return, Sun Senior was greatly angered and asked, “Where have you been again?” The child replied, “Just off from work.” Sun Senior scolded, “So young and already telling lies! Clearly you skipped work to play games at home; now you pretend to have just come back from outside.” Unable to endure this, the child requested to reside with the mother at the grandmother’s house. Mr. Sun felt something was amiss, and verified with the child’s place of work, learning that the child had indeed not shirked duty.

Mr. Sun then began to watch closely, and what followed was yet more terrible, leaving him aghast and filled with terror.

One day, Mr. Sun was at home, using WeChat to entreat his wife’s forgiveness, promising to properly handle the matter. At that moment, a human shadow suddenly passed before the door; what was fearful was that this figure was none other than Mr. Sun himself, lying on his bed. Instantly, Sun Senior began to curse again, and rushed into Mr. Sun’s room, demanding why water had been poured upon him. In that moment, Mr. Sun understood.

There was a thing, taking the form of a member of his household, provoking the ill-tempered Sun Senior and causing domestic discord. Strange as it may seem, what was seen was true. Later, one day, Sun Senior went out to buy vegetables. Upon returning, he heard Mr. Sun at the doorway reproving him for not watching the cooking pot. Puzzled, Sun Senior opened the door, and saw in the kitchen a figure like himself, while Mr. Sun was washing the cooking utensils. Seeing this scene, both Sun Senior and Mr. Sun were greatly terrified. But the Sun Senior within the kitchen only smiled. Sun Senior and Mr. Sun fled in fright.

Now Sun Senior understood. Because of this affair, the elderly Sun Senior even spent several days in hospital. There was no choice; the young could not endure such a sight, much less an irritable old man.

Sun Senior and Mr. Sun went to apologize at Mr. Sun’s wife’s home, but she could not accept such an incredible explanation. Yet the elders had taken a position; but Sun Senior and Mr. Sun declared they would by no means return home. Thus, the family rented another house elsewhere, yet they still could not escape the entanglement of this thing. Members of the household successively saw their own doubles, and even the doubles took the forms of members of the family; seeing no way to escape, they sought a resolution.

The family set about, engaging many persons, even inviting those from Southeast Asia, and lamas from Tibet; still there was no solution, though some mitigation was obtained, but only partial and not complete. All available means were nearly exhausted. The family had converted to various religions: Buddhism failing, they embraced Daoism; Daoism failing, they underwent baptism; baptism failing, they sought empowerment rites.

During our casual talk, Mr. Sun’s wife asked him, “May the Daoist Masters have tea?”

Master Longqing and Master Longyue exchanged looks; Master Longyue said, “You would do well to keep quiet, that is better than anything.”

Hearing this, Mr. Sun’s “wife” bowed her head and withdrew. Mr. Sun understood at once, calling out his wife’s name; at that moment, the true wife came out from the bedroom with tea bags, while the “wife” entered the kitchen.

In truth, such transformations are easy to discern. To our eyes, the apparitions bear “blurred edges,” much like using Photoshop to place an image on a background with excessively feathered borders. Between the true and the false persons, the difference is vast and manifest at a glance.

Thus, first a net of Heaven and Earth was cast over the house; finally, a dialogue was held with this thing.

It was found that this thing was a mountain spirit recently awakened, belonging to the category of animals wrongfully slain near a tree, whose essence and blood the tree absorbed, thus acquiring some spiritual aura. The dead animal had itself been somewhat cultivated, but fate decreed it to perish unjustly in the wilds, its blood soaking the grass and trees. The essence of the grass and trees had been unearthed by Sun Senior. Then it began to disturb the household. Because Sun Senior had always tyrannized at home, family members bore resentful qi, and this qi served as food for such things. Yet when such resentful qi is overconsumed, whether by demon, ghost, spirit, or sprite, it turns to darkness.

In such a state, the Daoist has the authority to imprison or slay directly, but the laws concerning ghosts require that, unless there is great transgression, leniency should be shown. The outcome for this thing was to be bound and sent to the Eastern Peak for judgment. It had disturbed the people, but fortunately caused no death. It was likely to be punished with decades or even a hundred years of confinement, or to be ordered to guard some place and not allowed to come forth.

In our lives, only we ourselves can hold our tongues, refraining from uttering the most hurtful words to those who care for us most—our loved ones and kin. We must guard our hearts, avoid anger that injures the liver, avoid sowing discord and breaking harmony, avoid breeding excessive resentful qi. Therefore, we must heed that where the family is harmonious, all things prosper. Only when the household is at peace can evil be transformed to good, and more blessings be drawn near. Else, one misfortune will follow another in ceaseless succession.
