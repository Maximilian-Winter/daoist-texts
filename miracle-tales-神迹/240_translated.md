# The Mirror of Hell Revealing the Good and Evil of Past Deeds

In the "Supreme Compassionate Daoist Altar for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Hells," there is a detailed enumeration of the thirty-seven names of hells. Besides the thirty-six hells distributed to the east, west, south, and north, there is another hell at the centre. Within this hell is suspended a mirror, which is cast upon the transgressor's person, "disclosing distinctions that were otherwise concealed, appearing within the mirror itself." This mirror here mentioned is the "Karma Mirror."

The Karma Mirror, later among the people further transformed into the "Mirror of Iniquity," is a mirror that exists within the realm of the netherworld. The "Ten Kings of the Underworld's Rite of Liberation" clearly states that, among the ten courts of the netherworld, the fifth court is presided over by the Most Holy Brilliant Spirit True Lord (that is, King Yama). This court is provided with the "Karma Mirror," whereby the deceased, awaiting the "fifth and seventh" days in their cycle of transmigration, endure suffering. In the "Karma Mirror" there is revealed the goodness and evil of their past deeds, and according to this they receive their recompense.

According to the records in the Qing dynasty by Qian Yong in "Luyuan Conghua": On the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the thirteenth year of the Yongzheng reign, a scholar surnamed Chen from Loumen was seized and interrogated by the netherworld’s officials due to the crimes of his past three lifetimes. In the underworld, he was confronted privately with his paramour; one said the woman had acted of her own accord, the other claimed the matter to be one of entrapment and seduction. Each side held to its word, and the dispute was at a standstill. At last, without recourse, a ghostly attendant was commanded to employ the "Mirror of Iniquity" to reveal the truth. It was discovered indeed that the woman had voluntarily cast herself into his arms, and judgment was passed accordingly.

When the departed arrive at the netherworld to undergo judgment, it is indeed as if the person who has done evil has entered the police station. For fear of cruel punishment, they will often play tricks or tell falsehoods, hoping to lessen their guilt or even to clear themselves of blame. At this time, just by a glance before the Karma Mirror, all the sins of one’s life stand fully reflected. The self-committed crimes of killing, stealing, licentiousness, and falsehood are all faithfully displayed, without any concealment. It is as the saying goes, "The heart knows, the belly understands; shame is overwhelming, and there is no word to defend." Thus, no matter how one wishes to flee, escape is impossible.

Yet the Karma Mirror can only reveal the surface of events; it cannot penetrate into the depths of the mind. In Ji Xiaolan’s "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations" it is recorded: "What the Karma Mirror reflects is the goodness or evil of actions alone. As to the subtle feelings of the heart, the manifold falsities of the emotions, their arising and ceasing without constancy, their concealment and uncertainty, their deep and profound intricacies without trace accessible to view — often the outward appearance is splendid as the mythical qilin or phoenix, but within they tread the ghostly realm, hidden and unformed; the Karma Mirror cannot reflect these."

This means that what the Karma Mirror reveals is only the goodness or evil of affairs; but the myriad feelings in the heart at the time, and the truth or falsehood of the emotions, the mirror cannot show. Therefore, besides the Karma Mirror, there is mention of the concept of the "Mirror of the Heart." A distinction is drawn between the two mirrors’ functions: the "Karma Mirror" is used to discern the "true villain," while the "Mirror of the Heart" distinguishes the "false gentleman."

Though no prior writings have this statement, in essence the term "Mirror of the Heart" is an extension of the concept of the "Karma Mirror." The "Mirror of the Heart," though specially employed to inspect the heart of man, still belongs within the category of the "Karma Mirror."

Moreover, "Guwang Tingzhi" further explains the principle by which the "Karma Mirror" projects the truth: When a man does a certain deed, a memory impression concerning this deed is left within his heart. The "Karma Mirror" thereby projects this image; but if a man does something without intention, not aware himself, with no such imprint in his heart, then even when the "Karma Mirror" is employed, nothing can be seen. Hence the judgment of the netherworld officials is based upon the presence or absence of intention in distinguishing good and evil. Though this is the author’s own understanding of the projection principle of the "Karma Mirror," it also represents the contemporary comprehension of the "Karma Mirror."

As the common saying is, "Three feet above the head there are gods." In the dark beyond, there is indeed the Karma Mirror; whether good or evil is done, it cannot endure the mirror’s gaze. One must take no thought of expediency. Men may be deceived, but Heaven cannot be deceived.
