# Reckless Words Bring Retribution (A Single Word Seals Fate) Series

Formerly, in China, at a marriage one was wont to pay homage to Heaven and Earth, to one's parents, and the spouses to one another. The purpose of worshipping Heaven and Earth was to take the heavens and the earth as the witnesses to the marriage, to vow lifelong responsibility to each other, and to call upon the spirits of Heaven and Earth to bear witness and supervise one's conduct; should there be any violation, punishment from the spirits would befall. 

If one observe attentively, perchance one may find that the oaths uttered by men during their lives will be fulfilled at appointed times and in appointed places. Many facts testify to the truth that oaths are at last accomplished.

Therefore the elders in the villages generally pay regard to taboo in speech; words not to be spoken are left unsaid, perhaps for fear that careless utterance might bring retribution. Whether the vow be sincerely made or spoken lightly and perfunctorily, the dharma realm regards only the act of vowing; so long as the oath is sworn, it is as if a contract is signed, and the contract must be fulfilled.

The ancients attached special importance to the power of writing and speech, holding deep reverence and caution towards them; they believed writing to be created by the divine, and regarded speech as a mysterious force that governs human life.

Why do “prophetic words” come true? This too may be explained by the principles of the Book of Changes. When a man speaks recklessly, these ill words and the disasters they foretell belong to a certain negative energy field; when we utter such words, by the principle of the Changes, “those of like qi seek each other, those of like sound respond to each other,” our destiny is thereby induced to approach these negative outcomes. In other words, we actively attune the frequency of our life's fate to that of the disaster. It may be said that calamity is also self-summoned.

For example: some boast that they have not caught a cold for a long while, and soon after, they catch a cold; others say their driving skill is excellent, having never had a scratch or bump, and soon after suffer a traffic accident; some say they rarely lose things, then shortly afterwards mislay their phone... These scenes, doubtless, each of us or our friends have experienced.

When we say “I never…” or “It has been long since I last…,” in truth we have placed ourselves in a dangerous state. The Confucian classic Shangshu says: “Pride invites loss, humility receives benefit.”

## Reckless Speech: Disrespecting Spirits Brings the Ghostly Wall

Several years past, a client of mine told me of his own experience: their company held its annual meeting at a resort near the Thirteen Tombs in Beijing for three days. On the afternoon of the second day, he and two friends suddenly returned to the city to attend to some matters. When they had finished and were returning, it was near dusk as they neared the resort.

The three chatted idly in the car, when one suddenly sighed: “Beneath this ground, who knows how many beautiful palace maidens lie buried, so young sacrificed with the dead, a great pity! If only we could bring up a few to accompany us here!”

After this, they all laughed, indulging in various fancy and fancy alone; but as they laughed, the mirth faded, and their faces grew aghast. After driving some distance, they found themselves again at the same spot; a road that ought to have taken ten minutes was traversed in circles, as if bewitched.

Anxious and frightened, they pressed forward. From dusk into night, they could not escape, always returning to the place they had passed. Then they realised they had encountered the “ghostly wall.” They stopped the car by the roadside, alighted, and lit three incense sticks as offerings, facing the direction of the Thirteen Tombs. Bowing their heads, they apologized. After this rite, they returned to the car and in five minutes reached the resort!

## Reckless Speech: Traffic Accident and Loss of Life

A friend once told me a story: he knew a couple who often quarreled. Once they argued fiercely, breaking many things in the house. The wife shouted at the husband: “Why do you not quickly go and die! If you die, this home will be peaceful!” The husband stamped his foot and ground his teeth, replying fiercely: “Very well! Very well! If I do die, see if you will not repent!”

Such words were but angry words between them. A few days later, they reconciled. But unexpectedly soon after, the husband indeed died! He met with a strange traffic accident — all others in the vehicle escaped serious harm, but he alone lost his life.

## Reckless Speech: I Will Donate My Organs

On the fifth day of the ninth moon, 2014, at Guiyang Normal College, a senior student named Lu Quanwei, whose mother had died a month earlier of kidney disease, suddenly said before his family and friends: “Should misfortune befall me, please donate all my organs to those in need after my death.” None could have foreseen that within a month, this word would be fulfilled, for Lu Quanwei met with a traffic accident on his way home.

## Reckless Speech: Sharp Tongue Brings Oral Cancer and Disfigurement

When I worked at a project department, there was a driver named Zhao Wei. Perhaps because the leadership trusted him greatly, he grew haughty and overbearing before the rank and file, and spoke cuttingly, mocking anyone he met. The modern phrase “poison tongue” was made for him.

Yet to me he was unusually warm, often seeking closeness, hinting at his admiration for my uncle — who at the time was chairman of our parent company.

One morning, Zhao drove his boss to the project and, seeing me, said: “Xiao Zhang, congratulations are due at your home.” I was puzzled: what joy was there at my house? He said: “You do not know? Your uncle has been summoned for tea by the authorities.” At the time I was new to society and ignorant of the meaning of “tea,” thinking my uncle was about to be promoted, and was pleased.

That morning my mother received two calls, and I then understood: my uncle and aunt had been subjected to disciplinary investigation. At lunch in the canteen, Zhao opened the subject, speaking ill of my uncle. He said my uncle had embezzled over a hundred million, kept dozens of mistresses, squandered money, giving my parents only a hundred yuan pocket money per month... All hearsay and groundless accusations. He even inquired publicly: “Xiao Zhang, hurry home and find money, your uncle may have hidden some in your house. Having held power so long, he himself may not know how much he has stolen.”

I was so angered I could not speak, for indeed my uncle and aunt were under investigation, and rightly so; I could not refute Zhao. Yet yesterday his warmth had been boundless, and today he shamed me before all for my uncle’s faults. I thought this man terrible. That was the first time I experienced his poisonous tongue.

This year I unexpectedly heard that Zhao had oral cancer, fortunately detected early. Though now cured, half his face was excised and disfigured. Upon meeting him again, he had become silent and seldom spoke.

## Reckless Speech: Death of a Colleague Twenty Years Past

Yesterday I travelled to company headquarters and went to the archives to attend to business. While searching files, I found a familiar name in a “deceased employee archive” — Wang Qing. I was astonished. Further perusal showed Wang Qing had only retired in 2017, then soon after died.

Wang Qing and I were colleagues twenty years ago. I had just graduated as a laboratory analyst. He was then about forty, the boss’s driver; we young ones called him Brother Qing. He was fair and plump, hair combed back, and walked with great bearing. The boss was small and thin. Clients often mistook Brother Qing for the boss, bypassing the latter to shake his hand.

When I first knew Brother Qing, he introduced his background, saying even the boss must give him due respect. I held him in esteem as a senior. Later, one day, he called me to his room to get something. When I entered, he closed the door, saying he wanted me to watch a film. I thought it was a company secret, so I sat seriously waiting for him to play the disc. Instead, it was a pornographic film, and I fled in fright. Afterwards, he treated me with cold indifference and occasionally warned me in veiled words.

Brother Qing was not only unprincipled but spoke most cuttingly. One day, our lab had rubber sheets ready for disposal after testing, and a worker said he needed one at home, so I gave him one. Brother Qing saw this. He knew all along these were waste to be discarded, but he made a fuss, accusing me of taking company property to curry favour, reporting me to the boss and spreading ill words. I could not contend with him and left him to it.

After two years as colleagues, I resigned and never saw Brother Qing again. Others often mentioned him as unpleasant, always mocking and ridiculing, delighting in finding fault and punishing others. Others mocked for self-interest; he mocked for pleasure, gaining notoriety for ill repute.

Yesterday I asked an old colleague, Tan, about Brother Qing’s death. Though once I disliked him, time had passed and I had let go. Hearing of his death, I felt somewhat uneasy.

Tan said: “Don’t mention it, alas, how tragic! Tongue cancer; he had several operations...” Before he spoke, I had guessed it might be a disease of the mouth and tongue, and indeed it was!

## Reckless Speech: Death Oath over Five Jin of Pork

In the late 1980s, a schoolmate working as secretary at an ironworks in the countryside told me a story of an oath that remains vivid in my memory. The ironworks was to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Before the holiday, employees went home, and five jin of pork were bought for the night watchman left at the factory, to be eaten during the feast. The cook and watchman were both present.

Soon thereafter, the five jin of pork vanished. The watchman said the cook had taken it; the cook denied it. The two argued bitterly.

Onlookers were puzzled, uncertain whether the cook had taken the meat or the watchman wrongly accused him. To prove their innocence, at noon in the factory yard, both burned incense and swore solemn oaths: the watchman vowed that if he falsely accused, he would die on the fifteenth day of the eighth month; the cook vowed that if he took the pork, he would die on that day.

The spectators laughed and took no heed, dispersing.

On Mid-Autumn Day, the cook died. Those who disbelieve oaths see this as coincidence; those who believe see it as retribution.

## Reckless Speech: The Keyboard Warrior

At the end of the Ming dynasty, in Suzhou, lived a scholar surnamed Qin, bright and learned, versatile, especially skilled in composing poetry. His mind was quick, and he could instantly compose verses. His flaw was a proud and caustic nature, speaking harshly and displeasing others. When he saw faults in others, he composed poems to attack them; when hearing of ridiculous matters, he turned them into songs.

One neighbour had a scandalous affair of man and woman. Upon learning this, he immediately wrote ten songs in the tune of “Yellow Oriole,” mocking the matter in vivid and explicit terms. The songs spread far and wide. Because of this, he was beaten many times, even stripped and flogged in the street. Once again, for making songs to satirize others, he was falsely accused and prosecuted. His old habits proved too strong to change.

In his old age, he contracted malaria. After recovery, he soon became mentally deranged, often eating his own excrement and cutting his tongue with a knife. Fortunately, family found and took the knife from him. They could do no more but confine him to an empty room. Unable to find a knife, he began biting his own tongue bit by bit, spitting out the blood. The room smelled fetid and sickening, yet Qin himself was unaware.

One day, through a crack in the window, he saw an axe for chopping wood. He broke the window, seized the axe, and killed himself with it.
