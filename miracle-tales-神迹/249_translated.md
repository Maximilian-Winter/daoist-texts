# This Is Not the Place for You to Come

From my childhood I was brought up by my grandfather. Many years have passed since he departed from this world; I miss him greatly. But with the lapse of time, many things which were not recorded in writing then I now only remember in outline. While I yet retain these memories, therefore, I make this record, and am willing to share with all the strange and wondrous world.

My grandfather from youth was a man of great spirit. He was very clever, and his memory was such that nothing escaped him. Skilled in the arts of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, he was well versed in all these. When grown, he went to study education, and became a teacher of great renown in our county. Yet his body was frail, and he was subject to fainting at the sight of blood; thus in his youth he did not follow the elder generation in the study of medicine, but trod the path of education.

Grandfather told me he was the youngest son in his family. When my great-grandfather and great-grandmother bore him, they had already lost about ten brothers and sisters before him; therefore when he was born he was especially cherished. From his birth he was given to worship thirty-six godfathers of various trades among the common people; he had godfathers skilled in juggling who carried him through fire and blade (a certain rite). Once when a fire broke out at home, a beggar godfather came to summon aid and saved the whole family.

My grandfather's second uncle, that is, my great-uncle, the younger brother of my great-grandfather, was a barefoot doctor, who specialized in the bones and joints, and was famous in the surrounding ten li of villages. Grandfather said that great-uncle, in curing diseases for many years, could stop blood flowing from a broken leg by spitting a single breath on it; even if the pain was great, he could touch the broken bone and immediately all cries ceased; there was no bone he could not put in place, and so the ten li round all called him the divine healer. Grandfather saw many times from childhood how wonderfully great-uncle set bones and saved lives, and so he wished to study medicine with him; but great-uncle refused, saying his body was too weak to endure such hardships, and instead taught him the arts which he himself had learned.

Grandfather said that great-uncle called his learning the arts of Maoshan, which required that at times he would select a deep mountain forest, and carry a bowl of clear water in to cultivate there. During this time many spirits and monsters would come to drink from the bowl; they must not be disturbed until they had finished drinking. At the last, he would lift the bowl and drink up the water, and only then could his cultivation be complete. Great-uncle said these things could not be spoken to outsiders, for they would harm the cultivation; but now both are departed, I think it may not matter. I suppose I shall in time tell these things to those who come after me; I seek not their belief, but the merits accumulated by my forebears I hope may be remembered by some.

My grandfather’s education made him a thorough materialist; he did not believe in ghosts or spirits, but only in science. Yet great-uncle said he could summon spirits to show him, but it might disturb the townsfolk; so grandfather refused. This is the story grandfather told me.

## I: The Story of Myself

In the year when I was an intern, about seventeen years old, studying nursing, rotating through the oncology department, I lodged in a dormitory of eight persons, in a room near the stairs and the lavatory; I slept on the lower bunk near the door. I remember clearly that at midnight someone rose and opened the door, making a loud noise. Though I opened my eyes, I could not see who it was, and thought it was someone going to the lavatory, so I paid no heed. Soon after, the door opened again with the same loud noise; feeling a breeze on my face, I mumbled drowsily, ‘Please shut the door,’ and then heard it close. After a while, the door opened a third time, with a great noise, and the wind blew directly upon my head. I was angry and whispered, ‘Please be quieter.’ The next morning my roommates began to say that nobody had shut the door all night. We counted: there were five of us in the room; the others were on night duty. None had risen during the night, nor opened the door; yet it was open in the morning. A thief was impossible, for the door was of the type fastened with a latch bolt locked from inside, and could not be opened from outside; any opening would make great noise. Nor could it be my roommates, for it was winter and very cold; the dormitory had no heating, and if the door were open all would have caught colds. When my colleague and I reached the ward, the nurse who guided me said that three of the elderly patients I cared for had died during the night. Those three had suffered great pain during their hospital stay, and I had great respect for them; at that moment I burst into tears.

Later some said that perhaps the souls of those three old men had inadvertently followed me back, and left at night, thus opening the door three times. But if so, I had even shouted at them; so I have ever since felt deep guilt.

## II: The Passing of Grandfather

When grandfather passed away, my family concealed it from me for two days. On the night I returned home I kept vigil, and in the mourning hall I wept hysterically, causing even my eldest brother, a man of iron will, to weep. There is a custom in our home that at the burial and coffining, relatives must not weep, lest it bring misfortune upon the deceased’s descendants. So my two uncles and one uncle-in-law forcibly took me away, lest I attend the funeral, knowing I could not restrain myself.

That night there was no room at home for me to sleep but the sofa. I could not sleep; when at last I did, I dreamed that at the moment of the coffin being lowered, grandfather’s eyes opened. I was so frightened that I awoke, and immediately called my brother and sister, saying ‘The coffin was just lowered.’ My heart was heavy; I had not accompanied him on his last journey. This is the greatest regret of my life.

Grandmother always thought that after grandfather passed, I kept dreaming of him, and that was why I had such strange dreams. I was not one who dreamed often, but in the year and a half after grandfather’s death I dreamed of him almost every night; no one else did. I thought he could not let me go because I had not seen him off on his last journey.

Yet one night I dreamed that grandfather took me up to the rooftop to fly kites. He wore the pink and white shirt he most loved. I looked at him, happily going up with him; but my heart was filled with sadness, knowing he was no longer of this world.

On the rooftop I played joyfully with him. Suddenly he turned and said, ‘You already know I am no longer in this world, do you not?’

I could not hold back tears, but dared say nothing, fearing to speak ill of him. He stood there, still as slender as ever, and said, ‘I will no longer disturb you. Take good care of yourself. Today is the last time I shall see you; I am going to be reborn.’ Then he vanished.

I awoke wailing aloud. I knew I would never see him again. Since then, I have never dreamed of him. I think such a perfect man as grandfather must surely be reborn into a good family.

## III: Other Incidents

During the National Day holiday when I returned home to perform ancestral rites, I slept in the bed grandfather once used. The others feared to do so, but I was not afraid; he loved me most in life, why should I fear? That night I slept late; I remember it was eleven o’clock and five minutes when I looked at my watch, holding my phone in one hand and pulling the quilt with the other. Then I felt a hand grasp mine.

Turning, I saw a black humanoid figure holding my hand. I was strangely glad, thinking at last I had seen a ghost. I tried to remember its form carefully, while it led me out of the bedroom. Outside the bedroom door it let go; I followed willingly, wondering where we were going. We entered a wood.

Here and there I saw hurried faces. We went on a very long time, as if for days. We boarded a crowded train, open at the sides like a mist, without doors, with people continually getting on and off. The shadow I followed pushed forward alone; I could not see where it went; I resolved to get off at once.

Getting off was like falling into an abyss. When I rose I found myself on a black awning boat, with two white lamps burning at the prow.

The boat was tall; I struggled to climb down and saw I was in a narrow place, with what seemed coffins hung on both sides. A middle-aged man was sawing something. I politely asked him, ‘Uncle, may I ask where this is?’

The man raised his head, laid down his saw, and looked at me strangely. I recall he spoke sternly: ‘This is not the place you should come. Go back quickly! Go back quickly!’ while pushing me towards the boat.

Perceiving I was taken to a place of ill omen, I grew anxious and began to walk back. I asked him, ‘Is it back onto the boat?’

‘Yes, hurry back; this is not the place for you!’

Having a clear answer, I ran toward the boat. Suddenly a child appeared. The man seemed afraid of the child; I realized danger and hastened to climb aboard. The child ran after me, pulling at me. ‘Sister, don’t go! Stay and play with me.’

Knowing I must not anger him, I crouched and said, ‘Baby, sister still has some matters; I will play with you next time, alright?’

‘No, I want you to play with me now.’

Feeling ill at ease, I no longer hesitated but climbed onto the boat with all my might. The child was too weak to pull me back; in anger it extinguished the two lamps at the prow.

Suddenly I felt my body falling, falling without end, as though my entrails were breaking. I fell heavily upon the bed, my whole body about to come apart.

At that moment I felt the pillow beneath my head. I knew I had returned.

Still dazed, I pondered all that had happened, unable to distinguish reality from illusion.

Then I dimly saw a party pass over my bed, similar to those who had taken me away. Among them was one dressed in splendid clothes, unlike the others. He shone with light. Curious, I reached out and grasped his hand. When he turned, I was astonished to see not a human face but the face of a horse.

He asked me, ‘Do you know me?’

I looked at him in amazement, at his radiance which was truly warm; I asked a foolish question, ‘Are you a god?’

He stopped, as if to say, ‘Do not fear.’ He sat slowly beside my bed. I was deeply moved, for the warmth was so great. I watched him sitting, his light gradually fading; then I felt strength to rise.

Later I glanced at the clock; it was only eleven twenty-five. But it seemed to me as if many days had passed.

Even now I am filled with lingering dread at the event. I am grateful to the uncle who pushed me back, and grateful to that radiant adult. I know not if I truly saw that being, but in that moment the warmth dispelled all my fears. Should I meet him again after a hundred years, I would surely say, ‘Thank you.’
