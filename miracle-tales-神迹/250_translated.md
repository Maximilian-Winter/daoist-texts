# The Penitent Worship on the Day of the Thunder Fast by the Daoist Brother Lei

There came a certain Daoist brother who sought lodging and visit, and he was admitted without hindrance. Daily he took part with us in the morning and evening devotions, and lived with us in gladness. At that time the monastery ordained that on the day of the Thunder Fast a day must be set apart for the penitent worship. The rites of the Thunder Altar called for the faithful to be summoned in every day, and it was not the custom to come forward at once to light incense and begin to kneel in worship; such was not the method.

The requirements for worship and repentance in the monastery were exceedingly strict. It was commanded that the lights should be dim, not too bright. This was like the custom of “entering the quiet and passing over first” — it was held that in darkness men might better illuminate their hearts; to deceive not the dark chamber was the best repentance. Because of this principle, at night we are often most clear in our thoughts; and this was the state required by the monastery. When the worship and repentance drew to a close, the lights were raised to full brightness, symbolizing the breaking through of darkness, the Heavenly Lord bestowing light, and the confession of one’s sins bringing illumination. According to the Master, this was to pass from death to life, from the nether hell to ascend to the hall of blessings.

At the time of worship and repentance, at every utterance of the name of the Heavenly Lord, all prostrated themselves and knocked their foreheads to the ground. When the drum sounded thrice, and after the sound of the temple chime was heard, then was it permitted to rise. This space of time, of some three to five seconds, was to allow the penitent to prostrate and reflect upon the errors committed. The drum was like thunder, reminding at every moment that the nether judgment is accompanied by peals of thunder. There were many such customs. For example, upon entering the quiet chamber, an inspector stood at the door with the rod of discipline in his hand, clad in neat official robes.

This Daoist brother twice missed the penitent worship on the days of the Thunder Fast, each time by some mishap. On one such day, he began to worship with us. All was as usual, when suddenly his voice rose in pitch, accompanied by sobbing, crying aloud: “Arising thoughts and motions, wanton and wilful deeds, profaning the holy and true, daring to affront Heaven and Earth, defiling wind and rain, exposing the stars, opposing lord and teacher, disobeying parents, oppressing the weak and orphaned, contemning kinsfolk and friends, slaying living creatures, scattering the Five Grains, weighing with false scales and small measures, men numbering hundreds and thousands, cruel punishments and severe penalties, forcible invasions and wrongful usurpations.”

At that moment I thought: here is true sincerity. Yet this brother repeated only this one verse; after one recitation, he struck his head to the ground with great force. After but a few bows, his head was broken, and blood slowly ran down his face, a most terrible sight. The brother seemed out of control, with a strange insistence repeating only this verse, striking his head one after another, with such force that even to behold it was painful. Our original plan for worship was thrown into confusion. After some twenty or so bows, my senior uncle knelt before the image of the deity, saying: “We beseech the Heavenly Grace, to spare him for now.” The Master and the other elder Daoists also knelt, saying: “Spirit Officer, we pray your mercy, and let this warning be transmitted to teach future generations; this too is merit.” Such was the general purport, and I shall not repeat all their words lest I weary the reader.

When these words were spoken, the brother ceased, and fell headlong to the ground. We hurried to his side, lifting him with many hands to the dormitory. His wounds were wiped with towels, while the worship went on. I saw that the wounds were not deep, but his eyes were wide with terror, his pupils visibly dilating and contracting. Yet he was silent, trembling now and then.

When all was arranged, one was left to watch and care for him. We gathered ourselves and returned to the great hall to continue the worship. Four days passed before the brother regained some consciousness. No one asked what had happened, but all speculated as to his condition. According to the degree of our sect’s Daoist methods, it was not likely that any evil spirit had entered here.

Curious, I asked the Master, who smiled and told me I would know in a few days. After two days, the brother came to the Master and senior uncles, and sat with them in the courtyard. He said he must take his leave, and expressed deep gratitude for their care and hospitality. At that time, the steward of the monastery was my senior uncle, who said to the brother: “To cultivate the Way, one must guard the spirit-seat of the heart, never lose the true mind, and not betray Heaven and Earth. Be careful to conduct yourself rightly!”

The brother bowed his head for a long while, then spoke of what had happened in the great hall and of his past deeds.

It transpired that this brother had entered the Way not for cultivation, but solely for wealth; and afterwards, finding not only riches but also the respect of others, he became elated. He bought talismanic books; because he wrote characters finely, the talismans he copied were very beautiful and sold at high prices, yet continued to sell without end. Having grown rich, he began to look down upon his Master, showing less reverence in word and deed. Entering Taoism for money alone, he held no true respect or awe for the Immortals, and his daily offerings of incense were mere formalities. He broke precepts, eating meat, and quarreled without cease. If devotees did not seek his rites or buy his talismans, he would harass and threaten them unceasingly until they purchased his wares, then he would relent.

Upon hearing this, I understood why he repeated only that one verse: “Arising thoughts and motions, wanton and wilful deeds, profaning the holy and true, daring to affront Heaven and Earth, defiling wind and rain, exposing the stars, opposing lord and teacher, disobeying parents, oppressing the weak and orphaned, contemning kinsfolk and friends, slaying living creatures, scattering the Five Grains, weighing with false scales and small measures, men numbering hundreds and thousands, cruel punishments and severe penalties, forcible invasions and wrongful usurpations.”

His arising thoughts and motions were indeed reckless and unrestrained, wanton and wilful. He did not follow the Great Way, did not serve the ancestral teachers, bore evil intent, violated his oaths, and profaned the Immortal Truths, daring to affront Heaven and Earth. He disrespected his Master, even speaking insolently, and disobeyed lord and teacher. Breaking precepts by eating meat, lodging at houses of prostitution, he committed forbidden acts.

On that day, in the great hall, he suddenly felt dazed, and saw before him a mighty King Spirit Officer, glaring angrily. At his sides stood two golden-armored generals; one grasped his head, and he lost control of himself. A loud voice chanted: “Arising thoughts and motions, wanton and wilful deeds, profaning the holy and true, daring to affront Heaven and Earth, defiling wind and rain, exposing the stars, opposing lord and teacher, disobeying parents, oppressing the weak and orphaned, contemning kinsfolk and friends, slaying living creatures, scattering the Five Grains, weighing with false scales and small measures, men numbering hundreds and thousands, cruel punishments and severe penalties, forcible invasions and wrongful usurpations.” His mouth repeated the words involuntarily. Only when the Daoist elder pleaded did it cease. He was left dizzy and unable to move.

The next day the brother departed. I know not when he left, nor have I seen him since. Yet this matter has remained in my heart. From then on, I often performed worship and repentance, mostly the Thunder Penitent Rite. True repentance begins in the heart and ends in conduct. One must repent in the heart and cease the wrongful deeds; this is genuine repentance. The brother once said that many times he could feel Heaven’s warnings, but still attributed them to chance or unexplained matters, making excuses for himself, and continued in wanton acts.

To keep the precepts is not mere lip service; it must be truly upheld from the heart.
