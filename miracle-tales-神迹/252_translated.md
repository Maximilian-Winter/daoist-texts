# Wei Gao Commands the Yellow Register to Verify the Ritual

When the Grand Commandant and Director of the Secretariat, Prince of Nankang Wei Gao, administered the affairs of Chengdu, he caused to be opened a new southern market beyond the Wanli Bridge, across the river. Graves were exhumed, and streets and markets were filled in and constructed. In a short space of time, upon the southern bank of the river, there were new men and new houses; pavilions, terraces, towers, and halls with carved beams and painted rafters; the crowds thronged together, a scene of surpassing beauty.

But when evening came at sunset, all were seized with alarm and trembling; sand and stones flew about, and the howling of ghosts and wolves was incessant. This was because, at the time of opening the new district, no graves were relocated, nor were there altars set up to pray and make offerings; instead, the graves were merely filled in. This was but the mere semblance of a rite, as is commonly said. Since the spirits and souls of the ghosts could find no resting-place, the market could not be fully and properly completed.

When Wei Gao learned of this, he summoned Taoist priests to establish a Yellow Register ritual ground there, with sincere repentance and confession.

After two days thus, on the third day, the howling of ghosts ceased; the inhabitants of the place obtained peace. Wei Gao dreamed that immortals spoke to him, saying: "In your ordering of the southern market, you have built the new district upon graves, causing the shades and ghosts of the nether world to lose their dwelling-places and be bereft of their bones; they sorrowed deeply, and a great calamity was nearly wrought.

By the efficacy of the Yellow Register ritual ground, these ghosts were delivered; Heaven pardoned more than thirty thousand spirits, who by virtue of the merit of this ritual, took their rebirth and transmigration. Henceforth, the people dwelling here might live in peace, needing no longer to fear disturbance. Wei Gao was much amazed, and he composed the Record of the Yellow Register, setting up a stone monument in the True Talisman Temple to commemorate it."
