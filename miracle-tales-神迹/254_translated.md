# The Three Officials Scripture Recited by Zhao Guohai of Shandong and Its Responsive Efficacy

Zhao Guohai, a native of Heze in Shandong, was a man diligent in his labours; yet his fortune was adverse and depressed. What he undertook mostly failed, and for nearly thirty-one matters he achieved no success. Moreover, he was often troubled by evil dreams, in which appeared a woman, her hair dishevelled and loose. Sometimes she lay beside his bed; sometimes she stood in a corner, gazing vacantly at him. His family, perceiving that there must be a cause in this, went about burning incense and worshipping the spirits, seeking a means to dispel the perplexity.

Once, he came to the Taiqing Palace on Mount Laoshan to burn incense. The Daoist priest, after seeing Zhao Guohai, said, ‘There is a young woman who follows you about. This is the result of the karma you wrought in a previous life.’ Zhao Guohai, upon hearing this, was struck dumb, for what the priest said agreed with the figure he saw in his dreams. Bowing his head, he inquired, ‘What is the matter indeed?’ The priest said, ‘In your former life you wronged this woman, and promised to marry her; but you never fulfilled your promise. She died bearing a grievance. Her heart is full of resentment, and so she haunts you continually.’

Zhao Guohai was greatly astonished and felt deep remorse; he asked, ‘Is there a good method by which this may be resolved?’ The priest said, ‘First, you must repent sincerely; secondly, you must perform the Yellow Register Purification Ceremony to send this lady away.’ Zhao Guohai hastened to say, ‘Then pray, Daoist priest, help me now to deliver this creditor of enmity and debt!’

The priest replied, ‘Sin and karma arise from the heart. If your repentance be not sincere, the deliverance will be but temporary. Return home and fast and reflect upon your faults for one month, and then come to see me again.’ After speaking, the priest took out a copy of the Three Officials Scripture and handed it to Zhao Guohai, saying, ‘Go back and recite this scripture morning and evening; repent and atone for your sins, and there will surely be a response.’ Zhao Guohai expressed his thanks.

Returning home, according to the priest’s instruction, he burned incense daily, recited the scripture morning and evening, making prostrations and weeping bitterly, with earnest repentance. After more than twenty days, he seldom had evil dreams. His spirit also improved much beyond the former state. After one month, Zhao Guohai again ascended Mount Laoshan to seek the priest, but was told that the priest had already gone forth on his travels.

Nevertheless, Zhao Guohai continued to follow the priest’s teaching. He invited the priest to build a Yellow Register Purification Hall to perform deliverance for his creditors of enmity and debt, and dedicated the merit to all sentient beings in the three realms and ten directions. Furthermore, he resolved to take refuge in the Great Way. From that time his spirit grew better day by day, and his affairs gradually prospered.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: From time immemorial hitherto we have, knowingly or unknowingly, committed errors. These errors are not confined to killing, theft, and licentiousness, but include falsehood, anger, and sometimes a malicious glance may also hurt another. Perhaps we soon forget, but the other person still harbours resentment. Thus they become enemies, and in endless future lives they repay injury with injury. Therefore we ought diligently to practise repentance, often facing the Most High and Perfected Ones, revealing the truth of our hearts, and confessing our sins. If you repent sincerely, the Heavenly Lords will forgive your transgressions; your creditors of enmity and debt, perceiving your repentance, will lessen their hatred. Thus your path in life will become smoother and smoother.
