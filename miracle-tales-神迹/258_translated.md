# A Woman of Luoyang in Henan Offers Sacrifice to the Dipper and Drives Out Evil: A Verified Account

In Luoyang of Henan there was a woman surnamed Sun, who for many years was harassed by malignant spirits. Her body was cold to the touch, and her belly made rumbling noises. At night when she went to sleep, there would be knocking at the door, but when she opened it, there was nothing there. Thus did these disturbances continue for many years. She sought physicians and medicines, but to no avail. She said that when she was in her twenties, after giving birth and resting in confinement at home, she heard a child crying outside her door at night; she opened the door to look, but the child was not there, and a light flew into her body. She saw a man in the courtyard saying, "That thing is troublesome; I entrust it to your care."

Although Sun was usually like other people, yet the malignant spirit troubled her, and she felt much entanglement; her mind was also not very clear. Many years passed, and in her forties, her countenance was dull, her vital energies wasted, and her hair was streaked with white. She heard that Daoist Priest Rao of Chongzhen Palace on Mount He in Jiangxi excelled in the ancient Lingbao method. Sun had long admired the secret arts of Daoism, which had the power to restore life and save from calamity. Therefore, she came to Guangxin Prefecture to seek out Priest Rao, and prostrated herself begging for relief. The Priest pitied her suffering, examined her fate, and knew that this was a retribution of past grievances now fulfilled, and that he could provide deliverance. He accordingly acceded to Sun’s request.

He then established an altar for sacrifice, following the ritual of the Dipper, and burned seven talismans of the North Dipper’s Golden Mysterious Feather. He summoned the heavenly host of the Jade Court’s soldiers and horses, and the spiritual officers of the Dipper Mansion who resolve grievances and untie knots. Each came flying through clouds and lightning, riding cranes and dragons, holding axes and halberds, treading upon auspicious clouds. The gleam of their blades flashed, and the ranks stood firm and majestic. Sun sometimes prostrated herself on the ground, her sweat flowing without ceasing; sometimes she wailed loudly and sighed towards the heavens. The voice, however, was that of a man, not her usual tone. After about the time of a burning incense stick, Sun recovered her senses, her appearance joyous, saying, “Just now it seemed a general came, leading a troop of soldiers, and took away that which was upon me. Now I feel much lighter; I thank Daoist Priest Rao for his kindness!”

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper says, “The Great Sage, the Seven Lords of the Northern Dipper, can dispel malevolent spirits and calamities.” The Northern Dipper is able to resolve all difficulties and rescue those who serve the Dao. The Polar Star Exorcism Sanctuary is specially charged with driving out evil and subduing demons. From this it is clear that these things are not mere empty words.
