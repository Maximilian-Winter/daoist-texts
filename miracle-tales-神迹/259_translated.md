# The Layman of Lanzhou and the Efficacious Talisman of the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains

Layman Wang, a native of Lanzhou in Gansu, set forth on the National Day of the year Dingyou, driving from Lanzhou and going to Nanchang to offer incense. The entire journey was by expressway, and he hastened along the way. Layman Wang revered the Daoist arts, and knew of the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains, a talisman bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West upon Emperor Wu of Han. Worn about the person, it could ward off calamities and transform malign influences. Especially when entering mountains and traversing dangers, or when setting out by carriage, it was most fitting to wear it, to secure safety. Thus he fastened the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains upon his vehicle, so firmly that it required force to remove it. Under the protection of the True Forms, he journeyed in safety throughout.

When the carriage reached Yichang in Hubei, the heavens poured forth a great rain. The visibility upon the expressway was poor, and suddenly he perceived that the vehicle ahead was motionless. It appeared that an accident had occurred, yet the vehicle before had not drawn into the emergency lane nor set up a triangular warning frame. The driver hastened to brake and slow, turning the wheel to change into another lane. At that moment, the talisman of the True Forms, which had been tightly fastened, suddenly fell with a clap. The carriage had not gone far when there came the sound of sudden braking and collision of vehicles. All agreed that the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains had averted a disaster. They devoutly prayed and gave thanks for the great protection of the Dao.

The Treatise Baopuzi says: "The cultivators of the Way, dwelling in seclusion in mountains and valleys, must have the True Forms of the Five Sacred Mountains to wear; then the mountain spirits, demons, tigers, worms, and all malevolent and poisonous things cannot approach them." In the third year of the Yuanfeng reign of Emperor Wu of Han, on the seventh day of the seventh month, he received it from the Queen Mother of the West, and it was disseminated among men. Later, in the early years of the Taichu era, Li Chong, who claimed to be a native of Fengyi and three hundred years old, bore the talisman on a vessel of grass and wandered about. Emperor Wu saw him and conferred on him the title of Master of the Talisman. Therefore, those who wear this talisman may cross rivers and seas, enter mountains and valleys, travel by night in the fields, or lodge by chance in evil houses; all evil spirits, goblins, demons, water monsters, and mountain spirits will all hide and flee, daring not to harm. If kept at home as a shrine, all evil will not arise, and good fortune will ever gather. Hence this talisman is not only worn as a scroll, but may also be framed as a painting for domestic reverence and safe keeping.
