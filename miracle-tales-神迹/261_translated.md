# The Efficacy of the Ten-Character Heavenly Scripture Recited by Zhao Lixian of Yongjia

Zhao Lixian was a man of Yongjia, Zhejiang. He delighted in the Way and sought immortality; yet, being entangled in worldly affairs, he was unable to abandon the household to seek the Way in retreat. Therefore, he practiced cultivation within his home. During the time of the descent of the Nine Sovereign Sages, he devoutly recited the True Scripture of the Northern Dipper. At night, while asleep, he dreamed of a woman, her hair unbound and her robe plain, lying by his side, smiling gently, and pricking his shoulder with a needle. Zhao Lixian was greatly alarmed, yet could not awaken. Then he silently chanted the sacred title, “Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Voice Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable.” Shortly after, with difficulty, he awoke; his shoulder still faintly ached.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Many do not cultivate the Way at all; but when they begin the practice, demons and devils obstruct their path. Why is this? The demon (mo) signifies ‘to grind.’ When the Way is advanced one foot, the demon is advanced ten. In the world there exists an evil ghost, or perhaps an enemy from a former life, who delights in hindering others from cultivating the Way. On the other hand, it is also because the cultivator’s own accumulation of merit and virtue is insufficient. The ‘Treatise on Understanding the True’ says: ‘The Great Way is easy or difficult in its cultivation, beginning with me and with Heaven. If one does not practice and accumulate hidden virtue, multitudes of demons arise to create obstacles.’ Therefore, to attain the immortal Way, one must broadly accumulate hidden virtue and save the world’s people; then spirits will guard and uphold one, and evil demons will retreat afar.

In the process of accumulating virtue, one must not suspend cultivation. What is to be done? One needs the “arts of the Way” to aid in this. For example, the layman Zhao Lixian, when encountering obstruction from demons and devils, would recite the sacred title of the Thunder Venerable. This is the method to resolve difficulties when they arise. Yet this is far from sufficient. The ‘Master who Embraces Simplicity’ says: ‘All who follow the Way and use medicines, and those who flee turmoil to dwell in seclusion, enter the mountains. Yet many who know not the methods of entering the mountains meet with disaster. Hence the saying: “Beneath Mount Taihua, bones lie scattered.” All this is because they only know one thing, and cannot comprehend the whole; though they seek life, they hasten death.’

Therefore, we cultivators, even those refining the inner elixir, should learn the arts of binding the soul and controlling the spirit; not to say that this may save the world and its people, at least it may protect ourselves.”
