# The Miraculous Response of a Good Believer in Bengbu Reciting the Jade Pivot Scripture

The layman Meng, a native of Bengbu in Anhui Province, reverently embraces the Three Treasures, and takes refuge in the Profound Teaching.

This year he planned to purchase a dwelling, and after much selecting he fixed upon a soon-to-be-opened estate in Bengbu. The layman Meng desired to buy a large residence, one of one hundred and fifteen square metres. The estate allotted homes by number. There were one hundred and eight houses, and Meng was number seventy-six; the young lady at the sales office told him, “Even if you can buy a house of one hundred and fifteen square metres, you will not be allowed to choose the floor.”

On the day before the opening, which chanced to be a Xin day, layman Meng at home offered water and flowers, and recited once through the Jade Pivot Scripture. He declared to the Thunder Ancestor his wish to buy a one hundred and fifteen square metre house on a good floor, and prayed that the Thunder Venerable would favour and assist him, so that he might obtain the house of his desire.

On the morning of the opening, Meng’s family said, “This time we can only hope to buy a west-facing house.” But the result was that layman Meng obtained a house on the east side of the sixth floor, one hundred and fifteen square metres in extent.

He deeply felt the power of the Lord of Thunder, the Sovereign of the Nine Heavens, the Universal Transforming Heavenly Venerable of the Sound of Thunder, whose vows are profound and whose response is extraordinary.

The Jade Pivot Scripture says: “The Heavenly Venerable said: I am the Nine Heavens’ True and Clear Great Saint. On the sixth day of each month and on the Xin day of the middle ten days, I watch over all the heavens, and travel through the three realms. If any one desires to learn the Way, to aspire to immortality, to escape the Nine Mysteries, to be freed from the three disasters, he shall command a Taoist of the orthodox Way, or himself with kinsfolk or friends at the temple, or at home, or in the village, to offer water and flowers, and to recite this Scripture. Whether once, or thrice or five times, or even dozens or hundreds of times, he will obtain a clear spirit and a refreshed breath, a broad mind and a full body. Whatever he desires, all will respond to his petition.”

Praise is thus given: Without need of outward things, by breath alone one attains; At the utterance of the venerable name, Heaven and Earth return to Spring.
