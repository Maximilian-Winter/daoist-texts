# The Story of Wu Xiuli of Hebei and the Spirit Infant of a Miscarriage

Wu Xiuli was a native of Lincang in Hebei. At the age of twenty-five or twenty-six, in a certain year, she dreamed of a lump of flesh which leapt into her bosom. But Wu Xiuli was displeased in her heart, and the lump of flesh immediately sprang away, falling upon her younger sister, Wu Xiuying. Upon awakening, Wu Xiuli found the matter strange, and so she related the dream to her sister.

At that time, the younger sister Wu Xiuying was a student at the university; not long afterwards, she entered into a love affair with a young man of the world. Wu Xiuli warned her sister, saying: ‘This man is of an improper character. I have heard that he had a former fiancée, who could not endure his frequent visits to the haunts of women, and so left him. It is best that you do not waste your youth with him.’ But the younger sister did not heed the admonition. Meanwhile, the elder sister Wu Xiuli was busy with her own plans for marriage, and so did not speak further.

Afterwards, the younger sister became pregnant. The family also came to know of this, and asked Wu Xiuying, ‘Will you marry this man? If not, then you must have the child aborted.’ The younger sister thought the man was unreliable, and so went to the hospital to undergo the operation to terminate the pregnancy.

In that year’s Zhongyuan Festival, a great piece of the ceiling fell down in the Wu household. Thereafter, the two sisters often dreamed of an infant, its body stained with blood, baring its teeth and grinning. The younger sister’s temper was much disturbed; at times when she was playing well, suddenly she would lose her temper and say to her sister, ‘It is all your fault.’

The elder sister’s heart was full of remorse; therefore she went to the temple and sought instruction from the Daoist priest, relating the whole matter. The priest said: ‘All things in the world have their due causes and conditions. At the time, you were preparing for marriage, and so the spirit of that infant came to take birth with you. When you did not marry, the infant’s spirit went to your younger sister. In the hidden workings of fate, all is predestined. You need not be overburdened with self-reproach. But since the infant was aborted and failed to be born, the household and dwelling have been disturbed, and the members are not at peace. It is urgently needed to perform the ritual of deliverance, that liberation may be attained.’

Wu Xiuli hastened to bow her head to the ground, and begged, ‘Pray, instruct me in the method of explanation and practice!’ The priest said: ‘Ordinary departed spirits may be freed by the Yellow Register fasting and deliverance rite. Only the spirit of the aborted infant, and women who die in childbirth, the heroic souls who perish in battle, and those spirits who bled much at their death, have their souls confined in the Blood Lake Hell. The lake of blood is deep and dark, beyond the reach of the Yellow Register. It is necessary on the day of Zhongyuan to perform the threefold repentance of the San Yuan method, that their sins and stains may be cleansed; and to hold the great Blood Lake fasting ritual, that the spirits confined in the Blood Lake Hell may be delivered.’

Wu Xiuli earnestly entreated the priest for his compassionate rescue, and presented some offerings of ritual gold, requesting that the priest perform the Blood Lake fasting ritual on Zhongyuan day to deliver the infant spirit. The fasting rite was carried out with solemnity and grandeur; the infant spirit was born again, the family was peaceful and fortunate, and gratitude was given to the Most High for His compassion, who thereby communicated this profound and wondrous method.
