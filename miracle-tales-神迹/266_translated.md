# The Efficacy of the Purple Star's Secret Incantation Water

Tang Suqing was a native of Shiyan in Hubei. His grandfather, Master Tang, was a farmer of the local district of Shiyan. During the time of the Cultural Revolution, the Taoist priests of Wudang Mountain were forced to descend the mountain; Master Tang, moved by great benevolence, cared for the Taoist priests’ food and lodging. The Taoist priests, perceiving his virtuous kindness, instructed him in the recitation of the Scriptures of the Three Officials and the Big Dipper, as well as in some knowledge of Chinese medicine. After the Cultural Revolution, the Taoist priests returned to Wudang Mountain, and no further mention was made. Master Tang devoted his life to thoughts of aiding the world and saving men; those who came from near and far seeking medicine or medical advice, whether rich or poor, were treated equally with all diligence in their cure. The fees for medicine and treatment were left to the intentions of the people, never demanded. Because of this, the children in the household often quarrelled with the old gentleman.

Tang Suqing, from childhood, followed his ancestral teacher in the practice of medicine, climbing mountains to gather herbs. He studied Taoist talismanic methods, and when but a youth of some ten years, was already able to treat diseases by means of talisman-water, with many instances of success. Afterwards, he entered a college of Chinese medicine for further study, and upon graduation took employment at the National Medical Hall in Wuhan. Yet, driven by a fervent desire for the Way, he soon abandoned the Hall and entered the mountains to study Taoism.

In a certain year, Master Tang fell dangerously ill; Tang Suqing returned home to attend to him with decoctions. For more than a month, the old man’s eyes were shut fast. Several times he seemed near death, but each time the decoctions restored him to life. The old gentleman lay sick in bed over a month, until one day his eyes could not be opened, his mouth could not be unclosed, he was speechless, and his breathing was feeble—his symptoms most perilous. Only one hand moved upon the bedclothes, writing the character "Tai" (Peace), as if he wished to say something. In urgent distress, Tang Suqing took a bowl of clear water; with his left hand he made the “Three Mountains” hand seal holding the bowl, and with his right hand formed the “Sword” seal, tracing the Purple Star’s Secret Incantation nine times. He then dipped the sword-finger in the water and anointed the old gentleman’s mouth. The old man then opened his mouth and spoke. He said, “Lord Tai of Mount Tai and the King of Hell have sent the spirits of the underworld to seize me. You must quickly burn paper offerings to send them away.” Tang Suqing sprinkled the water of the method about the room, and hastened to prepare paper money, which he burnt outside the house. Afterwards, Master Tang said, “The Great Emperor of Mount Tai and the King of Hell sent twelve Underworld Officers to seize me; they bound my hands and feet, stuffed cotton in my mouth, and I was nearly dead.”

Master Tang escaped that perilous pass, and to this day remains in the world of the living.

The Iron-Capped Daoist said: The efficacy of the method-water is that of the official generals. The Maoshan method says: “The Taoist methods need not be many; the Southern Dipper pierces the Northern River. They all come down to one character, which subdues the demons of the world.” This character is the Purple Star’s Secret Incantation. The Purple Star Great Emperor is the sovereign of the North Pole, the father and lord of the host of stars. He also incarnates as the Great Emperor of Fengdu, who presides over the affairs of ghosts and spirits of Fengdu; beneath him are myriads of officials and generals, and countless troops. Those who cultivate the Way and study the methods, if they can skilfully use but one Purple Star Secret Incantation, many troubles may be resolved. The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said: “Now, if one but wears one talisman, holds one office, practises one method, and adjudicates one division of the script, before one division of generals and officers, making use but of one talisman and one water, it is only that the heart and spirit are united; used thus, it is efficacious indeed. Just as a true dragon, though but one drop of water, can cause a mighty flood, why need there be so many things?”
