# Morning Worship to the Honoured Lady Bixia of Mount Tai by Shen Aiying of Heilongjiang

Shen Aiying was a native of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang. She had been married many years and yet had no issue. Once she conceived, but after a few months the child was lost. She sought physicians and remedies on all sides; some said it was owing to inflammation of the womb; others said that the husband’s seed was weak; the explanations were various and conflicting. Now she was near thirty years of age, but still there was no movement in her womb. Her household was exceedingly anxious.

One year, Shen Aiying travelled to Dandong, and hearing that the Puji Palace there was a sacred place of the Tao, renowned for its efficacious powers, she went with friends to burn incense and worship the gods. Shen Aiying, deeply intent upon her desire for offspring, after worship drew a lot; the lot’s text was: “Last night the fierce wind blew in the Eastern Garden, and all the myriad flowers were cast down and withered. Fortunately there was a tender flower-lover who rose early, nurturing the root and replanting it so that life was restored.” The Taoist priest who interpreted the lot asked: “What matter do you inquire of?” Shen replied: “I inquire of offspring.”

The priest said: “According to the lot, offspring are hard to obtain; as if all the myriad flowers were blown away by the wild wind. Yet there remains a slender chance of life; one must find the tender flower-lover who will nurture the root and replant, and there is still some hope.” Shen bowed her head and said: “The shaman said it is because in my former life I created much evil karma, that in this life offspring are difficult to come by. I often recite the Kṣitigarbha Sutra to deliver them, but the effect is not manifest. I beseech the priest’s compassion to direct me in the way of resolving this.” The priest said: “The Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak of Mount Tai presides over the retribution of spirits, and the matters of good and evil. The Honoured Lady Bixia of Mount Tai is the goddess who bestows children. Your matter requires worship at the Eastern Peak to repent of your sins, to worship the Honoured Lady Bixia, and to petition for offspring. Moreover, there is a Taoist scripture, the Scripture of the Three Officials, which can forgive the sins of the human world, deliver the departed spirits, and accrue boundless merit; you must diligently recite it.”

Shen bowed her thanks. From then on she vowed to worship at Mount Tai. Her family strongly opposed it, thinking it unnecessary; but Shen was resolute in her purpose.

In the seventh month of that year Shen came to Taian in Shandong; she fasted and bathed, preparing to worship at Mount Tai. Resolute was her intention to ascend the mountain, beginning from the Taishan Temple Gate, performing three kowtows every three steps, chanting the holy name of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak step by step, thus worshipping and repenting her former sins. A temple attendant witnessing this hastened to dissuade her, saying: “On such a hot day, you should rest awhile.” Shen shook her head and continued her prostrations, hoping that the power of the Eastern Peak would discern her heart of repentance. After worshipping at the Taishan Temple, the next day she proceeded up Mount Tai to worship at the shrine of the Honoured Lady Bixia. But by ill fortune, the cable car on the mountain was broken. Shen therefore ascended on foot, walking five or six hours. Arriving at the shrine of the Honoured Lady Bixia, she knelt and kowtowed in repentance, praying the Lady to have compassion and to grant her offspring. After fulfilling her pilgrimage, Shen returned to Heilongjiang.

Not long after her return, about three months later, Shen dreamed that a female immortal descended from the heavens, of surpassing beauty, clad in gauze robes, wearing a phoenix crown. Attended by maidens, one in blue holding a purple book bag, another in red carrying an infant; besides them were innumerable immortal officials and soldiers, bearing banners and standards, protecting her on all sides. The female immortal said: “I am the Honoured Lady Bixia of Mount Tai. In your former life you committed great acts of killing; the Eastern Peak judges clearly between good and evil; hence in this life offspring are difficult. Yet your sincere repentance has moved the deities; relying on the merits of the Scripture of the Three Officials, your enmities are forever dissolved, spirits and humans separated. The Eastern Peak removes your black record and registers your birth. I now come to present to you a qilin child. From now on, you must be diligent.” Having spoken, she commanded the lady in red to place the infant into Shen’s womb, then she rose and vanished. Shortly after, Shen conceived. The following year she gave birth to a son, grateful for the kindness of Mount Tai. She again vowed to carve and print the treasures of the Eastern Peak and the Honoured Lady Bixia, to offer to all directions in thanks for the divine grace.
