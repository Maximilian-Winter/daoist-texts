# The Physician Wang Guoquan of Shiyan, Taught by the Immortals in the Art of Healing

Wang Guoquan, a man of Shahe-dian in Fang County, Shiyan, Hubei, was a very ordinary solitary old man; yet in the healing of diseases he was most extraordinary. He cured without medicines, without acupuncture; only with a bowl of water. He took three incense sticks and, facing the North, invoked prayers; he recited spells and drew talismans; then he bade the patient to drink the water thus consecrated. In general, the sick were healed.

In a neighbouring village there was one who had cancer, and he came to seek Wang Guoquan’s aid. Wang Guoquan said to him, "Five li to the northeast of your dwelling is the tomb of a woman. That woman died from a surgical operation for contraception, and it is now more than twenty years ago. When you went abroad you offended her." The patient returned home and inquired of the elders of the village; they confirmed that indeed such a woman was buried there.

There were those who suffered from inexplicable headaches, and came to see Wang Guoquan. He said, "When you were by the river, you offended the spirit of one who drowned." It appeared that a man had drowned in the river, and as none claimed the body, the police buried it by the riverbank. There were many such occurrences.

Tang Peng, a practitioner of traditional medicine and a cousin of Wang Guoquan, a graduate of a regular medical school and also fond of the mysterious arts, desired to learn Wang Guoquan’s skill. He invited him to a feast, setting a table laden with meats and wine.

Suspecting that it was the practice of the Zhuyou art, he took out the family-inherited book of Zhuyou medicine and showed it to Wang Guoquan. Wang glanced at it and said, "This book is a good book, but I cannot understand it." Dr. Tang was greatly perplexed, and asked Wang from whom he had learned his skill in curing disease.

Wang Guoquan at first hesitated and would not speak; but after a jin of white wine he told Dr. Tang, "I once dreamed of an old man with a white beard, who brought me a bowl of water to drink. The water was bitter and viscous beyond measure; I drank half a bowl, but could drink no more. When I woke, I knew how to heal disease.

Now I somewhat regret it; if I had drunk the whole bowl then, I could have stayed at home and healed without wandering thus." Thereupon Dr. Tang understood that Wang Guoquan’s art of healing was bestowed by the immortals, and could not be learned by others.
