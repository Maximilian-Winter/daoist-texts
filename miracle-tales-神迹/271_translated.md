# The Story of a Certain Master’s Occupation of a Temple Site

In recent days there was a master of fasting whose health was ill; he sought out many physicians in vain, until a friend introduced him to us for aid. Observing his complexion, I said, ‘In your family there is an ancestral offence of taking life.’

He pondered long and said, ‘In our house the elders once slew two birds. Why did they slay those two birds? It was in the year when the family moved the ancestral grave, choosing a place of good feng shui. The ancestral tomb was relocated there. On the day of interment, two birds were chirping beside the place. The elders, with sure aim, picked up a bird-gun and shot them down.’

From that time forth, the elder’s health declined. Afterwards when the elder passed away, his own health also failed. Though he engaged in trade and had wealth, he remained unmarried, now approaching fifty years of age.

I said, ‘You have occupied the ground belonging to the temple; those two birds were perhaps messengers of the temple’s gods, warning your family not to bury there. Alas, they were slain by your kin, and thus this retribution follows.’

I counselled him to make a great vow, striving thereafter to restore the temple to its former state, so that this cause and effect may be resolved. The foundation of the temple’s ground must not be lightly encroached upon; reverence must surely be maintained.
