# The Master of the Way’s Thought Upon the Shoes Left in the Sun

Formerly I heard from an old practitioner a story told concerning a high adept engaged in the ceremony of deliverance. When he was offering food to the departed, suddenly he bethought himself that the shoes left out in the sun had not yet been taken in. Returning after the completion of the ritual, he found that the grains of rice and fragments of steamed bread which had been scattered as offerings had all found their way into the shoes.

This narrative teaches us that in performing deliverance, one must not give way to wandering thoughts. Some may deem this incredible; yet indeed there is a principle underlying it.

The deliverance we now practise is really called “offering and refining.” Offering is offering, refining is refining. We offer to the ghosts and spirits; we refine our own vital spirit. The Daoist Canon says: “Ghosts and spirits have originally no form or shape, being but a single thought.” “For false thoughts do not arise of themselves, and the creation of karma is not without cause; there is ascent and descent in these matters. Therefore one should with a clear and tranquil heart transform their clinging views.”

Ghosts and spirits are but a single thought, and a transformation of the vital spirit. Because of greed, anger, ignorance, and desire, there is the suffering of stagnation. The method of offering and refining is this: by means of one’s own yang energy, one illumines their yin energy. When the Master performs the offering and refining, he keeps in mind the region below the navel as the Fengdu Hell, whence the ghosts and spirits emerge. The region of the heart is the South Prosperous Upper Palace, the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion; the mud pellet brain palace is transformed into the Benevolent Respectful Great One. When offering and refining, the ghosts and spirits are summoned out, refined through the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, and then ascend the mud pellet. The Great One of Salvation from Suffering receives the departed, who rise and ascend in splendour.

Throughout the entire process, the effect of the practice rests entirely on the Master’s concentration. Therefore the Ancestor said: “First one must have within oneself a heart of great compassion, great mercy, great deliverance, and great salvation; not knowing that I am a ghost and spirit, nor that ghosts and spirits are I—forgetting both one and the other is the essential subtlety. One must not be hasty, nor be stirred by sudden impulses. To labour in vain brings no true deliverance. In the midst of stillness and serenity, if this one thought moves, the ghosts and spirits take it as reality, and follow the thought to form illusions. If I think of liberation, they also are liberated. This is to reach the Perfect Way, and they also delight in the Way. In mysterious clarity it is so.”

Because the method of offering and refining depends entirely on the Master’s concentration and spirit, the burning of the departed’s souls, their bathing, and the offering of food are all performed through the Master’s practice. What the spirits perceive is but the Master’s divine consciousness manifesting illusions. If the Master’s mind is suffused with boundless nectar and spiritual food, then the ghosts and spirits are all satisfied and full. But if at that moment the Master’s mind wanders—for example, thinking of the shoes left out in the sun—then naturally the ghosts and spirits will receive this image; and it is no marvel that the food offerings should fall into the shoes which the Master was thinking of.

The place of offering and refining seems to be a place for offering to and refining ghosts and spirits; yet how can it be otherwise than a process of the Master’s own cultivation? Thus the Ancestor said: “The offering and refining is offering to ghosts and spirits, and refining is refining oneself.”
