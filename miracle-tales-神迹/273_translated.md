# The Fishing of Two Carp and the Consequent Performance of the Daoist Ritual

There was a devotee, one who was a lay follower of the temple. In his leisure he delighted in fishing. A few days past he caught two large carp, each about sixty centimetres in length. He had taken great pains.

The carp were placed in a basin, and continuously nodded their heads, as if performing kowtows.

A companion urged him, saying, "Carp will face the Great Dipper; best to let them go." But the man replied, "That cannot be; I have caught them with difficulty."

When driving home, the cart was nearly overturned. Upon entering the house, the yellow dog kept at a distance and barked wildly towards the basin. The companion laughed and said, "This dog also desires the fish today."

That night the fish were cooked in an iron pot and became a dish on the table. That same night he dreamed of two men clad in red coming to demand his life. On the morrow his mouth became exceedingly sore, and gradually began to ulcerate. Though he sought aid at the hospital, there was no remedy.

Therefore he sought out a Daoist priest. The priest said, "These two carp have cultivated for many years and are near to becoming spirits. Today, having been caught and slain by you, they harbour resentment and come to seek revenge. You must hold a ritual, burning many gold and silver ingots, and properly send them off."

The man was greatly frightened, and said, "I will do as you say."

Thus was established a Daoist altar, to perform the ritual for the wronged souls, that they might be born beyond the clouds. He also paid homage to the whole sect of the Three Origins Precious Repentance, repenting of his sins and releasing his grudges. From that time forth, he gradually recovered.

The cultivation of animals is not easy; they fear being caught and slain. In the Legend of the White Snake, the white serpent was rescued by a herdsman. Though the carp were caught and slain, and though this was their fate, if the fisherman had a heart of compassion and had released the carp, the carpâ€™s cultivation would have grown, and he himself would have accumulated merit. Would this not be a thing of beauty? Therefore, in our daily lives, we should cherish benevolent thoughts, and widely cultivate good relations.
