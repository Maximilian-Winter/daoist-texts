# Sayings of the Perfected King of Cloud Rest on Mount Pan

The blind man cannot distinguish the colours green and yellow; the deaf man cannot hear the sounds of pipes and flutes. Is it only the body that is thus? The heart and the mind too are likewise so. As for the original portion of natural innocence, all men possess it complete; but by accumulated dust it is obscured, the correct eye is not clear, and men follow colour and pursue sound, seeking tracks and tracing marks, sinking and drowning in evil paths through countless ages. They strike bamboo tubes and call it sunlight, they beat copper plates and call it the shadow of the sun. If they do not meet a master, how shall they distinguish black from white? Binding themselves in words and phrases only increases their confusion. Thus Master Cloud Rest was constrained to apply medicine to the sickness, to pick the ears and remove the deafness, to rub the brightness and scrape away the film, hoping that all men might see clearly, each open their understanding, so that seeing and hearing, scattering and falling, all might return to the right path, and no longer pursue stray sheep. Liu Gong, a disciple under the Master for many years, carefully recorded the Master’s coughing and clearing of the throat, and collected these into a volume of about a hundred articles, a true guide for those first entering the Way. He ordered them to be carved on woodblocks for wide dissemination. The Recluse of Lone Peak also obtained these for his disciples and juniors. Practitioners who saw them rejoiced, and with purification and reverence composed a dedicatory inscription.

At the beginning of the first month of the year Dingwei, Disciple Lun Zhihuan respectfully prefaced.

## Disciple Lun Zhihuan’s Compilation

When the Master was at Mount Pan he spoke generally, saying: ‘In general, those first entering the Way, if they speak hastily, cannot handle or comprehend, have no foothold, no reliance, will surely give rise to doubt. If the mind is not diligent, one will believe less; if belief is insufficient, one cannot proceed; if proceeding is impossible, one will learn confusedly and disorderly, and after long delay will fall into slackness. Now I will speak to you: what you see before your eyes, what you hear within your ears, what you can believe and follow, go forward with it; from the coarse to the subtle will not mislead you. Even these sounds and colours are the use of the Way. How can one know what is to be believed? Do you not see the vast void, the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains, waters, winds and clouds? Is it not clearly seen before your eyes? This is the model of cultivation, the gateway to enter the Way. Moreover, as the clouds issue from the mountains, they come and go without thought, floating free, hung not upon the scenes or objects; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the winds stir and blow, impelling myriad things, coming and going swiftly, without abiding, leaving no trace; the grass, trees and forests are no hindrance; they pass swiftly on; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the great mountains, towering and lofty, steady and firm, not shaken nor moved, all things that come touching them cannot prevail; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as water, its nature soft and yielding, benefiting grasses and plants, not contending with things, adapting to form and roundness, its essence clear and pure; so that when accumulated it forms rivers and seas, accommodating the hundred streams without distinction, embracing fish, turtles, shrimps and crabs all together; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the sun and moon, whose light necessarily shines, impartial and unselfish, bright and clear in all directions, never sleeping day or night, shining without bounds; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the sky above, its body ever clear, clear yet accommodating, covering all things, benefiting without harm; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the earth, peaceful and unmoving, bearing all things, without faction or partiality; so the heart of the Daoist should be. Again, as the vast void, boundless and without limit, accommodating all, embracing all, knowing yet unfeeling, heaven covering and earth sustaining, embracing without distinction, neither moving nor still, neither being nor non-being, not apart from myriad things, not separate from myriad things, having the clarity of heaven, the stillness of earth, the brightness of sun and moon, the transformations of myriad things; the void is one; so the heart of the Daoist should be. The Way is like heaven and earth; its use is such. Abiding therein, with diligent cultivation day by day, it will be naturally attained; the motions and uses accord with the Way and have their own master. If you seek further words and thoughts in the dead end, you lose it. Having entered the profound gate, each should strive diligently.’

Someone asked, ‘For beginners who cultivate the heart and ground, how shall they enter the gate?’ He answered, ‘Cut off all the attachments of former love and affection, all schemes and calculations, all plotting and counter-plotting; cleave in two and cast away. Also cast away all attached wine, lust, wealth, qi, right and wrong, self and others, clinging and desires, selfish and evil thoughts, desires for gain and passion; cease all one by one. If externally you are unburdened, the body is light and free; if internally unsoiled, the heart is light and free; after long practice there will be no false thoughts. Furthermore, at every moment guard and attend to your words, regulate your eating and drinking, lessen your sleep; outwardly help one another; when dust and filth are cleansed, leaving not one thing behind, then at another time your original fate and primal spirit will naturally appear and enjoy freedom; this is the supreme Daoist indeed.’

Someone asked, ‘How may the cultivator attain purity and tranquillity?’ He answered, ‘When the heart does not follow things, this is called a settled heart. When the heart does not love things, this is called an empty heart. When the heart is settled and empty, this is purity and tranquillity. Purity and tranquillity are the Way.’

Someone asked, ‘Many say the cultivator removes passions and desires; is there a principle beyond this?’ He answered, ‘Once passions are removed, reach to no passion; once desires are removed, attain to no desire. When there is no passion and no desire, what is this Way of yours?’

Someone asked, ‘The cultivator must not be bewildered; how does one attain not to be bewildered?’ He answered, ‘At first your cultivation is unrefined; coming and going without knowing, unable to restrain indulgence; when meeting situations and things, you always follow and go after them, dull and confused, only when you are trapped do you stop, not knowing yourself; this is bewilderment. It is like transmigration, unconsciously entering another shell, only after expending the debt will you return; this is bewilderment. If you rely on knowledge and awareness, you will be bewildered by knowledge and awareness. The cultivator, if at all times in the day carefully inspects himself, not defiled by any mark, lightly passing through all situations and things, this is not bewilderment.’

Someone asked, ‘How should one guard the nature and life?’ He answered, ‘If within the myriad dust realms you come and go entangled, though responsive and harmonious, you must be your own master. Do not always follow after others; matters should not obstruct the heart, heart should not obstruct matters. Like guarding the eyes, if there is a speck of dust the eye closes to reject it. Thus guarding long will show effect. But if the heart is receptive, then it is led away by other things, and cannot be master.’

Someone asked, ‘If thoughts follow one another unceasingly and cannot be swept away, what then?’ He answered, ‘Sweep the heart ground with morning sun; the more you sweep, the less tranquil it becomes; if you want the heart ground to be tranquil, leave behind the branches and leaves.’ The questioner bowed in thanks.

Someone asked, ‘Those who have cultivated must first set their resolve; how shall they set their resolve?’ He answered, ‘In every movement and stillness, in all situations, in walking, standing, sitting and lying down, every thought should be in the Way. When meeting demons do not change; when encountering harm do not move; in peaceful places be the same; in perilous places be the same. Devote this one body, without looking back. Diligently advance straight forward, fearless of life and death; this is a man of resolve. Therefore the scripture says: “The strong in action are those who have resolve.”’

When the Master arrived at the Southern Palace, at the Changzhen Temple he sat with the assembly at night and spoke generally: ‘Beginners who leave home are not yet able to stand alone; they must rely on the monastic community. Some form companions in the Way, aiding one another in succession, so as not to be partial or biased. Yet there are three kinds: there are cloud companions and rosy friends, there are good companions and wise friends, and there are wild companions and strange friends. All who have resolve and integrity, cultivate the heart ground, investigate guilt and merit, sever worldly attachments, and roam freely beyond, seeking like-minded friends, these are called cloud companions and rosy friends, because their hearts are like clouds and rosy mists, worldly affairs cannot impede them. Then there are those who study scriptures and teachings, play qin, read books, recite poems, speak widely, praise and blame rightly and wrongly; these are called good companions and wise friends, because though they do not cultivate the heart, they cannot do evil. Then there are another class who do not cultivate the heart ground, do not look to the scriptures, do not consider guilt or merit, speak incorrectly, act wildly, start quarrels at the slightest touch, boast and show off, rely on strength to win, oppress the good, band together in parties; these are called wild companions and strange friends. After death, each has their place of settling and destination according to their merit and deeds. The cloud and rosy friends ascend to the formless, revel in the Jade Capital, some become immortals, some become heavenly officials. The good companions and wise friends have worldly hearts not yet exhausted, do not leave human relations, and come and go in retribution. The wild and strange companions receive offerings from all directions, but have no merit to repay their debts of speech; some fall to Fengdu, some to lower births, suffer in painful paths. When it comes to this, regret is too late. The wise and clear should carefully consider and each seek their own advantage.’

Someone asked, ‘How is the awakened nature known?’ He answered, ‘Pointing east and drawing west, such empty talk is vain; better to make some real effort. Suppose on the mind there are feelings, desires, vexations, ignorance of self and others; it may be likened to a great glass well before you, if you do not care for it even a little, you will fall into it and never come out through myriad kalpas. If you first see and recognise this and wish to step in, you must quickly retreat. It is this urgent retreat and care which is your awakened nature. If you clearly fall into the pit of self and others, yet still point to emptiness and speak of things above, what business is that of awakened nature?’

Someone asked, ‘What is fixing the nature?’ The Master moved nearer, sat upright and was silent for a long while. Then he said, ‘What you ask about fixing the nature, that person is not yet aware.’ A master nearby arose and bowed in thanks. The Master said, ‘Zhang Gong drinks wine; Li Gong is drunk.’ The man laughed heartily and no more was said.

Someone asked, ‘The beginner pursues the great matter of life and death, but is not clear, and falls into madness and disorder; what is the meaning of this?’ He answered, ‘If one thought has no birth, then there is no death. If one cannot do so, it is because on the mind there are feelings, on the nature there is dust; the feelings and dust play, life and death do not cease. If you desire liberation, meet and send off (thoughts) as they come; send them off again and again, until not a trace remains, the original source is pure and clear. Do not follow sound or colour; be free everywhere, empty, tranquil and easy; enduring as heaven and earth, naturally knowing the true master. For when the mind is correct, all affairs are correct; when the mind is perverse, all affairs are perverse. If within there is a master, then love of people ceases, the six senses become empty, the true essence is ever still; what death or life is there to fear? If you reach this state, yet are ever unable to collect and restrain, hiding and unable to stay, as if possessed by spirits and demons, running wild without control, this is dispersal of spirit and qi, no mastery. You call this true joy and true pleasure but do not know that joy without joy is true joy, pleasure without pleasure is true pleasure, knowledge without knowledge is true knowledge. Now you are driven by the knowing spirit, evil qi enters the heart, and you run wild without remedy. Old men sang and danced in olden times, not knowing that then they were unbinding and releasing, gaining elsewhere, taking joy therein; how would they allow their hearts to run wild and stagger, deceiving the world?’

Someone asked, ‘With eyes open there are dusty realms, with eyes closed there are dream realms; in the crowd there are adverse and favourable circumstances; how may one attain peace and stability?’ He answered, ‘Cultivators take gathering the heart as their root; when meeting adverse circumstances, joyfully pass through; when meeting favourable circumstances, without mind pass through; all dusty realms do not concern themselves. Among the crowd, even a three-year-old child dares not oppose or offend; those usually treated leniently; all who oppose and offend oneself are always to be endured. Endure and forgive, this is the task. All who respect you, all hardships you bear; after long experience the heart ground is mature, peaceful and stable wherever you are. In all situations pass through ordinarily, with no disturbance of mind; towards all circumstances and myriad conditions the heart is stable, not touched by a speck of dust, pure and clear, not dark by day or night; this accords with the heart of sages.’

Someone asked, ‘Knowing one, all things are completed. It is also said: embrace the origin and guard the one; what then is the one?’ He answered, ‘It is the nature of undifferentiated unity, the time before distinctions. Once you know this, if you fall into numbers, you can no longer be one. From one arises two, from two arises three, from three arises ten thousand; how then can you guard it? Better to harmonize with one and be without it. Therefore the Ancestor said: “Embracing the origin and guarding the one is cultivation; enduring and eternal, the one is also nothing.” This one, though nowhere to be found, clearly reveals one’s own original portion, yet is not nothing. Therefore the scripture says: “Knowing emptiness is not emptiness, knowing form is not form; this is called illumination.”’

Someone asked, ‘Monks study the ancient koans; some study scriptures; some ask whether the ancient teachings illuminate the heart; how?’ He answered, ‘Cultivators first refine their own heart, entering from the ordinary to the sage. Since leaving home, they have not been willing to make the heart their matter, only seeking phrases and words of others, making the writings on paper their livelihood, pursuing a few strokes of ink, entangling themselves in confusion, exhausting their effort; what do they gain? When the Elder Yan comes to summon, not a sentence can be used, not a word obtained. Better not to know anything, to pass the days dimly, somewhat alike. Now apply the effort you have to seek after your own original portion, then you do not waste time. What is your own original portion? Simply to hold the one point of spirit and brightness of the body, to observe and receive from the Way since antiquity till now, clear and constant; what more do you desire? When you have verified the principle clearly, this is your evidence for transcending the ordinary and entering the sage. If you can believe and apply this, then make diligent use of it. Your own case is like this; why count others’ treasures? Quickly receive and use it; from now on do not be deceived by others.’

The Master once had labourers and spoke generally: ‘In former times under the East Hall there was an Immortal Zhang, a carpenter, who never opposed others, humble and gentle, never showing anger in his countenance. All gave him approval and often praised him, so he was heard of by the Perfected. The Perfected said: “Not yet; try him first.” Like gold unrefined, without trial the true and false are not known. One day he was ordered to make a seat; the man responded and made it. Before finishing, he was ordered to make doors and windows; he followed along quietly. Before even half was done, he was ordered to make several boxes; the man then refused. He argued before the Perfected, wishing to finish one thing before making another. The Perfected said: “Formerly because all approved you, you could respond without opposition, never moved in heart; today we try if you can let go. Cultivators, when refining heart and responding to affairs, must have a master within, be at ease and harmonious; outwardly respond to affairs, hitting the mark every time. Which is first, which is last? All are false things, what fixed essence is there? The heart must die, the mechanism must live; just attend to the present pressing affairs, calmly and steadily, unmoved and unclouded; this is called constant response and constant stillness.”’

Someone asked, ‘Some say karma extends through three lives; is this so?’ He answered, ‘Have you not heard the ancients say: When finished, the obstacles of karma are originally empty; when unfinished, you must repay your old debts. In former times there was a man with a foul sore on his back, the pain intolerable, pus and blood flowing; he withdrew to a lonely place and hanged himself. Such a man neither understood his own nature nor was willing to bear the debts of pus and blood from past lives; though he caused his own death, when he reappears he will still have to repay it. How do we know this is past karma? In former times in the reign of Emperor Zhangzong there was a prince consort, chief judge of the Zhangde Prefecture, of cruel nature, whose heart was displeased; without cause he beat his servants. One day an itch arose on his buttocks; scratching removed the skin, gradually the flesh split as if freshly flogged, the pain intolerable, resulting in death. Hence it is known that debts of pus and blood will surely be repaid. Not only this but also all small and great anger, slander, beating and scolding, quarrelling, mutual hatred, all are old grudges formed before, to be repaid in this life. One must joyfully accept and not argue. Bearing and enduring is repayment; if contending, it is like refusing to pay debts, deepening the accumulation, grudge on grudge, with no end. Moreover, the will of heaven delights in repayment; even human questions of favors and grievances are all debts. Recently, when the Perfected of Changchun first dwelt in the North, a general returned north; by chance he met a hereditary thousand-household of Shandong, whose wife was captured. Because the family had long served the Way, they wished to ransom her and make her a nun to consult the Perfected. The Perfected severely refused; before the matter was discussed, the general had already left northward. The inquirer asked the meaning of refusal. The Perfected said: “This person has a three-year debt with his master; now they meet, it is fitting to repay. After three years, the wife became a nun and came to visit the palace of Changchun, paying respects to the Perfected. Because of former good service she received this repayment; the disciples then believed and bowed in thanks.”’

The Master once, when a Daoist was ill, spoke generally: ‘Cultivators regulate their food and drink, have regular movement and rest, their heart and spirit are at peace, no false actions; when illness comes, it is the decree of heaven, how dare they not accept it? It is also the working out of one’s own fate; or due to past affinities this illness or demon arises. First one must see through the four elements; each is false; when ill, teach it to be ill; when death comes, teach it to die. The mind is calm and enduring; follow the changes but the heart is not in the illness; severe illness is light; mild illness heals itself. The original nature is peaceful and harmonious, the turbid and evil qi dissipates; this is also repaying illness debts, passing through a critical juncture. If one does not understand this, the heart will not be at peace. When illness arises the heart becomes frantic; voices call without ceasing; crying pain and ache, blaming heaven and hating earth; blaming others who do not support, hating those who do not seek doctors; chiding others who do not harmonize; blaming those who do not inquire; always arising is ignorance and darkness; karma and heart come to light; nothing is so. Not knowing that one’s own life and death is already decreed, even if greatly alarmed, it cannot be avoided. The extreme disorder of the heart is not peaceful; not knowing the heart is the master of the body, when the master is not tranquil, the whole body is in disorder. Have you not heard the ancients say: “A reckless and confused heart is the gate of hell”? Extra mistakes are invited; in such a condition mild illness becomes severe, severe illness brings death; for it disturbs and confuses the nature. If all things are excessive, becoming illness, the illness is self-made; self-made and self-borne, who else to blame? Those who cultivate the heart will not be so; each should consider this carefully.’

The Master once, when someone was extremely ill and could not leave, spoke generally: ‘Cultivators must first see through the myriad green illusions; next see through this heap of dust called the body; ordinarily free yourself from affairs, and at the moment of departure you will be at ease. Formerly in Shandong there was an abbot who at death lingered, unable to depart. People asked the Perfected of Changchun. The Perfected said: “In past times he was attached to external objects and circumstances, never having refined himself; because of this attachment he is unable to be freed.” Then he sent a message: “The body is not mine; nature is originally void; if one thought does not arise, the whole body is let go.” The abbot heard this and his heart seemed to awaken; he then instructed his brothers: “Because I was attached to external illusions and my heart was untrained, I cannot break free at the moment of death; now I urge you each to make effort and cultivate body and heart, to save this great matter of life and death.” Having spoken, he passed away. Another Daoist, at death undecided, asked the assembly: “How shall I depart?” Some said: “Think of the True Master.” He thought for many days but could not leave. Others said: “Think of the void.” He again could not leave. An old immortal came and saw him; the man raised his hand as before, but now could not depart. The old immortal scolded: “When you came you had something; after departure you think of something; how can you wait for death? When the time comes, you will go.” The sick man heard this, bowed in thanks and passed away. Generally cultivators, in all external matters, presently make use of power; their original truth should be made real. When affairs and things are passed through and abandoned, how can one not be free at the moment of departure? If attached to things and affairs, how can one be free at the moment of departure? Hurry to cultivate, life and death are hard to avoid; the day will come, and external illusions will not help. Each should consider this.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators must have resolve and integrity; but when they have resolve and integrity they become stubborn and fixed. When fixed, matters and things do not transform freely; when they do transform freely, they become lax and idle. Because of this there are many learners like cow’s hair, and the enlightened few like unicorn horns. Some have resolve but do not know the truth; some know but cannot act rightly; though acting long, they do not find the bottom. Generally, those who study the Way must first return to the ancestral root; next must have resolve and integrity; must understand transformation; must be single-minded and diligent; long without ceasing, none fail to attain.’

Someone asked, ‘What is the Way of true constancy?’ He answered, ‘Put aside true constancy; look at yourself in the six or twelve hours of the day; see what you are before thought arises. When thought arises, see whether it is evil or good. Evil thoughts should be extinguished; good thoughts should be used. What are evil thoughts? When there is no matter, all prior thoughts are false and evil. What are good thoughts? When there is a matter before you, responding and benefiting others, revering superiors and comforting the people, all kinds of good thoughts not for self are good thoughts. When quiet the essence is peaceful; when active the use is correct; neither indulgent nor restrained; no day or night; not dark by the slightest; constant response and constant stillness; calm and steady; this is the Way of true constancy.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators have a stubborn heart; since beginningless time they have passed through transmigration and rebirth, like piles of mountains, lives and deaths countless. Until today they repent their past faults and seek liberation. Therefore they dare not eat by day nor sleep by night, refining this stubborn heart, trying to reverse all the world’s reversals so as to apply them; they do not refine the heart and see others do not sleep. Doing thus, their thoughts are like hairs; when touched they kindle lustful fires; even not sleeping a hundred years, what does it avail? The stubborn heart is not ended, and transmigration continues. If you want to change this heart, day and night, every moment, whether moving or still, you must break and shatter this stubborn heart; then you may use it. The original true spirit is like heaven and earth; then it is still. This is the Way; it moves, it opens the mouth; it closes the mouth; what else is there to seek? This is the Daoist who has cast off wine.’

The Master often said: ‘Cultivators must exert effort to cut off the biased thoughts and burdens that have accumulated on the heart since the beginning, and to let go of what is hard to let go, even to the limits of the body; if to let go then let go. Still more, the heart itself is but a void and falsehood; when each is removed, there are no vexations or obstacles. If all external matters and things are unworthy of concern, passing to and fro like mosquitoes and gnats, to brush them away is refreshing. But if difficult things on the heart cannot be removed, that is the seed of transmigration. Formerly the Perfected of Changchun at Panxi often had tigers and leopards prowling about at night; this night they came and went. Some were frightened and at dawn wished to build a fence. They then thought: in such a situation, having such fear and wishing for protection, can life and death be avoided? They let it go, being indifferent to life and death, and the fear disappeared; so that amidst life and death they were firm and unmoved, and all bonds were broken at once. This is the difficult upon difficult path.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators who exhaust the great matter of life and death must seek their own lower work with effort, without distinction of day or night, with one heart clear and bright, the six roots pure and quiet; when meeting sounds and colours, see as not seen; hear as not heard; within the heart not receptive. The disturbances of others are not one’s business; like the wind now passing by. If it concerns oneself, respond as you must. Practising thus, long you will see effect.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators only see others’ good deeds and imitate them; they cannot see others’ faults or they lose themselves; nor should they judge each other’s rights and wrongs. But if you keep to rights and wrongs, the heart is not upright; long progress is impossible. Right can conceal wrong; wrong constantly slanders right. Whoever has an ego and always slanders others is not enlightened but follows an external and evil school. If one has right knowledge and right vision, one must first examine one’s own heart for bias and error, seeking faults; if you interfere with others’ faults, you are not a right person.’

Someone asked, ‘What is merit and practice?’ He answered, ‘Closing the mouth is merit; opening the mouth is practice. What is closing the mouth as merit? Being silent and attaining it without thought or care; sealed lips, forgetting speech; not seeking others’ knowledge; concealing brightness and hiding traces; this is closing the mouth as merit. What is opening the mouth as practice? Applying expedients, teaching others to act rightly, benefiting grasses and plants, guiding the true Way; this is opening the mouth as practice.’

Someone asked, ‘Seeing, hearing, eating, breathing; handling, stepping, thinking; is this nature?’ He answered, ‘The nature of the Way is not this nor apart from this. Movement and stillness, speech and silence are the use of nature, not the essence of nature. The essence of nature is neither moving nor still, neither speaking nor silent. The ancients said: “To know the great Way is to know the ancestors; it is not apart from movement, stillness, speech and silence.” If you identify movement, stillness, speech and silence as nature, you make the slave the master; the master controls the slave, but the slave is not the master. All raising hands, moving feet, speaking, seeing and hearing, myriad forms and appearances, even long stillness, are all servants, not masters. The master is in the hall; it cannot be shown openly; but if he uses servants, he takes upon himself the role of master.’

Someone asked, ‘If one cultivates for three years, can one escape transmigration?’ He answered, ‘Cultivators must set a firm resolve, every moment diligently refining the heart, not presuming on the future, how dare they hold a victorious mind and expect to transcend? Formerly a Daoist newly leaving home boasted: “I see transmigration is small; with some effort I will be free.” Having resolve and exertion, he was struck by sudden illness, and for many years did not recover, gradually losing resolve. Can this be done with a victorious mind?’

Someone asked, ‘If one walks and sits alone in the mountains, seeing mountain spirits reporting future matters, is this true?’ He answered, ‘The ordinary man’s heart depends on myriad dusts, obscure and unclear. The beginner leaving home refines the dust heart; by chance attaining stillness, suddenly seeing the tranquil realm, other images arise, spirits and demons, thinking these are the heart ground, rejoicing and dancing without ceasing. Some see the future; some hear forecasts of events in the air; some see past masters and perfected immortals come and entrust matters of the heart ground. If the heart accepts this, it is attachment to evil; if not removed, it breeds a disease of the heart, no remedy possible. Have you not heard the ancients say: seeing, hearing and awareness are also illnesses? Moreover, what is seen and heard and thought belong to sound and colour realms. Have you not heard the scripture say: “It cannot be seen by looking; it cannot be heard by listening; it cannot be reached by speech; it cannot be attained by thought.” Now when sound and colour are taken as true, this is falling into the evil Way. Formerly a Daoist in sitting meditation sometimes sensed the taste of wine in the mouth, dreamed that someone brought wine, and the next day someone indeed brought wine. This is the spirit’s response to emptiness, not strange; to accept it is attachment to evil. Another Daoist suddenly went out of body and roamed hundreds of paces and then returned, finding his original form seated as ever; several times thus. This is not strange, being like ordinary thoughts going out; only they seek clarity. To think this is cultivation is to be attached to evil. As the vulgar say: “Ten thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; equality and peace accord with the Way.”’

The Master, when the assembly discussed opening the store of wisdom, words gushed forth, said: ‘Cultivators at first separate from the realms; like a mirror suddenly bright; the store of wisdom suddenly opens; all thoughts become clear and orderly; do not dwell on them. If the mind’s seal is fixed, unfeeling but acting, it becomes wild cleverness; then there is no merit; only spirit’s use, not the essence of the Way. Do not run about thinking this is skill; but to conserve is merit.’

The Master, when people discussed dwelling on the mountain, said: ‘Cultivators, when matters come, must see through them; when circumstances come, must respond and pass through. Having passed through once, it is like passing through once more. Formerly a Daoist dwelt on a mountain, in straw clothes and wood food, vowing not to descend, thinking to cut off all burdens of dust and worldliness. One day suddenly two men, each holding weapons, came seeking food and drink. The Master quickly cooked mountain fruit to wait on them. Before it was softened, one man took the fruit from the pot and tasted it, angrily saying: “If you give such things to men, you intend to smash the pot!” The Master did not speak at first; seeing the two men angry and their harsh words, he secretly planned, and on that pretext went outside, found his hidden cudgel, and called loudly: “You two come out; you cannot approach me.” The two men went out the door laughing, saying: “The Master dwells on the mountain and has grown such an arrogant heart; better to descend and be a commoner.” The two then left and suddenly disappeared. The Master then suspected they were sages testing him, and regretted it. This is failing the test of the realm.’

The Master, when the assembly discussed immovability of heart, said: ‘Formerly in Shandong a Daoist came to his master and said: “I have exhausted the fire of ignorance.” The master said: “When the fire of ignorance is exhausted, the heart does not move; that is a good man.” Another day, the master secretly sent someone to test him. At dusk the man came to the door; the monastery door was closed; he loudly struck the door with a rod. The Master answered within; the sound was not smooth; he reluctantly opened the door. The man’s manner was violent; the Master’s countenance changed. When they reached the hall, the man did not remove his shoes, jumped on the seat, showing no courtesy. The Master was greatly angered and reprimanded him. The man clasped hands and laughed: “I did not dare so; the master ordered me to test if you have an unmoving heart; now I have seen it without trying further.” The man was ashamed and speechless. Generally, though cultivators have some skill, how dare they boast? When unaware, they are tested and the true time comes; disheartened and wasted, they have no arrogance. When they boast, they are tested and fail. Even reaching the unmoving state, there are yet matters beyond.’

The Master, when people discussed dwelling in completeness and guarding stillness, said: ‘Formerly a Daoist sat in completeness many years. One day the assembly invited him out; he moved as he pleased. Old friends saw him and asked: “Brother, you obtained this in stillness; can it be used in bustle? Have you truly attained the perfect unmoving state?” The man arrogantly was silent a long time. The friend advanced and said: “I have a touchstone for testing gold and silver; brother try now your heart obtained in stillness over these years; how is it?” He said: “What is there to say about stillness?” The friend said: “It is as a tired ox that carries its burden; return the debts of speech.” The man was angry and cursed, and the friend laughed and said: “This is what you obtained in completeness; the test is true.” The man then bore resentment and broke friendship for life. This man has never refined his heart on the realm; though sitting still for a hundred years, he has no success. He is like a horse tied by a rope; when released it runs as before.’

The Master often said: ‘Cultivators refine the heart as a great craftsman shapes wood; first correct the heart and ink; then at the extreme parts of bias and error gradually add axe and hatchet to shape it rightly and make it useful. Do not move or attach the heart and ink; if the heart and ink are lost, there is no model to follow. When bias and error are all cut away, and the heart and ink are proper, then in accord with others, all tools can be completed.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators often have no affairs on the heart; upright and proper every day and every moment, investigating their original fate and primal spirit’s true place, clear and not dark, mingling with the void as one body. Thus they are Daoists’ hearts. After accumulating days and efforts, there will be spiritual efficacy. Seeing all kinds of activities, better to rest and investigate yourself. If always concerned with things, passing days laxly, you are no different from worldly hearts.’

The Master, when the assembly discussed dwelling in the monastery, said: ‘Cultivators living in a monastery must measure their strength and exercise; live simply, lightly and freely passing the days. Do not be like the worldly folk, contending for fame and profit and lose the original heart, forgetting the great matter of nature and life and cause; this is the right principle. If you can refine and polish the heart ground, unwilling to stay or go, suffering should go, then you will have heart peaceful and unmoved, receiving from all directions, benefiting self and others, peaceful mind accumulating practice, merit and practice both complete. If you do not refine the heart, regarding things as self, then all is strange and greedy; habits narrow and small; sins follow the world, ruining your future. The Master urged the assembly to dwell in the monastic community, saying: “The Perfected of Danyang has a saying: ‘To learn the Way dwell in the monastic community; measure and examine carefully; choose the good for friends.’ If you cannot understand the ultimate principle, grasp its leading points. In the monastic community, mutually instruct and guide, outline and uphold; together cultivate the supreme heart ground and great Dharma gate; this is not a small matter. There are those without insight who do not seek friends, do not dwell in the monastic community, nor discuss the heart ground; going south and north, a thousand mountains and ten thousand waters, wasting straw sandals. Just seeking ease and freedom, when touched or struck, they soon leave. And when they want to be fast, they seek a good place to dwell and favourable conditions, not knowing what is their urgent matter, not knowing how to pass the days, only seeking freedom. Little do they know that the great matter of life and death is coming; see how you hesitate. How can you pass the days idly and waste time? When leaving home, what do you seek? Wise men should carefully consider.’

The Master, when labourers were stirred in heart, said: ‘Although external circumstances are false, you cannot fail to respond. Respond without self; the heart’s essence is void; when matters come there is no hindrance. Then the void does not hinder myriad things; myriad things do not hinder the void. Like heaven and earth, myriad phenomena and things act spontaneously, all without hindrance. If the heart holds an ego, matters come and there is response; then there is disturbance, hastiness, collision and hurt; then the heart moves; when the heart moves, peace cannot be attained. Though working hard all day, labour is futile. Among great crowds and in labour, specially guard your heart; do not move easily; constantly seek your own faults; do not meddle in others’ faults; this is merit and practice. When matters reach your head, you must bear them; myriad situations and dusty things, do not follow them; your heart is clear; all things are not discriminated. Passing the days thus, the beginner does not retreat but attains merit.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators who have some skill, will generate some conceit; if they have ten parts skill, they will generate ten parts conceit. Having conceit, there is ego; ego and conceit form a great obstacle; how can one attain the state of emptiness of mind and extinction? You must add great rigour, crush your body and mind beneath myriad things, always rank yourself last. Think: I am far inferior to others; then you can remove the heart that desires to be superior. When the heart is like the vast void, there is no ego; no ego, then you accord with the Way.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators, in stillness, the realms are manifold; all arise from the recognition-spirit’s transformations, appearing because of stillness, drawing the heart master. Have you not heard the ancients say: “All appearances are false; the heart desires to dismiss the recognition; as long as the recognition-spirit remains, it takes shape and form, spirit heads and demon faces, confusing and disturbing the heart master.” If the master does not move, it seems as if not seen; its essence is like the void; there is no place to abide; it naturally fades away; no realm to bewitch; no thing to destroy. Formerly a Daoist, with heart at rest, one day sitting, suddenly saw countless evil demons riding the void; the man calmed his heart; his essence was like the void; obscure and indistinguishable; risking his body, indifferent to life or death; the demons dispersed. Because the master was present and unmoved, how could there be demons? But the heart is not yet exhausted; so these appearances manifest; if the essence-nature is pure and clear, then they will vanish.’

Someone asked, ‘How is the merit of the guardian of completeness?’ He answered, ‘Formerly the Perfected of Changchun in Shandong, going to a temple, behind was one who sat in completeness among those observing fasts. Then someone covered the Perfected, saying the man in completeness wished to speak to the Perfected. The Perfected ordered the fast to end and they met. Unexpectedly, he asked, and the Perfected went out, soon striking the door of the completeness place loudly several times. The man thought him ordinary and angrily answered; the Perfected then returned. After the fast, the assembly again asked to meet; the Perfected said: “He has been tested.” This man’s ego remains; not yet fit to speak to. So he was sent away. Generally, dwelling in stillness is a great matter of nature and life; collecting and arranging is straight and efficient; nurturing is merit; when meeting situations, not moving is proof. Now this knocking is a realm; the responder is the heart. When the heart forgets self, like ash extinguished, though stirred there is no flame; meet the realm unmoved, peacefully pass through; this shows effort on the heart. Now when hearing some empty sound, you soon move the heart; how can all evil realms pass? Though dwelling in completeness, what use is it? Receiving offerings and debts of speech, how can they not be repaid? It is better to apply effort on realms of movement and things; on matters, single-mindedly refine the heart; that is a person with insight.’

Someone asked, ‘Cultivators say knowledge and awareness are sickness; what is the meaning?’ He answered, ‘True knowledge is the knowledge of not knowing; true awareness is the awareness of no awareness. The original true spirit, after obscure kalpas, now awakens; this is called awareness; all knowledge and views arise from this. If one says there is knowledge and awareness, yet desires constant knowledge and awareness, this is binding and entangling oneself, a sickness without cause. If one is always unaware and unknowing, yet penetrates into another shell, having awakened to original knowledge and awareness, all is useful; use it when needed; do not make it constant.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators when the dusted heart rests and worldly worries vanish, alone manifesting their original true root, this is the innate master. Taking responsibility, roaming free, all Dharma realms become clear at once. When reaching this place, one must conceal brightness and hide traces; protecting and nurturing more; more merit, more effort. When displaying and proclaiming with intention, one unknowingly diminishes the brightness.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators have sharp and dull natures. Those dull in nature must not be stubborn; best to dwell in monastic communities, humble the heart, make affinity with those who understand principles and clarify the heart; when affinity is ripe, they naturally lead into the Way and gradually awaken. If your nature is dull and sluggish, with no insight, daily associating with like kind, mixing with worldly dust, when dust and conditions mature, you will surely fall back from the Way. Or encountering demonic realms, seeing hellish visions, no one to rescue, sinking deeply; how grievous!’

The Master said: ‘Formerly one in completeness heard others speak of the ground; having entered completeness, he wished to see the ground. The mind held this thought; with each thought it appeared; not knowing it was false. What is heard belongs to sound; what is seen belongs to colour; what is thought belongs to illusion. Then he saw golden boys and jade girls, true immortals and sages manifest; seen clearly in broad daylight; this too is a false realm. Illusory thoughts made him believe this ground was real, so he was held and could not break it; confused for a lifetime, attached to evils and demons. Little knowing the ground is the ancient man’s heart reached to a steady and resting place, hence the name. Like one’s dwelling place, clearing thorns and rubbish, the ground is even and suitable for residence; this is called the ground. Cultivators, when the heart ground is steady, affairs do not move it; this is the unmoving ground. The myriad dusts cannot stain it; this is the pure ground. Revealing one’s eternal Dharma body, clear and bright in every part, bearing all; this is the perfect and bright ground. Speaking of ground, there is also a boundary and place of going; when reaching no position, no place, beyond name and word, this is called profound beyond the profound. How can it be taken as real by seeing, hearing and thinking?’

The Master said: ‘Non-action is the Way of Heaven; action is the Way of man. Non-action accords with Heaven; action accords with man. Like a man carrying a burden, when both ends are held the load stands firm; if one end is let go it tilts; if both ends are let go, even the burden disappears, returning to the original place.’

The Master said: ‘Formerly under the East Hall when rain fell, persons in charge called on all to move the damaged things, regardless of age. All competed to respond; only an old immortal sat quietly and did not come out. When the matter was done, the assembly sat around; one said to the Perfected of Changchun: “How many are truly broken?” The Perfected scolded: “How many people truly refine their heart to the place of rest? Like a precious pearl, no part for them. Consider each person’s heart ground and affairs. Generally, in the teaching school, those who attain are prized.”’

The Master said: ‘Formerly in the kitchen under the Perfected of Changchun there was a cook; all approved his gentleness and humility, never seeing his heart move. The Perfected knew and secretly sent one to test him. In the morning things in the kitchen were moved elsewhere; the man made porridge, soaked rice and stirred the pot; he sought a ladle and spoon but could not find them; so it overflowed; he greatly moved in heart. The Perfected saw and said: “Even if it all overflows, these are external things; why spoil the heart?” The man then awakened and respectfully thanked.’

Someone who was a doctor asked, ‘I practise medicine and have revived more than a hundred dead; what is the result?’ He answered, ‘Even if all under heaven were saved, it is not equal to saving one’s own life and death. Worldly questions of blessings and retribution have limits; when one cultivates to the place where there is no birth and death, the blessings are unlimited.’

Someone who was a craftsman asked, ‘I built a great hall without charging wages; with such sincerity, what result is there?’ He answered, ‘Not equal to a pure person sitting in silence for one hour. For the blessings that arise from action have failure; the blessings from non-action have no failure.’

The Master often showed the assembly: ‘Men born into the world, all actions have retribution. Those who attain the Way receive the Way; those who do good receive blessings; those who do evil receive evil. Those who love others are loved; those who hate others are hated; those who respect others are respected; those who scorn others are scorned; those who are humble are humbled; those who are truthful are trusted; those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed; those who exalt themselves are suppressed; those who desire precedence are contended with; those who act strongly have enemies. Therefore it is said: “Plant orchids and get fragrance; plant millet and get grain.” All is the principle of retribution. If one holds a mind of profit, cunning and deceit to gain others’ hearts, then truth is lost.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators must avoid speaking of others’ merits and faults, or of others’ rise and fall. All worldly affairs not concerning oneself should not be spoken of with the mouth nor thought of in the heart. Speaking of rights and wrongs is losing oneself. If one only refines one’s own heart and constantly seeks one’s own faults, how can there be effort to mind others’ houses? Whoever acts for others should have good points; it is proper to imitate them; when entering evil places, one should turn back; do not mind further; gradually reach rest and cessation.’

The Master said: ‘The assembly said: If cultivators leave the village, then they complete the Way; if they cease meat and wine, then they ascend; if they cease attachment to family, then they are immortals. Cease attachment to love of others; cease love of others being not so. Only self remains; all is unrecognised; dozing is the Way; do not sleep. Not good companions should cease meeting; words without benefit should cease speaking. When matters succeed, do not rejoice; when matters fail, do not grieve. Learn from those better than you; teach those worse. Others’ loss is blessing to you; your loss is misfortune. Words exceeding deeds are false; deeds exceeding words are real. Desire and passion are human affairs; dustless heart is the Way of immortals. Those willing to be low are high; those willing to be poor are rich. Return to constancy and accord with the Way; follow reason and accord with man. The correct Way must be followed; the evil path must not be entered. The Way is clear and bright; essence and use are perfect. This is called Complete Truth.’

The Master said: ‘The ancients who studied the Way, if the heart was not yet open, did not travel a thousand li to seek a master and ask questions. If the minds were not suited, and the heart ground not clear, with no doubts left, then perhaps they dwelt in gardens or walled places, or resided in forests and springs, or begged in the market, or established temples, with peaceful heart guarding the Way, no changes or corruption; these cultivated the highest. Some who left home had unclear nature, were lazy in questioning, were proud and competitive, self-righteous, feigned lofty Way, lost merit and practice, and both were empty. They startled those who supported them, not thinking how their virtue was consumed. Such people should neither dwell in gardens nor beg; when life and death come, they are useless. They do not wish to exert effort on root and trunk; even for a hundred years, no good results.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators tidy their hearts like a carved wooden sacred image sitting in the hall. Though for a whole day no one is present, so it is; surrounded by attendants and servants, so it is; with incense and flower offerings, so it is; with coming and going, with slanders, so it is. Only the wooden image is spiritually alive and sacred, lively and bright, clear in the Way and virtue; it does not abide in all things and matters.’

The Master said: ‘The Daoist refines the heart like casting gold into the form of a chicken; though the form and colour are the same as a chicken, the heart is always unmoved, alone standing apart from the chicken flock. Though chickens love to fight, none dare approach it. Those who embody the Way have hearts like cold ashes and forms like withered wood; though men like to contend, they cannot compete. Therefore the scripture says: “Only because he does not contend can no one contend with him.”’

The Master said: ‘This which has essence and use, without ego, upright and proper true heart, has been received since antiquity before heaven and earth existed; it cannot be said to exist or not exist. The ancients and sages and old Daoists all have it and use it. Thousands of scriptures and tens of thousands of treatises, even a great store of scriptures, only speak of these matters. Heaven too depends on this; earth too depends on this; indeed heaven and earth, myriad things, limitless void, are ruled by this master of movement and stillness. To attain this without being led away by all realms, without being entangled by all thoughts, not deceived by the six roots, this is the daily use of immortals, the conduct of sages, the Way of the future Daoists.’

The Master said: ‘Those who dwell in the monastic community gather like clouds; how can everyone be equal, each on the same level? It is like a great mountain, with complete grasses and trees; some are unfit; some are fit; some stand alone; some depend on others; there are spiritual shoots and auspicious grasses; there are wild thorns and brambles. All kinds are different; according to nature and spontaneity, there is order. The mountain is majestic, without selection, embracing each and all. Flowing water, piled stones, thick forests, abundant grasses, beasts running, birds calling, all are spiritual manifestations of marvelous use. Each supports the other; like cockleburs on hemp, standing upright without support; enduring as heaven and earth, each attains accomplishment. If you wish to cut long and extend short, to change green into yellow, how can they have no peace? You will lose their nature.’

The Master said: ‘Formerly when dwelling in charge in Shandong, he shut the door all day and received no affairs; more than ten years, making stillness the heart, but had no merit or practice. Sitting alone where no one touched him, meeting no realm, no things; how can such a heart be judged good or bad? This is just wasting time. If heaven does not favour things, the four seasons do not proceed; if earth does not favour things, myriad things do not grow. If you cannot benefit yourself and others, what merit is there? Therefore the Perfected of Changchun said: “Movement benefits men and things; this accords with the Way of heaven and earth.”’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators, if the mysterious gate is not open, the heart ground is not clear, busy with karma and consciousness, unable to be without action, it is because they have no blessings and merit. They should exert themselves in action, in the teaching school according to their portion, establish merit and affairs, receive and await others, humble the heart, revere teachers and friends, constantly use expedients, weed out selfish and evil, gradually mature in affinity, day by day advance, naturally penetrating. They cannot bear a load with no ends; cannot be without action; cannot have action; passing the days idly, without merit or practice. When steady, place the foot; when sweet, place the mouth; idle with worldly affairs; at the border show up; indulge body and mind; not fearing spirits and deities; counting days. Have you not heard the Perfected of Changchun say: “The heart below the work completely abandons worldly affairs; the teaching school exerts great effort to raise dust and toil.” If there is no heart ground work, and the teaching school does not exert effort, passing the days idly, please consider who this is.’

The Master said: ‘Fate and cause are fixed, not by human power. One must follow nature and await the decree; inner work and outer conduct depend entirely on one’s own heart. One who can exert effort has merit. Whether to act or not, each gains accordingly. When the teaching school is not open, one must conceal oneself, the heart communicating with heaven. When the school opens, outer merit should respond, harmonizing heaven and man. Merit does not tire of increase; practice does not tire of breadth. It depends on the firmness of the heart to attain accomplishment.’

The Master said: ‘The Way is everywhere; every point is so; every colour is true. Only it depends on one’s own timely use; what else is there? Alas, the heart is heavily coated with dust and attachments; the root is not understood; picking leaves and seeking branches, following the waves; few turn the mechanism. Even with deep study, not seeking reality, falsifying and fabricating, seeing gods and ghosts, putting one head on another, turning back and forth; not knowing that the illusory body is limited, that brightness is fleeting, not lasting a breath, what then?’

The Master said: ‘Daily use: the heart is without distraction; the mind does not wander; releasing and yet not loose; controlling and yet not restrained; clear heart and knowing law; discarding knowledge and departing emptiness. In the twelve hours, every moment present. If one is stuck in the present, it is not the principle; if one departs from the present, there is no place. Knowing movement and stillness, knowing coming and going, each moment letting go; no attachments, no hindrance; this is a free and easy person. But if all is said to be false, it must be extinguished.’

The Master said: ‘Heaven and earth are the parents of myriad things. Heaven covers all; earth sustains all. It does not distinguish this as good or that as evil; equally covering and sustaining. Therefore all who are above, this is the heavenly mandate; be like heaven, covering and nurturing and preserving all below; not distinguishing me from you, high from low. All below are also assigned their place by heavenly fate; be like the earth, serving heaven, revering and obeying those above; not daring ever to be negligent. Being between heaven and earth, one must accord with the Way of heaven and earth. Otherwise there will be exceptional misconduct with calamity and punishment.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators’ original root is not lost; in conduct and intention, pass swiftly through matters and realms; do not be entangled in human affairs. Evil and selfish thoughts do not arise; not a speck stands; not a particle clings; bright and clear like the void; not attached to emptiness or being; not clinging to law-signs nor ego views; also embracing others’ brightness; long mutually supporting and interpenetrating; this is the position of sages. Can it be more suspicious?’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators, in conduct and concealment, take their portion; in choosing and discarding, act suitably; humility is the heart; impartiality is the rule; examine the source of movement and stillness; regulate the use of sight and hearing. When myriad conditions are all cut off, with one mind true and constant, endlessly continuing, there is no change or corruption.’

The Master said: ‘Daoists daily use embody heaven’s law and earth’s function; always pure and quiet; clear and not dark; help things and benefit life. Though mixed among myriad dusts and conditions, the true source is calm and silent, without interruption. Naturally obtaining release from the bonds of life and death, this is a great matter and cause. Alas, those who do not awaken, lacking a master, with desires attacking inside and roots and dust enticing outside, cannot be free. The four births arise from this transmigration; the six paths arise from this turning; changing skins, hard to be as today.’

The Master said: ‘Those who follow the Way hold to simplicity and purity, silently and secretly moving; removing passions and desires, gradually preserving and diminishing; impartial with things, acting clearly; bending oneself and following others; cultivating benevolence and accumulating virtue; every slight error must be removed; every subtle merit must be accumulated; right and wrong both vanish; heart and law both forgotten; the mechanism of advancement will naturally be reached.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators, having left home, for this great matter of nature and life, after many years fail to perceive; are moved by things; only learn words and disputes; a hundred kinds of ability, yet only slaves and servants. How do I know this? Whenever relying on skill, it must be shown before men; such is not to be served by men. How can it be the business of pure and unacting masters? Therefore wise men of the Way are not used by the wise; but are used by the foolish. The clever are not used by the clever; but are used by the clumsy. Those who speak cleverly speak; those who are silent listen; consider carefully who is busy and who is idle. Whoever wishes to cultivate must have a clear heart and maintain stupidity and clumsiness; then all the wisdom and craft of the world will be used by him.’

The Master said: ‘The secret teaching I transmit cannot be sought with the mind, nor attained without the mind; to know by not knowing, to get by having nothing. The confused world seeks the Way by wearing colours, seeking by words and speech, seeking by demeanour, seeking by law-signs; none attains the full completeness. Not knowing that there is no general trace, seeking by traces is not the Way. Investigate whence the traces come; know whence they come; then there is something not of sound, not of fabrication, not of demeanour, not of law-signs, within. This cannot be known by knowledge or consciousness. It is only this original portion, complete and true; in accord with heaven and earth; with sages; with ghosts and spirits; with myriad things; such a great matter and cause; how can it be seen by dust, sound, colour and traces? The Perfected of Danyang said: “True joy and true ease know no discussion; most subtle and most wonderful beyond all calculation. When there is no calculation, it is near.”’

The Master said: ‘Those who have left home long to dwell in the monastic community, with morning and evening precepts and polishing, yet still are lax and estranged, drifting and not advancing; the Dao heart gradually declines; worldly affairs increase day by day; roaming wildly; unable to be empty and quiet. How much more for those who walk alone among the world, with dust and passion fading, attachments and entanglements obstructing the Way and cause, all points being so, not self-aware. Even when meeting sages and perfected, they cannot be persuaded or transformed; a hundred entanglements and knots deceive the neighborhood; sinking down and drowning; blessings vanish and karma grows long and deep. If willing to turn back, still can be saved. To accord with dust and oppose the Way, helpless; hell is not far.’

The Master said: ‘Those who study the Way do not tire of questioning; like a man walking on the road, diligent questioning prevents confusion. When one asks about minor skills, without a master one cannot get them. How much more for the great Way, which cannot be seen or heard; when beginners do not meet a master, how can they understand? The greatest suffering is life and death; if not personally arriving, how can it be obtained? Hence it is said: “The ancients who studied the Way were not careless; they served their true master till old age.” If you do not know where to begin, nor approach the enlightened, even with resolve and practice, great errors abound.’

The Master said: ‘Those who study the Way only allow suffering for self and benefit for others, secretly accumulating merit and practice. If they again indulge the mind and act unrighteously, not only do they disgrace the teaching school, they also invite disaster for themselves. Their body and mouth are not pure or frugal; no different from the world. Thus, receiving offerings of the sweat and blood of the ten directions is not beneficial; receiving pleasure, one suffers pain; life and death come to an end, no more excuses. Already belonging to the school, why not refine the heart?’

Someone asked: ‘Those who study the Way do not sleep through the night; what is the meaning?’ He answered: ‘Beginners’ sleeplessness is originally to refine the heart; if they do not gather their heart, what is the use? Those who gamble, play chess, weave, spin, grind, and do not sleep all night, are they all those who have attained the Way? Such people in the twelve hours are driven by profit; only craving wealth; busy and troubled in heart and spirit; like mosquitoes biting the skin; therefore they cannot sleep. Cultivators are not like this; sleep is a desire; if not changed, it fosters evil and falsehood and obscurity and blockage; it belongs to the nether realm. Like a man defending against thieves, sitting upright and waiting; the thieves retreat. They cultivate the heart exclusively, fearing wandering about. This one heart originally has no fixed essence; in the yang it is bright; in the yin it is dark; when ripe the condition disappears; non-action is pure and bright; this is why they do not sleep day and night.’

Someone asked: ‘Those who study the Way willingly endure poverty and cold; what is the principle?’ He answered: ‘If poverty and cold and hunger are merely accepted as is, then all the street poor and difficult people are immortals. Cultivators take virtue as heart, purity as thought, cutting off deceit, greed and false acting, once sent away, forgetting form and self; things outside the body are never minded. Hence it is said: “Covering the skin and flesh with clothes, choosing better or worse; filling the belly with rice, choosing finer or coarser. Only to save life and death, refining the heart is the matter; therefore they do not mind bodily hardship.”’

Someone asked: ‘Are there still future sins and blessings?’ He answered: ‘Do not speak of the future; according to what is seen, speak. If you generate a good heart, wishing before the saintly master to burn incense and bow, holding the incense in hand, sincerely wishing for your family’s peace and increase of blessings and longevity, this is not a heart doing good; hoping for blessing; even if blessings come, you do not know it. Cultivators of goodness know they cultivate secretly and repay secretly; therefore none know. If you generate an evil thought, hold a knife and kill a man, the moment you raise this thought, you must bear death penalty. This cannot be done in bright and just places; in the dark and unknown you act; soon exposed, you must repay death. This is not hoping to sin to get sin; this sin is clear knowledge. Those who do evil act secretly but repay openly. This concerns present persons, necessarily clear and certain. Moreover, heaven observes; what men do not know, how can you escape? You must beware.’

Someone asked: ‘Heaven and hell have always been spoken of; are they real or not?’ He answered: ‘Heaven is the yang realm, master of good and blessings; hell is the yin realm, master of evil and calamity. The ancients established teachings; heaven and hell arise from the human heart; the heart’s conduct responds accordingly. When pure and still, benefiting all, and all good is practised, clear and not dark, this belongs to the yang realm. All kinds of evil, pits, traps, crooked and uneven, strange and evil paths belong to ignorance and darkness, growing and revolving, filth and dust; all belong to the black register; men and gods do not allow; the heart master is distressed; multitudes suffer torment; no one rescues; this is hell. The ancients said: “A pure and still heart is the road to heaven; a reckless and confused heart is the gate to hell.” It is like a mountain path; one hears of robbers who kill and block the road, often harming travellers. If the heart believes and retreats, there is no harm. If the heart does not believe and blindly proceeds, if there is no robber, it is well; if there is a robber, you fall into the trap; then regret is too late. The teaching of hell is such. Generally, to do evil is worse than to do good; though good may not be rewarded, what sin is there? The evil path is harsh and full of calamities. In this world, if you are clear and have no repentance, how can you know the nether world?’

Someone asked: ‘There is a saying above that all have it complete; why then cultivate?’ He answered: ‘All hearts not yet refined are like ore containing white gold; unrefined, it is stubborn stone. Placed in a great furnace, the dross is refined away and the true substance separated; being gold, it is no longer ore. Cultivators are like this. The mind is like stubborn ore; use resolve and integrity as great cold; use wisdom and illumination as the craftsman; diligently refine, leaving not a trace; refine out your own original unobstructed true heart. Once it becomes true, no longer false; then protect and guard it firmly; naturally receive and use it. This is the eternal perfect and bright precious pearl.’

Someone asked: ‘When reaching the place of pure stillness and non-action, is it complete?’ He answered: ‘Speaking of essence, it seems right and yet wrong. As for the perfect place, it cannot be spoken, cannot be thought, cannot be known by knowledge, cannot be grasped by consciousness; most subtle beyond words, then it accords. Neither movement nor stillness, not apart from movement or stillness; how can it be defined as non-action and purity?’

Someone asked: ‘I once heard the Master of Danyang said that understanding death and completing the Way is swift; what is the meaning?’ He answered: ‘Cultivators should regard this body as a condemned prisoner being led to market, step by step approaching death, with death in mind, severing all matters; though there are sounds and colours, scenes and things surrounding, the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, thought forgets all; this body is also abandoned, how much more other things? Refining the heart with this in mind, one sees swift effect; death brings life; neither birth nor death. Beginners in the Way, saving life and death, should think thus. Life is but a moment; one breath not yet come is death’s place; urgently use the heart, diligently cultivate, send away all the ordinary heart, benefit yourself and others, mutually rescue; do not delay.’

Someone asked: ‘If the heart is not attached, free and unrestrained, is it in accord with the Way?’ He answered: ‘When the mind arises without attachment, this is attachment; having a mind without attachment is also attachment without attachment. Just wishing for stillness and steadiness, you have already fallen into the root of thought; letting things be as they are is also becoming an evil view. Without attachment and without attachment, both are like medicine; medicine for no illness; when illness is gone the medicine remains; in the end it becomes medicine disease. Only when words and thoughts cease does one arrive home; stop asking about the path.’

The Master said: ‘The Way has no words; it only points to good and evil. Good leads to the supreme causes of transcendence; there is heaven but no hell. Evil leads to boundless suffering; there is hell but no heaven. The division of these two paths depends on confusion or awakening. Awakening means becoming saintly in a moment; confusion means sinking for endless kalpas. To have human birth is fortunate; should you not consider it?’

The Master said: ‘All sages walk the same path; only because of clarity or obscurity. If clear, one is saintly; if obscure, one is ordinary. Ordinary people’s hearts are unwilling to cut off passion and attachment, abandon falsehood and remove evil, follow circumstances and change, go with the feelings, seeking momentary pleasure, accumulating kalpas of disaster, neither aware nor mindful, neither awakening nor understanding.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators must first understand their own portion; next must understand the teachings. If the original school is not understood, it is like a man without eyes who cannot distinguish roads; he makes wrong steps. If teachings are not clear, it is like a man who has eyes but sits in darkness; then there is bias and ego views. Both must be understood to respond completely; if neither is understood, it is like sitting in great darkness without eyes; when will one emerge?’

Someone asked: ‘The Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir; what is it?’ He answered: ‘It is the original true nature. Because it is swift, sharp, strong and bright, changing and flowing, it is called gold. Having been refined and perfected, it is complete and indestructible through kalpas, hence it is called the elixir. Its essence is like the void; its surface shining and clear; not a speck clings; not a particle is stained; shining brightly, manifesting all without place. Therefore the Ancestor said: “Original true nature is called the Golden Elixir; four falsehoods are the furnace refining it into a pellet; unsoiled and without thought, removing false thoughts, naturally a form emerges to ascend the immortal altar.” People of the world say the Golden Elixir is the place of form and image and passion and desire; this is the vision of hell and the work of lust and evil; it is contrary to the Way of men and enters the lower births.’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators, in all matters not concerning them, in all dusts not staining them, in all places where they accord with heaven and earth, if here they investigate essence thoroughly, then the original heaven cannot resist; the later heaven will obey heaven’s times. Heaven itself cannot resist; how much more man, how much more ghosts and spirits?’

Someone asked: ‘What is the mysterious and subtle?’ He answered: ‘Who taught you to ask this?’ The man clasped hands and said: ‘I put forth my own intention.’ He answered: ‘Then you yourself will know.’ The man laughed and bowed. Someone asked: ‘What of the past not pursued, the future not anticipated, what of now?’ He answered: ‘Extinguish movement but not illumination; more must be understood who extinguishes movement. When understood the authority is in your hand; whether to extinguish or not extinguish depends on you.’

Someone asked: ‘If not asking about future or past mind, what then is the now mind?’ The Master looked straight and said: ‘This is not now.’ Then bowed his head and said: ‘This is not now.’ Then asked: ‘Have you understood?’ The man laughed and said: ‘Not yet.’ The Master said: ‘With eyes wide open, if you cannot even grasp now, what need is there to speak of past and future?’

Someone asked: ‘What is calamity and blessing?’ He answered: ‘Piling wood forms a forest; piling stones forms a mountain; piling water forms a sea; piling good deeds forms blessings; piling evil deeds forms calamity. The source of calamity and blessing comes from the one heart; when piled up it is formed; how can it not be guarded?’

Someone asked: ‘What is good and evil?’ He answered: ‘Every good heart is good; every discontented heart is evil. Men do not know that good is greatest good; men do not know that evil is greatest evil. Good and evil, when not thought of, something else is above.’

Someone asked: ‘Both Daoists and ordinary men have sickness; what then is difference?’ He answered: ‘Formerly the Master of Danyang was ill; doctors could not diagnose his pulse. The hermit Huqiu sat calmly, yet physiognomists could not see his truth; why so? Because the heart is not in things, nature cannot be changed; essence is not apart from the root, ghosts and spirits cannot measure. How much more for doctors and diviners, the common?’

The Master said: ‘Cultivators’ correct eyes do not open; the perfect mechanism does not arise; they seek only others’ traces and words, judging phrases, never finding truth. Like the blind who, though hearing of the sun and moon’s light, never see themselves. Because they have not diligently cultivated their own heart.’

Someone asked: ‘In movement and stillness and realms, what then is?’ He answered: ‘When the heart is pure and still, though in a crowded, noisy market, among the bustle and confusion, not concerning oneself, others’ disturbances are like in a quiet room with nothing. If in a complete quiet room, in a place with no people, it is as if at a crossroads, facing saints and sages, not daring to arise the slightest false thought. Thus, in movement realms there is no hindrance; in stillness realms there is no hindrance. There are yet more confusing things.’

Someone asked: ‘Having said to harmonize brightness with dust, yet say not to touch affairs, how so?’ He answered: ‘Heaven is heaven; earth is earth; mountain is mountain; water is water; thing is thing; I am I; though mixed together, how can they be attached?’

Someone asked: ‘Myriad forms and shapes, all different; how can one body and one view be had?’ He answered: ‘Heaven is the Way; earth is the Way; all things are the Way. That is also the Way; this is also the Way. Though forms differ, the Way is everywhere; how can they be different?’

Someone asked: ‘All men seek pleasure; Daoists embrace hardship; why?’ He answered: ‘Men of the world do not know true pleasure; they take the heart’s acceptance as pleasure; being led by desire, they are in hardship, and mistake hardship for pleasure. Every day they weigh and measure, seeking worldly pleasure; if not attained, they are anxious and troubled in heart and spirit, never free; this is great hardship. Those who study the Way do not seek such pleasure; the heart abides in the Way; meeting hardship without hardship; having no hardship, always pleasure; heart free and at ease. Where there is pleasure, there is hardship; where no pleasure, no hardship; heart without pleasure or hardship is true pleasure.’

Someone asked: ‘How can one arise from the cause and effect of sin and blessing?’ He answered: ‘Sin and blessing and cause and effect belong to the shell of yin and yang. If you can escape the shell of yin and yang, then naturally there is no sin, blessing or cause and effect. What is the shell of yin and yang? Whenever on the heart a trace of selfish, evil, profit-seeking, or harmful thought arises, it belongs to the yin shell; whenever there is a trace of good thought, it belongs to the yang shell. In yin there is evil retribution; in yang there is good retribution. If you have refined the heart essence to be like the void, neither good nor evil, no trace to cling to or to act as master, then calamity and blessing cannot cling to you, cause and effect cannot bind you; this is the one who has escaped the shell of yin and yang. Those who are at home have not had a good thought in their heart during the twelve hours; only seek wealth and profit, killing and hurting each other; a heart of ignorance and darkness; only falling within the shell of yin and yang. They cannot go to the yang Way; how can they escape the shell of yin and yang? It is hard to have no sin or blessing, no cause or effect. You make them yourself; how can you avoid them? So lower your head and close your eyes; let the Elder Yan handle it.’

Someone asked: ‘What of future rebirths; what is the truth?’ He answered: ‘Life in this world fashions the mold of the next life according to one’s feelings. Good deeds fashion a good mold; evil deeds fashion an evil mold. Until one finishes this retribution body and leaves the shell, like iron melted into gold juice, the maker pours it into the mold made by oneself, whether human or other birth; self-made and self-suffered. The maker does not intend to make you another birth or for the six paths; it is your own life that makes the shell, falling into it with no escape. Having this nature, you become that thing. Like the cruel become snakes, the stingy become dogs, the lustful and murderous become swine, the greedy and violent become wolves; all large groups are such kinds. Heaven and earth have myriad forms and shapes; they cannot be exhausted; all are self-made and self-suffered. Hence the ancients said: “Like gold and stone, change into gold and stone; like water and fire, change into water and fire.” This is true. Losing human birth in a moment, one does not return for kalpas; should one not think on this?’

Someone asked: ‘I am now old and cannot study much; please speak a word of the supreme, most profound and wonderful.’ He answered: ‘Take away your seeking of the supreme, profound and wonderful; that is it.’

Someone asked: ‘In the world there are many teachings; each says its own as right and others as wrong; who then is right or wrong?’ He answered: ‘There are two ends; those who cultivate; those who respond to the world. Those who cultivate the heart like heaven and earth, pure and still, like sun and moon, bright and clear, like the four seasons, moving and transforming, able to respond to affairs, returning the law to its root; no more questioning above; this is the function of the true Way; only cultivators can do it. Those who only recite words and phrases, adorning the law-body, making forms to be seen, making all men joyful; this is the branches and leaves of the teaching school responding to the world; what use is it for cultivation? What use for the true Way? This is temporary expedient use; moreover, the heart contends for men and me, contends for wealth and profit; like common men; how can this be the true teaching? The clear-eyed understand this.’
