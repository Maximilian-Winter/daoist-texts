# Sayings of the Perfected One of Danyang

Collected by Lingyinzi Wang Yi

In the third month of the guimao year of the great stability, I began to pay homage to the Master at the south of Fan Mingshu’s hermitage in Mouping. The Master asked, 'Whence do you come?' I replied, 'From Shuwu, looking up to your virtue, which does not reckon wealth as riches, but is serene and self-satisfied; sitting to enter this Way, I heard of its spirit and rejoiced therein; I desire to serve with humble attire, and to listen with folded hands to one word.' The Master then said with joy, 'It is a loss that the young have a heart to learn the Way, yet it is rarely attained.' After a long pause he said, 'When hungry, then eat; when the meal is done, then sleep.'

One day, the Master saw me standing with hands clasped, and angrily said, 'The Wayfarer needs only to be free and open, and must not preserve his dignity. The hermitage is not a place of scabies, nor are you an official or magistrate. If you still speak of worldly rites, then your intercourse will be in vain. The ancients said: "On the three mountains there are those who cherish human feelings but are dispassionate; throughout the four seas there are none who seek family and righteousness; this is not idly said."'

The Master often whispered, 'He who learns the Way must have self-enlightenment. Those who do not enlighten are caused by confusion and ignorance. To dispel this ignorance, first cleanse the heart, and it lies in being clear, deep, and bright. When the work is accomplished, perfection follows; there is no need to ask others. This is a matter of skill or clumsiness; be tranquil and plainly understand.'

When the Master travelled the Way from Shu to Mou, monks and Daoists, whether acquainted or not, would first pay respect. Those who followed doubted and asked, 'Though we are strangers, why pay respect?' The Master said, 'The Way is founded on softness, weakness, humility and lowliness. Moreover, the three teachings are of one door but different households. Confucius said, "Though I hold the whip, I am also for him." I have never heard that one bow is a fault.'

The Master said, 'The Patriarch was versed in literature, and after understanding the Way was especially quick-witted in giving words; as for concealing meanings, splitting characters, obscure phrases, and linked pearls, he did not even need to plan. Often composing poetry with others, if there were rhymed words, all would finish, but the Patriarch alone would then add two hundred and sixty golden bone-joints. All would admire and believe it to be the speech of immortals. Now who can succeed him? Except perhaps the Duke of Pankeng, who somewhat follows his steps.'

The Master said, 'When the Patriarch once came to Dengzhou, wearing a peaked bamboo hat and carrying a single segment of iron viewing-stick, his appearance was strange and ancient. Begging in the market, the people of Dengzhou did not recognize him. At night returning to the hermitage, he wrote a poem on the wall:  
"Once parted from Zhongnan’s water and bamboo village,  
No brothers, sisters, nor grandchildren at home.  
From thousands of li away I seek my friends,  
To lead them into the gate of eternal life."  
At dawn he brushed off his clothes and departed.  
A few days later the prefect Heshili Miao came to the hermitage, read the poem, and was full of admiration. He then composed in rhyme:  
"Looking back on three years’ parting from the old village,  
All forget the courtyard bamboos and grown children.  
Another time, I shall wave my sleeve and seek you,  
Promising leisure with a single knock at your door."'

The Master said, 'To nourish qi is to have a mild taste; to nurture nature is to avoid anger; to endure disgrace and lowliness is to cultivate virtue and guard oneness; to be clear, pure, and serene at one’s eaves is to nourish the Way. To have no name recorded in books, and not to be tied to power and gain — this is how one sheds the shell of man and becomes a companion of Heaven.'

The Master said, 'Wine is the liquor that disturbs nature; meat is the substance that cuts off life; the best is not to eat them. To offend through wine and meat may be forgiven; but to offend by lust, the crime cannot be pardoned by execution. Why so? Because lust is fiercer than wolves and tigers; it ruins good conduct, impairs good deeds, wastes essence and destroys spirit, even to the falling away of the body. Therefore it is the great sin of the Daoist.'

The Master said, 'There is no greater pleasure than leisure and peace. If a Daoist feels weary in the hermitage, let him make one or two companions, hang a bag at his side, drag a staff, sing and wander; when he comes upon good mountains and waters, let him linger and not covet the journey’s length.'

The Master said to me, 'He who learns the Way must have a beginning and an end; he must not leave halfway and become the laughing-stock of others. How much more so you, a child of letters! Do you not know that for ordinary men establishing themselves requires fixing a certain occupation? How much more so for one of the Way, which is the great matter of a man establishing himself.'

The Master often wrote a large character couplet, and said to his fellow Daoists, 'Quickly overthrow the mountain of self and others,  
Urgently open the cave of dragons and tigers.'  
I asked, 'How is one to know the mountain of self and others? And dare I ask the place of the cave of dragons and tigers?'  
The Master smiled and said, 'The secrets of Heaven I dare not lightly impart; look closely, whether you awaken or not.'

One day the Master called me; after a long while I came. He asked, 'Whither have you been?' I answered, 'I was sleeping at midday, my spirit clear; by the bedside lay a volume of Zhuangzi, and I took it up and read it; therefore I was not here.'  
The Master said, 'The Way requires a heart that accords; if again one is bound by words, when will there be an end? Thus the Way, when realized, clears the confusion of Nanhua but also confounds it.'

The Master at Huating said, 'What is the Way? The Ancestral Black is the root and source; do you not know it issues from the nose? Have you not heard Guangchengzi say:  
"The cinnabar turtle and river chariot stand firm and tall,  
The crane embryo and tortoise breath extend on and on."'

The Master said to the assembly, 'If one studies the Way with single-mindedness, then everyone may become an immortal. It differs from the world’s striving, which has promotion and demotion. Confucians are broad but lack essentials; the Way is simple and easy to practice. But purity and non-action is the highest method.'

The Master lived in a humble dwelling, with only a low table, mat, brush, inkstone, and sheepskin; vacant and without superfluities. In the morning a bowl of porridge was enough; at midday a bowl of millet gruel; beyond this nothing else passed his lips. One day he called me in, bade me sit long, and I asked, 'Does my Master’s Way have achievements?' He said, 'None. Though in songs and poems you often praise dragons and tigers and infant goddesses, these all convey words to you. Therefore the essence of the Way lies only in nourishing the black. Men lose their black in pursuit of fame and profit. One who learns the Way has no other business than to nurture qi. When the heart fluids descend and the kidney qi rises to the spleen, the original qi circulates without dispersing; then the cinnabar is gathered. If the liver and lung, the paths of coming and going, are trained in stillness till long, one will know. If black is not nourished, though one carry Mount Tai or cross the Northern Sea, it is not the Way. These words were spoken ten days before my transformation.'

I, with companions Cao and Liu, stood outside the humble dwelling when the Master suddenly came out and said, 'The Way is only purity and non-action, free and at ease, unstained and unattached. These twelve characters, if you can chew and digest and break down, then you will become a thorough Daoist. Trust the words of the old man; to practice them will certainly be of benefit, and you will not regret your youthful years.'

The Master at the hermitage of Ma Congren in the western suburbs of Huang County sang:  
'Though the day consumes ten thousand taels of gold,  
It is just as well to win clothes and plain food.'  
He said he heard these words last year outside the pass, rejoiced in their reason, and remembered them, though he did not know by whom they were made. Ma Yuanzhi said, 'These words come from Elder Shun’s Weijiang Collection.'

The Master said, 'How wondrous these words!'

The Master said, 'Who is the ancestor of family customs? The Zhong and Lü families transmit it intimately. The ode says:  
"A single point of spirit light shines through the vast void,  
The masters of painting cannot imitate its wondrous hand;  
Do not compare it idly with the bright moon,  
There is a flaw in the green, how can it be like me?"  
These words reveal a little edge of sharpness.'

The Master said, 'The black is hard to control, swift as a galloping horse; only the still can master it. One must abandon outer longings; though there be various glories before the eyes, like exploring mountains and valleys, this is the Daoist’s heart. If one does not reach the place of no heart, one cannot master it. This understanding of the Way esteems the no-heart.'

The Master further said, 'When the heart is settled, passion is forgotten; when the body is empty, the black circulates; when the heart dies, the spirit lives; when yang flourishes, yin disappears. This is the law of nature, which the ignorant do not know; they only think of their descendants and regard those who learn the Way as useless. Why do they not think deeply of this?'

The Master said, 'I was more than forty years old when I met the Master and entered the Way, and so my temples were already grizzled. Inside my belly there was another handful of hair; whence did it come? For more than ten years I longed for Guanzhong, and nourished spirit and black only. It is like a call in an empty valley; when called it answers; it is no other thing but the void within. My friends do not believe; if one sits quietly and nurtures it, one will know for oneself.'

The Master said, 'The Sea Toad Duke was originally a minister of the State of Yan. One day he suddenly realized the Way, and severed all family ties. His poem says:  
"Throwing off the burning house of three thousand mouths,  
Rejecting the door guards of a million families."  
Later he begged for his own support, and made sport of the market, even going to houses of courtesans bearing wine and combs, without shame. Later, a certain class of Way-learners say, "I come from wealth and honour, but you cannot compare with Sea Toad Duke."'

The Master said, 'The Way of purity and stillness, if one can distinguish it, is perfect goodness and beauty. Hence the scripture says: "If a man can be always pure and still, heaven and earth all return to him." The heaven and earth here are not those external heaven and earth which cover and support, but the heaven and earth within the body. Above the diaphragm is heaven; below the diaphragm is earth. When heavenly qi descends and the earth’s pulse connects, harmonizing above and below, essence qi is naturally secure. This is what the Little Celestial speaks of.'

The Master said, 'To guard the qi, the marvel lies in preserving the essence, especially to be careful in sleep. When about to sleep, bring true thought to the fore, all worries vanish, draw in the body’s sides, breathe softly through the nose, the soul does not wander inward, the spirit does not roam outward; thus the black essence settles. The Master said, "Confucians say repay virtue with virtue, and avenge wrong with uprightness. Former Perfected Ones said bind friends by trust and repay nobles by grace. This may be called the highest."'

The Master at Laizhou had a certain Jiang Xi, who brought the Lü Gong Biography to the Master. The Master read to the part that said all men only seek fame and profit, not knowing the body has spirit; they pursue things and do not return, losing all naturalness. Who can blame them? The Master closed the book and said to Xi, 'These words truly strike the mark. Yet the world has no awakened ones; how hard it is to follow the Way!'

There was Han Tao, styled Qingfu, who admired Tao Yuanming and Shao Yaofu, and was known as Duke of Anleyuan. The Master returned from Guanyou to Shumu, passed through Jinan, and invited the Master to the garden, where he was offered plain food. After the meal, Tao knelt to the Master and said, 'From childhood I have longed for the Way; now my hair is white; I am lucky to meet you, Master; I wish for one word to illumine my ignorance.' The Master answered, 'The Way is based on no-heart, and its function is to forget words; it takes softness and weakness as its root, purity and stillness as its foundation. If it is to be practiced by men, they must limit food and drink, cease thinking, sit quietly to adjust breath, rest peacefully to nurture black. When the heart does not roam, nature is settled; when the form does not suffer toil, essence is whole; when the spirit is not disturbed, cinnabar forms. Then emotions are extinguished in the void, and spirit calmed in the utmost; one may be said to attain the wonderful Way without stepping out the door. Tao thanked him, saying, "The great Way is primal chaos, beyond contradiction; now having heard these wonderful words, I have found the gate and entered."'

Cao and Lai were originally scholars of Confucian learning, but well versed in the Dao. For many years they were intimate. They often asked leisurely, 'How did the Master practice the Way in Guanyou?' Cao and Lai answered, 'The Master in winter and summer wore a single cloth lazy robe, ate coarse but sufficient food; in severe winter cold and snow there was no fire in the hermitage, and water was used as cold as ice. Yet his spirit and black were harmonious and smooth, without any sign of cold. Thus for ten years, if there had not been the Way black within his belly, he could not have endured.'

The Master said, 'In all matters one must be prepared, and so have no misfortune. Therefore, those who follow the Way must in their youth guard their passions and desires, prepare early, and then Immortals may be hoped for. If with hoary hair and drooping neck and spirit weakened, one then desires to learn the Way, is it not too late?'

The Master said, 'The thirty-six guides of the Way and the twenty-four returning cinnabar are the gradual gates of entering the Way, and may not be taken lightly. The Great Way, if it exhausts itself on furnace and stove and takes its image from turtle and serpent, then it is to create trouble from no trouble, and add falsity to nature. These are all too much to await from men. Therefore the Daoists leave the cinnabar classics and writings; though there are thousands of scriptures and tens of thousands of treatises, they may be summed in one word: purity.'

The Master said, 'Purity is to cleanse the source of the heart; stillness is to rectify the black sea. If the heart’s source is pure, external things cannot disturb it; thus emotions settle and spirit arises. If the black sea is clear, evil desires cannot interfere; thus essence is whole and the belly full. Therefore the heart is clear as still water, and the black is nurtured as a child; when black is elegant, spirit is divine; spirit divine then black transforms; this comes of purity and stillness. If one acts with heart and effort, there is a limit to the method; if one acts without heart or effort, there is no end to the pure void.'

The Master said, 'Non-action is not thinking or pondering. Love, desire, caution, anger, hoarding, benefit, and harm — though these are affairs involving action, they are ever non-action; though involved in matters, they are ever without matters. How much more when one is single-minded with a pure heart, holding true thoughts and nurturing qi, and the spirit floats and roams in the realm of freedom, entering the land of nothingness.'

The Master said, 'Liu Gaoshang dwelt in a humble hut for forty years, with no other business than to empty his heart and fill his belly, abandon glories, forget fame, cast away profit, clear spirit and perfect qi; cinnabar then forms, and Immortality is complete. Then there was praise:  
"Seal its outlet, close its door,  
Once this was said, now seeing this man,  
One can say it is simple and right."'

The Master said, 'No-heart is not like the senselessness of cats and dogs; one must keep the heart in the realm of purity and stillness, and have no evil heart. Therefore common men have no pure heart; Daoists have no heart of dust and filth; this is not to say both have no heart and are like wood, stone, cats, and dogs.'

The Master said, 'Not to be born or to perish, is to see the Tathagata. When one enlightens, one is freed from rebirth. Qiu said, "This is the departure of the yin spirit; when reaching the heavenly court, suddenly two flowers fly, and then the yang spirit emerges." This is the first ground.'

The Master said, 'The great Daoist’s feelings are far; non-action is the wonderful root and foundation. The world’s questions have no love for things, and vexations do not follow.'

The Master said, 'If the practitioner’s work is incomplete and the great limit arrives, the sages do not teach death. If one does not practice, when the great limit comes, no escape is possible.'

The Master said, 'If one thought is not cut off, the whole life is lost.' Gong Daosheng asked, 'How is it when one is always tranquil and silent?' The Master answered, 'In the future, whether tranquil or silent, both need not be.'

Yu Qingfeng asked, 'Though I have practiced for years, my Dao eye is not clear and my heart ground not nimble; why?' The Master said, 'There is no other matter; your practice is not sincere.'

The Master said, 'All men and women since beginningless times have become beings; all kinds of affection, greed, and desire arise; they do not pass beyond the revolving world. All foetus, egg, moisture, and transformation; all kinds of nature and form arise from love and desire; nature arises from love, life arises from desire; all because love and desire cause opposition and submission, engender jealousy and expansion; from this comes the round of rebirth, continuous without end. The Dharma says to rectify its soil, one must cleanse the heart. If the heart is clear and pure, the round of rebirth ceases.'

The Master had a fondness for porridge, ate a bowl at midday, then discoursed on the Way with others, tirelessly instructing juniors. He was by nature a kind and benevolent gentleman. When at Laiyang he composed short verses; after a bowl of porridge he would compose a verse of ten lines; students study this. Those who only eat and sit upright, without making the Way their concern, bring their own blame, as may be seen.

The Master said, 'He who learns the Way need not read many scriptures; this confuses the mind and hinders the Way work. If one reads He Shang Gong's commentary on the Tao Te Ching and Jinlingzi's on the Yinfu Jing, reading them from time to time is no harm, but it is better not to read at all. To cherish and nurture qi in the land of Zilu is the best policy.'

The Master said, 'Those who learn the Way, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, must not for even a moment have the heart absent from the Way. When walking, place the feet on level ground; when standing, fix the mind on the vast void; when sitting, even out the breath at the tip of the nose; when sleeping, hold the pearl beneath the navel. After long adjustment of breath, without interruption, and all day as if a fool, this is the true work, not contrived acts of conduct.'

The Master said, 'When first studying the Way, from this day forward cut off worldly affairs and do not bear them in your heart. If there is a single thread not removed, the Way is not firm. Do not think of past matters, do not contemplate future affairs; just block the present before you, and you are a person of no affairs.'

The Master further said, 'The Daoist does not tire of poverty; poverty is the root of nourishing life. When hungry, eat a bowl of porridge; when sleepy, spread a bundle of grass for bedding; passing the days in slender and meagre fashion is the livelihood of the Daoist. Hence it is known that ordinary men cannot obtain purity and stillness.'

When passing Qing She, some invited the Master to a vegetarian meal. Present were several monks, one of whom vaunted his eloquence and disputed with many words. The Master calmly answered, 'If you except your own body, you know nothing else.' That monk blushed and lost face, unable to reply.

The Master said, 'To be a Daoist, one must be a man of firm character; avoid doubts and indecision. Only think that life and nature are great matters; strive to practice and never turn back; aim for sure success. Those with many affections of children and women, and little aspiration for the distant clouds, are not what we call learners of the Way.'

The Master said, 'The black within the body cannot be dispersed; the spirit within the heart cannot be obscured.' Asked, 'How can qi be kept from dispersing?' The Master said, 'The body is non-action.' Asked, 'How can spirit be kept from being obscured?' The Master said, 'The heart is without matters.' Asked, 'If body and heart are thus, can one dwell in a hermitage?' The Master said, 'If you can manage, then it is good to rest.'

The Master said, 'The heart and nature of the Daoist, matters of dust and world, must not be followed and pursued. If you drag a flowery staff, mock the wind and chant to the moon, be absorbed in cold feelings, what harm is there? But if you roam doors asking alms, pushing and grabbing, that is the daily custom of the Daoist.'

The Master said, 'When you first entered Guanzhong, you begged for one meal and ate one meal; now your cultivation is less, but you choose good places to stay and good food to eat; when you become a Daoist, you will not rest, but must seek to repay debts.'

The Master said, 'When I first came to Guanzhong to beg alms, at a wine shop a drunkard insulted me; later he gave me a punch, and I fled; he caught me and struck again; I had to endure. Have you ever met such demonic obstacles?' The disciples answered, 'No.' The Master said, 'Good; when you meet them, do not dispute.'

The Master said, 'The Patriarch’s Way forbade good clothes and good food; singing and playing music; only that nothing at heart should be attached to any thing.'

The Master said, 'When I was in the world, I weighed meat and drank wine; now I have given it up for more than ten years. If one eats meat and drinks wine, one may also be an immortal, but it is but a matter of fate. If the heart does not cherish the Way, and yet loves wine and greed for strong smells, merely coveting mouth and belly, the sin and retribution are hard to escape; in the end one becomes a lower ghost.'

The Master said, 'The Patriarch led four men, Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma. He watched Ren Fengzi’s good virtue. The Patriarch said, "If you hear it, block your ears; when you see it, still clutch the treasure and dare not let it go." Liu Shishu also said this.'

The Master said, 'Once in a leisure talk in the ring, we spoke of new melons. The Wayfolk heard it and next day made melon buns, entered the ring and ate three, and were punished three days without food.'

The Master said, 'The Patriarch once sent disciples to Ninghai to beg some small money and rice, that he might use it. The disciples said, "What if other brothers go and then do not return to the village?" The Patriarch angrily beat them, ceasing at dawn, beating them countless times. I wanted to retreat, but was stopped by Brother Qiu’s advice; until now I dare not forget.'

The Master said, 'When in the village, the Patriarch ordered disciples to enter Laizhou to beg. After some days hesitation, he dreamed that the Master said, "Tomorrow stretch out your hand, be a good man, go up the street and show your hand." At first the false heart barrier withdrew, hence the Master gave this word.'

The Master said, 'In my home village, when first going up the street, the Patriarch capped my head with a little horn and daubed rouge on my face. I privately thought, "I do not fear meeting children who know me, but fear meeting in-laws." When I thought of Fan Mingshu’s dwelling and wished to rest a little, seeing the elders already there, I thought, "This time I will not be shy."'

A disciple asked, 'The Xu Zhenjun Ascending Biography says: In twelve hundred and forty years hence, there will be eight hundred who ascend to Immortality; how is this?' The Master said, 'The Patriarch once said to teach the vulgar ten thousand; the Prince Immortal also spoke of this.'

The Master said, 'Zhang Wenzi has a very good saying; every word he speaks must take care to nurture the treasure of the body.' The Master laughed, 'He opens his shop to speak, but he is really urging others.'

The Master said, 'A hundred songs are not sung, ten advices are not given; if one comes forth, it is also the Patriarch’s words, and through them things are accomplished.'

The Master said, 'Generally, men are proud of themselves and think they can overcome all; often they refuse to submit to others.'

The Master said, 'On the road I found a donkey’s bridle; the Patriarch beat me until dawn, striking my head and face many times.'

The Master said, 'Men still do not believe; if on Qingfeng’s day there are believers, the Master smiles slightly at them.' Modacheng said, 'The Master’s conduct is such, yet men believe him.' Qingfeng said, 'One believer is one immortal; because of this men do not believe.'

The Master said, 'To deeply conceal white snow is not to be solemn; to widely accumulate yellow sprouts is not greed.' Finishing, he laughed and said, 'How is this good?' He also said, 'In dreams the forge casts a shadowless sword; in the Law one removes the heart of passion.' He further said, 'In the Jade Pool palace the blue phoenix dances; in the viewing garden officials white cranes fly.'

The Master returned to Haishang, where all families strictly held vegetarian fasting, following the Five Assemblies established by the Patriarch. When a boy heard that Master Ma in Deng County had a hundred or so followers, he said to the Master, 'We disciples have bathed and rested quietly, and abstained from meat and wine for seven days; we wish to join the pure assembly and pray for blessings to dissipate past karma.' The Master said, 'Good; you have been pure and upright for seven days, and still say there is blessing. Ma Feng’s disciples each hold purity and uprightness all their lives, cut off desires, abstain from meat and wine; their blessings are indeed many.' The assembly all bowed and said, 'The teaching of purity is truly inconceivable.' From then on the people of the three prefectures, house by house receiving instruction, gradually reached the ten directions; hearing the news and believing, the great teaching was renewed, beginning with the Master.

The Master asked his disciples, 'How many periods in a day?' The disciples replied, 'Six periods in one day.' The Master said, 'How many periods in day and night?' The disciples said, 'Twelve periods in day and night.' The Master said, 'Through the twelve periods, the heavenly Way moves and revolves creation; is there any moment of rest?' The disciples said, 'No rest.' The Master said, 'All who learn the Way must conform to Heaven’s Way; revolve the creation within themselves. Through the twelve periods, be always pure and upright, without stirring a thread of dust or thought; then indeed one is practicing. Day by day and month by month advancing without break, next one becomes an immortal. If one falters in work or loses conduct, how can one be enlightened? I look at you all, not for one period of twelve do you have your heart fixed on the Way; you receive offerings from the ten directions, how can you repay them? Once you close your eyes, you enter again the round of rebirth; when will you emerge? Now I warn you, only by clearing your heart and dismissing desires, being untainted amid myriad greens, and harmonizing the spirit black, will there be the Way. If you follow the course but fall short, and your conduct does not reach completion, it is not my fault. Do you not think of your seven ancestors, who in life committed evil deeds, and in the dark suffer their punishments, hoping their descendants will attain the Way and rescue them to rebirth in heaven? Each should take this to heart, strengthen their resolve, and embrace the Way until death. This is my wish; take heed.' The disciples heard these kind words, were all fearful yet self-assured, and vied to redouble their efforts.

The Master said to the assembly, 'The Way has no form or name; it is the ancestor of spirit black. Original black descends and transforms; spirit and brightness arise naturally; refining spirit and uniting with the Way is true cultivation. The rest of the names and forms are numerous and confused, difficult to serve as standard. I will lay out the main outline for you. The key to this cultivation is not to leave spirit black. Spirit black is nature and life; nature and life are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are infant girl and boy; infant girl and boy are true yin and true yang; true yin and true yang are spirit black. All kinds of names and forms must not be clung to; only the two words spirit black suffice. To nourish black and perfect spirit, one must exclude all ten thousand relations, be clear and upright on surface and inside, and long practice with precision and concentration till spirit condenses and black merges. If one does not leak for three years, the lower cinnabar forms; if six years, the middle cinnabar forms; if nine years, the upper cinnabar forms. This is called the three cinnabars complete; the nine transformations accomplished; marrow condenses and transforms; the blood vessels become true; inner completeness and outer abundance; light and shadow thoroughly clear; silent and unmoving, responding and sensing without end; transforming in myriad ways, sitting, standing, dying; thirty-six thousand spirits leap and roam the world, the three realms receive and escort them. Amid the eight hardships, a thousand disasters and ten thousand poisons cannot destroy. Even the great calamities and changes, floods and four collisions, spirits fill the vast void without hindrance. Therefore heaven sometimes collapses, earth sometimes sinks, mountains sometimes crumble, seas sometimes dry up; all forms end in destruction in the final calamity. Only those who learn the Way, reaching the union of spirit and Way, endure eternally without ruin, and with merit join the Nine Ancestors ascending to the Supreme Clarity.'
