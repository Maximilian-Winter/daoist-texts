## Records of the Hall of Joyful Nurture, Volume Two (Thirty Sections)
### One
Man, at the beginning of learning, must first understand each person's proper boundary. Thus, disaster and blessing, death and life, honour and disgrace, rest and sorrow, right and wrong, success and failure, beauty and ugliness, good and bad, are all appointed by Heaven, and one has no control over them. Only the advancement of virtue and cultivation of accomplishment are matters of my own effort; the cultivation of nature and refinement of life are my learning. I can assert control over these, for virtue and accomplishment are the foundation of myself, and nature and life are my root. They can follow me through life and death, come and go at will, unchanged even after myriads of years. If one does not exhaust oneself, but merely seeks these from Heaven, not only does one go beyond one's duty and take the place of others, with no profit whatsoever, but one will also imprison all one's spirit within. The true countenance of myself, clear and always tranquil, will thereby be swallowed up. If one can perceive this, then all external disturbances and unprovoked troubles depend wholly upon the pearl of intelligence in the eye and the sword of wisdom hidden in the breast. It is not difficult to illuminate and penetrate demons and monsters, and to sever all fetters. But alas! Man cannot hold a thought constantly and enduringly; therefore Confucius said: 'Knowing and attaining it, benevolence cannot preserve it. Though obtained, it must be lost.' From this we see that the most precious thing is to endure long in the way, not to be burdened by the material on the immaterial, only thus can the immaterial illuminate the material, continuous and dense, never twofold nor ceasing, conjoining above and below with Heaven and Earth in virtue, this is the work of benevolent preservation. Nevertheless, though the principle be such, the practice is no easy matter. At the beginning of the work, one may not know it; even if one knows, one may not keep it. It does no harm to concentrate the spirit in the void, to regulate the breath in the calm, so that the breath has a dwelling-place, and the spirit a master; the breath does not move rashly, the spirit does not wander abroad; long abiding the spirit enters into the breath without knowing it, the breath envelops the spirit without perceiving it. Such cultivation over many days, with deeply accumulated功, accords with Heaven’s bearing in silence and without odour; this is the true chaos of my teaching, not falling into the extinction of the side door. I greatly marvel at the Confucians of today, who seek to purify principle and return to it as the ultimate of the great Way, yet are unwilling at the height of their attainment to seek the void and thereby attain the true limit of substance. They cannot avoid the recurring appearances of principle and desire, and in the end cannot attain the great awakening of the Tathagata. Moreover, clutching the view of a well and frog, they heap defamation and slander, intending to overthrow my Way and then cease. Among them are not without sages who forcefully refute these calumnies, but alas the many voices of the Chu cannot overcome the shrill cries of the Qi; only scratching the head and asking Heaven, they are left with no remedy. This is why the great Way is not transmitted, and why the world’s condition grows worse. There are those who stand firm and immovable, who do not retreat before demons, who do not refuse hardship when seeing difficulty, and shoulder this Way alone; their功 is surely great! I am fortunate for such disciples and further encourage them. The one orifice of the mysterious gate is the foremost task for the cultivator. Yet if one does not obtain the true ultimate and limitless, how can the phenomenon of the mysterious female gate appear? If one says one has it, it is also illusion and not reality. The essential point of alchemical refinement lies in the mysterious female gate; this gate is the true yin and true yang mingled as the ultimate principle. But before movement, it is a confused and untraceable state, thus called limitless. From the limitless, suddenly and unexpectedly movement begins; this is the movement of the ultimate, giving birth to yang, at rest giving birth to yin, one movement and one rest mutually root each other. This movement and rest of yin and yang’s vital breath is the beginning of all things’ generation. The great cultivator strikes spirit and breath into one piece; at this movement it is the movement of the ultimate, spirit and breath inseparable; at this rest it is the rest of the ultimate, spirit and breath forming unity by themselves. It is said, ‘Kan and Li join to produce the medicine, Qian and Kun join to form the elixir,’ which are none other than the movement and rest of true yin and true yang, also none other than the perfect consummation of the ultimate. Though called medicine and elixir, they are not two; it is only at the first mingling of yin and yang that the spiritual breath first appears and flourishes; when the elixir is complete with form, it is the gathering of external spiritual yang to augment our own innate primal breath, thus is said ‘to match external medicine with internal medicine.’ When gathered into the cauldron and sealed for warming and nourishing, how can it not be spirit-transcending and limitless? But beware the making of a sage by force of thought, and the making of madness by negligence; one breath not examined may grasp others and be grasped by them, respond to objects and be entangled by them; thus spirit moves breath, breath follows spirit, unity of spirit and breath is again divided into two. When spirit and breath are divided, the heart and will relax, and that spirit born of Heaven and Earth, that virtue given by parents, is almost lost. The ancients said, ‘Breath is faint, morning not lasting till evening,’ this is never not caused by spirit and breath divided into two. I now earnestly admonish: if man’s spirit and breath are not united, he must seek their union. Beware not to hold a single thought, lest you bring danger upon yourself; not to be cautious in one matter, lest you sink into ruin. Desire is the root of illusion; nature and life are innate virtue; rather than greed for the momentary pleasure of desire, why not seek the true nature and life of myriads of years? Moreover, whether obtained or not, it depends on destiny; it is not something equally good or noble which can be controlled by me. Once obtained it is forever obtained, this is the best. I further call out: seek nothing else but a bright mirror suspended in the breast, a treasured sword held in hand, to illuminate and pierce the courage of demons and monsters, to uproot the root of desire, not allowing even one thing to entangle you, and it suffices. This is what the ancients called: ‘When faced with matters and people, always bear in mind the light and scene obtained in the stillness and cherish it.’ It all depends upon the learner arousing the spirit, always settling the true self within the orifice of emptiness and void, not permitting spirit and breath to wander at will. Thus Mencius said that the morning breath is always held and preserved, nourishing straight and harmless, then one is blocked between Heaven and Earth. But alas! Things come in confusion, and one must use heart and strength. Yet one must complete one thing and then another, never allowing outside things to draw the heart, nor guest breath to move the master. Thus using without using, things do not cling to things, the four elements all empty, all conditions extinguished. But this state is not easy to attain. At first it does no harm to let the light of the mind and eyes shine directly on the elixir field; after long time the spirit returns and breath lies low, returning to the ultimate of Heaven. The ancients said: ‘The work of entering meditation lies in stopping thought; if thought does not stop, all is vain.’ One must overcome false thoughts, then true breath arises. Once true breath arises, the primal spirit lives by itself. That which is called heart is the essence of breath; that which is fullness of heart is breath; breath and heart are two yet one. What I now show is truly urgent. The medicine is here, the elixir is here, the accomplishment of immortals is not without this. Is the Way manifold?  
### Two
To begin to take in essence and breath, it is necessary that heart and breath depend on each other, spirit and breath not at variance; true yang and true medicine arise therefrom. When one has reached this in practice, one must also know to take stillness for water, and wisdom for fire; day and night practicing, moving and resting in turn, the mind and nature must be empty and bright, settled and not confused; only then can this primal breath and true yang be freely and fully expressed. If the flower of wisdom blooms, this is true wisdom, indispensable indeed. Now the thoughts do not cease, intelligence and stratagems increase daily; this is the heart of knowing and perceiving, called wisdom in men, but in our Way it is considered evil fire. Why so? Where there is thought and intelligence, there is private heart engaged in scheming and rivalry; with such private heart, gaining it brings joy, losing it brings anger; anger is evil fire, causing great harm to body and mind. Hence it is said: ‘When the fire of anger and hatred is kindled, the fetal breath leaves like a swift horse; only when the fire is extinguished and smoke dissipated does it return to the dwelling.’ Therefore the cultivator most fears the fire of anger and hatred. To remove this fire, nothing is better than guarding dullness and clumsiness, using no wit or cleverness; not only not using, but must forget it; then true breath begins to grow. The old sages who attained the Way were mostly simple and ignorant folk. Once Ziguang saw an old man carrying a water jar to water his garden; he said, ‘Why not use the advantage of a lever and pulley?’ The man replied, ‘That is mechanical; wherever there is a mechanical thing, there is a mechanical heart; I do not do so.’ This could only be seen by an immortal. I today do not wish for much intelligence, only that I may be like Yan Hui, who let go of cleverness and rejected brightness, using ear and eye only as tools without engaging them, thus able to have one heart not two, and the Way may then be had. Furthermore, the rise of anger is the greatest burden to true breath; how can it then be absent? The important thing is only one awareness. Before the heart gives rise to anger, I take stillness and settlement as principle; once anger arises in movement, I only use awareness to illuminate it, striving to have it arise and vanish at once, so that no harm comes to the elixir. From this we may see that movement is yang and fire, rest is yin and water; in all bodily and mental movement, one must carefully observe. The old practiced caution in solitude for this reason. In brief, at movement and rest, everywhere and always, one must have no vexing thoughts. Know that to have no vexation of desire, one must first remove thought and stop up the curtain of the eye; then movement is stillness, rest is stillness; thus movement and spirit and breath are one, rest and spirit and breath are one; naturally daily filling and monthly flourishing, learning thus one attains the golden immortal. I see many who have family affairs, with wife and children, cannot be like the alchemist who roams freely outside with no business; they must respond to relationship and repay all things; if not careful, thoughts entangle, this is mundane fire harming the elixir. I now specially show the highest method of refinement. You must respond to affairs as they come, not be heedless, yet not overly calculating; only be calm and settled, with each thought past let it go, with each movement of thought forget it. Thus responding, though with thousands of threads day and night, no harm comes. Such use of mind is use without use, not using yet using, increasing intelligence and wisdom, increasing quietude and serenity; this is the constant Way, and true breath daily grows full. I see those who practice for years, with disease hard to clear, all because movement of thought sparks fire and harms primal breath. If following the law and practice, primal breath grows strong, all diseases gradually vanish, and longevity may be obtained.  
### Three
Though it is said that man’s alchemical refinement involves the double cultivation of nature and life, in truth the refinement of the heart is the primary matter. When the heart’s ground is pure and clear, the great harmony breath freely rests there. To recognize this breath as true, to gather this breath as real, only a hundred days are needed to establish the foundation, ten months to form the embryo, three years to transcend and detach. Hence the ancients said: ‘Toil for two or three years, and enjoy thousands of years of happiness.’ Otherwise, to merely refine the medicine without first refining the heart, I have yet to see success. Therefore I think the refinement of the heart is the foremost difficulty. Observe that ancient sages and immortals have spent twenty or thirty years without entering the gate, all because their hearts have never been cleansed; though possessing the secret of the mysterious gate, how could they proceed? Thus the refinement of the heart is the first step in practice. Yet refinement of the heart is not confined to sitting upright and practicing stillness. Formerly Master Qiu said: ‘I studied the Way in noisy places, surpassing quiet places a hundredfold.’ Again, Master Lü saw the monk Fazhen of Kaiyuan Temple, who had sat in meditation for over twenty years, somewhat observing precepts but without knowing the true Way. When a Daoist entered the temple and asked Fazhen, ‘What do you study?’ he said, ‘Sitting upright and quiet cultivation.’ Lü said, ‘Can sitting produce the Way?’ Fazhen replied, ‘Yes.’ Lü said, ‘In studying the Way, one must first refine the heart; after refining the heart, one must especially subdue the breath; after subduing the breath, whether asleep or awake, the Way is present therein. Is the Way found in sitting?’ Fazhen did not understand. Lü then went to the hall to observe a monk sitting in meditation a long time; a small snake emerged from the top of his head, crawling down the left leg of the bed into the urinal, then onto the flower terrace, crossing the drainage ditch. Lü stabbed it with a knife; the snake fled to the right leg of the bed and returned into the monk’s head. This shows the heart’s ground is not pure, transformed into a poisonous snake, full of illusions and delusions; how could such attain the Way? Again, Master Ma sat upright in the Long Forest and was mocked with grinding bricks as mirrors. In sum, the cultivator must not depart from the Way in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, all four postures. Zisi said: ‘The Way cannot be left even for a moment. That which can be left is not the Way.’ Yet this Way is subtle, not to be grasped by stepping; better thus than what my master showed: nature is a compassionate thing; life is the vaporous primal breath within the body. Yet always cherish the thought of settling and following the heart, lively and vigorous breath, constantly pondering, never allowing a moment’s wandering, never letting a thought be mixed; this is what the ancients meant by ‘not leaving this in walking, standing, sitting, or lying.’ This is the work of the mind and the root of learning. Furthermore, learning begins with not deceiving oneself in the dark room, also called caution in solitude. In all sights, sounds, words, and movements, be fully aware of yourself at every moment; if slightly contrary to Heaven’s principle, immediately extinguish it. Such heart refinement is nowhere not the Way. Especially must one add the work of breath regulation, then it is the study of refining life. But breath regulation is not to hold the breath; it requires slow management: at first there is breath, after long time the breath is slight, after still longer the breath is gone; this is the true study of life. Hence it is said: ‘Subdue breath but not hold breath; hold breath but not long life; long life requires subduing breath.’ This subduing must be clearly understood; do not simply hold the breath for a few counts. The heart must have no moving in or out; the breath must have no moving in or out; then it is the study of the combined cultivation of nature and life. Yet even this is not enough. Life begins with one thought. I must recognize the true thought from chaos as the foundation of the elixir, and at the arising and conflict of true breath with form as the head of the elixir; then performing the work of the river cart, thus the Way of longevity is obtained. Practicing thus will not be like monk Fazhen sitting in meditation for twenty years without meeting a master, and utterly failing to attain. Now that you know this method, you must use a clear and constant observing mind, never ceasing; thus in three years the great Way will surely be accomplished. In sum, refining the heart and subduing the breath must be cultivated together; if only refining the heart, the body and life will be difficult to secure; if only subduing breath, though longevity may be, it is folly. Life must treat both as method, never departing from them at any time.  
### Four
The Way says to refine oneself; it is not for one who sits alone in purity and quiet to obtain the luminous nature. Hence Master Lü refined the Way in wine shops and brothels, Master Qiu nourished the elixir in the Lichun Courtesan House. Even those of the highest endowment must thus temper their nature and disposition, to return to simplicity; how much more then you beginners, ought you not to temper yourselves, to remove the private dispositions of temperament and the veil of worldly desire? Without speaking of signs of success, even now to practice the river cart and restore the jade elixir to prolong life, without several trials and tribulations, how can one see through the red dust? If one has not seen through, though cultivating, a heart full of lust, sound, goods, profit, love and entanglement will surely not be let go; to old age not letting go, in death likewise so. You, with thick carpets and heavy shoes, accustomed to comfort and ease, seldom suffer torment; placed in the midst of waves and billows, noisy and tumultuous, only upon quiet does one taste joy, then one knows wife and children all belong to dustly fate, even the body of flesh and blood is but a vehicle of illusion; except the Way, all has no interference with me. Thus when dust and filth are cleared, there is medicine; when gathering yang, there is yang; when firing the elixir, there is elixir. Otherwise, with a body full of private desires, how can lead flowers appear? Though there be water and fire, spirit and breath not broken, once the mind moves, how can Kan and Li join? Yin and yang cannot unite, whence then come the primordial one breath? Confucius’ three warnings, Yan Hui’s four avoidances, truly enter the utmost truth of the sage, the essential words of self-refinement. Yet even this is not enough. Cultivation depends on essence, breath, and spirit; if essence is not treasured and breath not abundant, spirit does not enter breath, breath does not subdue spirit, they cannot be unified; like male essence and female blood each in its place, never joining, how can there be birth of sons and daughters? The cultivator seeks the one primal breath; at first water and fire do not mingle, how can true lead be produced? When true yang moves, without practicing the river cart to mate Qian and Kun, how can the elixir be formed? Thus spirit comprehends spirit, breath comprehends breath, if not conjoined, how can there be breath without cessation to form the prenatal body of the Way, spirit without spirit to correspond with the two great Qian and Kun? You must recognize the prenatal essence, breath, and spirit, then refine it, facing beautiful scenes without moving; permitting splendour and splendour without altering; only then advancing fire and practicing talismans, metal born in water, advancing fire with moderation, fire enclosed without bursting, withdrawing talismans with results; daily moving your own mercury to envelop and solidify the yang essence. This is the essential study of self-refinement, also the real work of transforming temperament. I wish disciples at the beginning of self-refinement not to spare labour and weariness, so that upon entering the chamber the six roots are completely settled and not a single thought arises; then surely one attains the state of chaos, with dimness and oblivion. This is the one orifice of the prenatal breath coming from non-being; also the one orifice of the mysterious gate arising from nothing; thus exactly as when I was born and received breath. Why? In former years, incarnation and possession, from dimness one thought came, conjoined with parental essence and blood. Now without conformity but in opposition, the yin and yang Kan and Li unite in one region to seek my prenatal true intention and breath. The true intention is the master of my incarnation; the true breath is the dwelling of my incarnation; the true intention is the principle I receive from Heaven to complete nature; the true breath is the destiny from Heaven to form shape. Only when self-refinement is thorough is there true spirit and true breath, conjoined with the clear, empty, and spiritual yang breath of Heaven and Earth into one. Then advancing, retreating, warming and nourishing day and night without slackening, after long time transforming shape and completing the Way of the immortal. Nowadays learners do not know the great matter of self-refinement, acting rashly for a moment or two hoping to obtain medicine and form elixir, not only without benefit but with the mind running wild, moving and wandering recklessly, postnatal fire rising, surely harming the elixir and burning the body, not only unable to dispel disease and prolong life but rather increasing disease and shortening life. You must strive. In all, hard practice and endurance of insult, driving out the inner demons, accumulating功 and virtue, removing external obstacles of many kalpas, then naturally the heavenly spirits will protect, and great elixir may be completed.  
### Five
The Way of alchemy commences with the seeking of the void within the midst of duality, the having within the midst of Kan; then when the yang breath begins to move, the having within Kan meets the void within Li. The names of having and not having must have their meanings of having and not having. You must know that yang gives birth to form; once taken and refined, it is wholly transformed into void; such void is the medicine of emptiness and purity, the elixir of emptiness and purity; this is where the unborn dwells, like a bright moon. If one can deeply comprehend the origin, not falling into the grooves of common men, when it has form it is the having within void; when it is void it is the not having within form. Though the one yang first moves, the time of the living seed has come, the vital breath seems to have form and image, but in truth the heart has nothing; this is prenatal having, and is true having. When the medicine breath returns, mercury and lead mingled as one, though called void, in reality the movement of vital breath is not wholly like void. Such void is the having within not having, truly void. Thus it is having and not having, only the movement and rest of vital breath; its true essence is neither in having nor not having, yet is not outside having and not having. In sum, that which flows and moves is breath; that which is empty, bright, and penetrating is spirit. Only within the vital breath is this clear spiritual scene; then it is obtained. Further I show you the essentials of spirit and breath. Breath arises and moves, yet if the heart and spirit are not greatly bright, this spirit is not yet united with breath; this is called lead arriving and mercury not responding. If the heart and spirit are bright, yet the vital breath is not fully abundant and overflowing, this breath is not yet united with spirit; this is called mercury thrown in and lead not coming. When lead and mercury have fused as one, then with the Tathagata’s empty heart, combined with the true man’s deep breath, they mutually swallow and devour in the yellow chamber. When stillness is extreme there is movement, then hastening to kindle fire; when movement is extreme there is stillness, one must then stop talisman, letting it rise and fall freely, conforming to the creation of Heaven and Earth, and the waxing and waning of sun and moon; this is the small circuit method. The ancients said: one day has twelve hours, all may be used; if aware, use; if not aware, do not use. The great circuit method is not like the small circuit having intervals; it is said to have no coming or going, no advance or retreat, no increase or diminution, no drawing in or adding; one day and night only continuous and dense, never twofold nor ceasing; movement thus, rest thus; walking, sitting, lying, all are so; the only thing required is a single clear observing mind constantly awake, without interruption; if interrupted even a little, it is no different from running the elixir, thus it is the great circuit heaven refining spirit and returning to void, the great creation. My teaching to you is: first refining the heart is essential. Nowadays many cultivators do not begin thus, and later fall. You should carefully observe this.  
### Six
The primal spirit is the general mechanism of alchemy. Without this primal spirit the medicine is merely vulgar essence, useless and unable to form the embryo; the returned elixir without this primal spirit is illusion, unable to form the infant. I greatly marvel at the cultivators of the world who know only essence and breath as treasure, not knowing that primal spirit is the master; though they say they have formed medicine, it is only to protect the coloured body, how can they form the sacred embryo? I now reveal it to you. The so-called cooking and refining of the yang spirit is this primal spirit gathered and taken, accumulated day by day, becoming full and flourishing month by month. Otherwise, why not say ‘yang essence, yang breath,’ and must say ‘yang spirit’? You may know that the alchemist refines this primal spirit as the one master. Yet this is the supreme method, for the great golden liquid return elixir. For middle and lower grades, though not wholly using yang spirit, they cannot be without it; without yang spirit, vulgar essence and breath cannot condense in body and mind to grow longevity and avoid aging as immortal. The highest method is pure yang spirit alone, though not separate from essence and breath, only using them as assistants. You must clearly recognize the primal spirit to have it effective. The primal spirit is limitless and ultimate. When it is quiet, void, without affairs, confused and incapable of description; when the vital breath occasionally touches, suddenly it is moved and leaps forth. This leap and movement is the true primal spirit. The Book of Changes says: ‘Quiet and unmoving, yet feeling and therefore communicating all under Heaven’; this is so. When not yet moved, the first presence of contrary thoughts is the future mind; when moved, still holding memories is the past mind; sudden feeling and sudden responding, sudden responding and sudden stopping, this is the activity of the primal spirit. If there is any calculation, unable to respond and forget at will, this is called the present mind—none is primal spirit. Taking these leads to impurity; even if nurtured, difficult to soar and transform and come and go at will. I now briefly expose these, you must use your work well to act and take accordingly. Yet it is subtle indeed! Wonderful indeed! Without superior roots and vessels, and superior learning and insight, it cannot be spoken of. Also it is said the mysterious gate’s one orifice is this occasional movement of yang spirit; also the mysterious female gate is the trigger of this yang spirit. Yet there is distinction. The female gate is the mingling of yin and yang, from which the vaporous breath of unity first shows signs. The yang spirit is the lively and alert breath among this vapor; yet though two, they are ultimately one. Therefore the Supreme says: ‘The valley spirit never dies, this is called the mysterious female gate.’ Without this yang spirit the alchemical medicine is greatly lost. Yet this primal spirit is also pure and clean, unsoiled and unstained, one heart and one virtue of true intention. In stillness, the primal spirit presides; in movement, the primal spirit presides; even in gathering as medicine, the primal spirit is at work turning and revolving. The use of the primal spirit is truly great. You must understand well and not add one thought or intention; in the twelve hours of the day, always moving and always aware, always responding and always still; fear not the myriad distractions, all are activities of this primal spirit. Otherwise falling into the postnatal Jia, that glimmer of spirit will be concealed and unseen.  
### Seven
Man in this world, who can leap beyond yin and yang, not be bound by the count of breath? Moreover, wind, cold, heat, and dampness easily invade each other; in the weak, exposure to these evil breaths often causes sickness. What a grievous affliction this is! Moreover, riches and honour, poverty and low estate, sickness and old age, death and life, as well as right and wrong, honour and disgrace, separation and union, sorrow and joy, all are unavoidable. Alas! Man’s life in Heaven and Earth is indeed a prison. You now dwell in a burning house; have you known the bitterness and hardship of life? Is it not better to be immortal and share joy? Fortunate is it that the great Way remains transmitted; you should apply your heart and practice; one kalpa of formation will save you from the troubles of birth and death through countless lives. I now wish you fortune and peril. Fortune, to have heard the Way, and at this point have the basis for becoming immortal. Peril, to practice the Way without diligence, and in the end fail to transcend Heaven and Earth. I show you a method: if you cannot cut off attachment to love and affection, name and profit, then bite your teeth and cut it off; if you cannot let go, then endure with your heart and let it go. At first it is difficult; after long time it is free from desire, free from burden, and the stage of the golden immortal may be entered. Otherwise, half up and half down, dragging mud and water, you will never transcend the three realms. Moreover, the cultivation of virtue brings the Way; one portion of virtue cultivated is one portion of the Way congealed; ten portions of virtue is ten portions of the Way congealed. Thus the Supreme’s three thousand功 and eight hundred acts are the foremost tasks of immortal cultivation. When the fruit of the Way is accomplished and you look back upon worldly riches and honour, truly they are filthy and intolerable, with loathing unable to endure sight or hearing. Consider the clear empty one breath; how can refuse be mixed therein? Just as men wear court robes and crowns, would they consort with those in mud and filth? You must strive. My master never said one word or half a word to deceive you. Recently I taught disciples to gather yang, which is to gather primal spirit. Also I said primal spirit directs among them; is this not spirit commanding spirit? No. The yang gathered is primal spirit; the spirit gathered is true intention. Using true intention to gather primal spirit, gathering essence and accumulating breath, refining and cooking, primal spirit grows strong day by day, and the golden elixir may form. Also it is said the metal of the water palace is lead born after geng; thus lead subdues mercury, then the prenatal breath emerges; cooking and feeding, refining into the mysterious yellow treasure, thus called great golden liquid return. Yet I still have more to say. Though the medicine is obtained, there must be the proper fire time; if fire time is unclear, it is difficult to form elixir. The ancients said: ‘The medicine arises in the mysterious orifice; the fire time kindles the yang furnace.’ At this time gold is refined; only a little true intention is used to gather and receive. If the medicine is not yet born, it is not harmful to gently warm the lead cauldron; hence it is said: ‘Before medicine arises, the furnace must have fierce fire; after medicine returns to the furnace, gentle warming is suitable.’ This shows that the fire of medicine arising is martial fire; the fire of medicine returning is civil fire. The yin and yang of fire time, civil and martial, differ only in intention or no intention. The rest of the circuit fire time is only gentle and mild divine fire, neither approaching nor departing, thus without danger or peril. Therefore it is said: condense the spirit, soften the intention. If spirit does not condense, elixir will not gather; if intention is not soft, fire is not pure; if fire is not pure, elixir is also difficult to form. Therefore at the time of rising and falling there are bathing, drawing, and adding; this is all. When the medicine breath has already reached the mud pellet, one must especially keep one intention unsplit, one thought unarisen, condensing spirit and gathering into one place, warming and nourishing a moment; then the brain’s yin essence turns into sweet dew divine water, dripping into the red palace, refining a moment, then turning into golden liquid, returning to the elixir field, nourishing and forming a pearl. Here it is necessary to warm the lead cauldron gently to seal and solidify. Yet this sealing and solidifying is known to men as neither appearing outwardly nor entering inwardly; if the elixir palace within gathers for a time and is cooked into medicine, few know it. For within this palace is extremely pure, void, mysterious, and clear; if fallen into postnatal, impurities clog and block; therefore spirit is not clear, mind is not alert, often inevitably confused. If able to condense for half a moment, the turbid breath descends, clear breath ascends, always communicating with the light and pure breath of Heaven and Earth. If able to warm and nourish for a long time, clear breath fills and turbid breath departs; not only body is healthy and strong, and countenance bright, but also the great golden liquid return is surely the accumulation of this quiet nourishment功.  
### Eight
The so-called true one breath is the primal breath of the undivided chaos, the initial breath of the opening of confusion; Heaven, Earth, man, and all living things are born from it; those who become immortals and Buddhas are also no different. Therefore the cultivator must recognize this breath clearly to have effect later. Though within man it pervades essence, breath, and spirit, it leaves no trace to be sought; it is not the ordinary breath of mouth and nose, nor the spiritual breath of empty and ethereal perception, nor the moving breath of the heart and kidney of Kan and Li; it dwells in the prenatal yet is unseen in the prenatal; dwells in the postnatal yet is unseen in the postnatal. The so-called ‘boundlessly and endlessly benevolent’ is the limitless development of this breath; ‘vast and immense as Heaven’ is the breath’s fullness without interval; ‘deep and deep as an abyss’ is the breath’s return and concealment without trace. Chengzi said: ‘If let loose, it fills the six directions; if rolled up, it retreats to concealment.’ The Doctrine of the Mean says: ‘Speak of the great, the world cannot contain it; speak of the small, the world cannot break it.’ This means its brightness and manifestation is everywhere, entering nowhere not, penetrating everywhere without gap or leak. Alas! The primal breath in Heaven and man is thus to the utmost; do you not know whether you have ever met it? Recently, as your vital breath begins to move, it comes unbidden, its thread still thin; if held firmly and firmly without wavering, accumulating day by day, month by month, it is nearly always the circulation of this breath. When at this stage, you will know that true one breath can indeed transcend the three realms and exit the six paths, not entering the five elements and eight trigrams. How is the divine transformation of this breath? Though not postnatal essence, breath, and spirit, nor prenatal essence, breath, and spirit, it is indeed the root of postnatal essence, breath, and spirit; the master of prenatal essence, breath, and spirit. It is unimaginable and beyond conception; how then can it be refined into a grain of millet? Only by gathering prenatal true yin and true yang breath can you long brew it in emptiness and void, and thereby obtain true one breath in the cave of void. If you do not know to gather true yin and true yang to unite prenatal breath, and seek it in postnatal yin and yang, after many years you will not obtain true one breath; even if you see fleeting shadows, you will not avoid mistaking true for false and illusion for emptiness, ending like common men. Though the start of cultivation depends on postnatal yin and yang, it must only borrow postnatal breath to gather prenatal breath. If you obtain prenatal breath, then postnatal ordinary breath is but dung; what use is it? When you have this breath, you must know to quietly and steadily nurture it day and night, not allowing evil to enter nor true breath to go forth, accumulating long, clarifying pure, freely nourishing the morning breath until vast breath arises beyond Heaven and Earth and yin and yang. At that time, human desire will naturally vanish, Heaven’s principle entirely complete; then the usual seven emotions and eight recognitions will vanish and return. This breath can almost transform desire into principle, turn killing into life. If the learner can recognize this breath as true and work day and night, then there will be lasting benefit; otherwise, it is difficult. If sitting, do not first let the six roots and six dust all fall away and then greatly rest and cease, suddenly drawing the common breath up and down to seek this true one breath; none have attained it. Only after great stillness can the true yin and true yang begin to manifest. Then I lead you to take the primal spirit down from the Li palace to watch the water palace; then the gold of the water palace flourishes and swells, rising straight from the lower field, the so-called ‘earth surging gold lotus.’ I then withdraw to the central palace, adding divine fire for long warming and nourishment; this breath then rises surging to the mud pellet, the so-called ‘Heaven lowering precious canopy.’ I condense it for a moment, storing it in the secret place of allowance; this accords with the turning of Heaven and Earth, the harmonization of fullness and emptiness, and the numbers of increase and decrease. Thus if elixir is not formed and infant not born, it has not been. This is already revealed in the hexagram Qian of the Book of Changes. Why so? ‘Initial nine, hidden dragon,’ means great rest and cessation. ‘Nine two, seeing dragon,’ means primal breath first moves in the lower field. ‘Nine three, morning Qian evening watchfulness,’ means with this breath returning to the central palace, not thinking outward or inward, preventing danger and removing faults. ‘Nine four, leaping from the abyss,’ means long quiet nurturing, suddenly perceiving a thread of true breath rushing from the lower field, though not truly existent, hence called ‘perhaps’. ‘Nine five, flying dragon,’ means this breath rises to the mud pellet, yang breath at its peak. ‘Upper nine, aroused dragon has regret,’ means this primal breath moves to the extreme and seeks stillness; I must draw it back to the one void orifice, never greedy for pleasure, so that this breath may long shine brightly, with no evils of excess. You should deeply understand the Way of Changes; have you also perceived it?

Previously I showed the one orifice of the mysterious gate, which is the method of the myriad sages transmitting the heart method. The learner beginning work must slightly close both eyes, illuminating clearly between the two elixir fields within and without, neither approaching nor departing, neither forgetting nor aiding; after long time one breath departs, one breath comes, breath by breath depending on each other, seeming to be and not be, seeming void and not void; the breath of mouth and nose seems to have no ingress or egress; this is where the common breath stops and true breath appears; sitting until breath returns to the source. Learners reaching this do not know what to do next; often, perceiving this true breath beginning to move, they hastily descend, unwilling to patiently sit quietly to refine breath and return spirit; though able to preserve the postnatal coloured body, they cannot see the prenatal original man. Upon reaching this, one must again refine by slowly blowing the prenatal primal breath toward the furnace, harmonizing long; suddenly feeling the elixir field surging and rolling, seeming not to exist yet seeming to exist, neither true nor false, as if a clear and bright breath scene; but cannot awaken bright awareness. Should bright awareness arise, one falls into postnatal perception and cannot speak of prenatal profundity. You must gather all bright awareness and not use the slightest bit; this is the meaning of scripture ‘gathering and restraining brightness, clarifying spirit and sitting in stillness.’ Thus after long bewilderment, essence naturally transforms to breath, breath to spirit, then the prenatal one true primal breath manifests, and the orifice of the mysterious gate opens wide. Yet though the orifice opens, without fierce refining by divine fire, one cannot go wherever one wishes, nor enter or depart freely; often upon seeing what is desirable, love arises; upon seeing what is fearful, fear arises. With primal breath not strong, primal spirit not mature, one cannot yet adapt and complete, respond accordingly, and float with the world, rise and fall with the times. Only by continuous and gentle breath regulation, deep nourishment of breath, letting come what may of fear, anger, joy, or sorrow, my heart has its master; not allowing any to enter and disturb my spirit and brightness. Is this not the ‘great man who dwells in broadness, stands in right place, walks the great Way, who is not inflamed by riches and honour, not moved by poverty and low estate, not bent by power and force,’ as Mencius said? You now begin work, may not yet have this scene, but cannot be said to have none. When the mysterious orifice first opens, the mechanism is very slight; as you nurture it long, you naturally collect what ordinary breath cannot; as your usual heart and spirit cannot settle, you naturally settle. Zhuzi said, ‘Last night at the river’s edge spring water arose; warships large and small are but a hair’s weight; all my pushing and pulling was in vain; today I sail freely in midstream.’ Such movement is true movement. Otherwise the breath is coarse, the spirit often wandering, not yet true manifestation. If you desire to see true orifice, only this breath regulation, heart stillness, breath leisure, and spirit peace is true grasp. Otherwise, with effort and obtaining by thought, there may be movement of the mysterious orifice, but at once it vanishes, not like this natural arising, from stillness preserving movement and observing, which lasts long. You must here fix your main brain, exert yourself with one force forward; why fear not attaining the position of heavenly immortal!

Man in the world is inferior to grass and trees which live and grow without ceasing. Some live one life as man, then are reborn into beastly paths; some live one life in blessing, then are born to cruel punishment. Is Heaven and Earth not compassionate? Grass and trees of ignorance still know to return to root and origin, to complete the cycle of life; man’s breath is constrained and fettered by things, daily declining, unable to return to original Heaven. Though Heaven has the kindness of birth and nourishment by rain and dew, it is as if physiology does not exist; the day of life ceases. Why so? My master pitied the world and specially taught man to return to origin and restore the true, free from the troubles of birth and death; even otherwise, one may preserve one’s root and not sink deeply into the three paths and six routes. I always say that the beginning of work is none other than the eyes. The eyes are the light of spirit. Learners often covet the external splendour displayed before their eyes, thinking that a golden radiance is proof of true cultivation. How do they know the Way of Heaven values collection and not display? How should the Way of man be otherwise? The ancient immortal said: ‘The sun pours forth pearls, always desiring to repel man; if one reverses and receives them, the golden splendour is contained within.’ If you do not know to reverse and delight in going with the flow, always sending your spirit forth externally, rushing about with sights, sounds, words, and deeds, desires, anger, ignorance, and love, you perish day by day and fade away; even wishing to keep this body, you cannot; how much more the body outside of body, eternal for myriads of years? Only by drawing down the curtain and blocking the veil, always drawing in my single gleam of spirit into the cave of void, going neither out nor in, without worry or thought, long so, golden light nourished enough will naturally turn into yang spirit, ruler of my body, and can transform into thousands and millions of yang spirits filling the void above and below, becoming the most profound and subtle immortal spirit; not only a single bright light, penetrating and perceiving the Tathagata! But beware the sun pouring forth pearls has intent to repel man; if I follow its flow and chase it, primal spirit will be bound daily, primal breath lost, life force thus ended. This method is not at all difficult, only requires some intention to gather the sight of the eyes. Yesterday I said the primal spirit directs among them; ultimately where is the primal spirit in man, where dwells it, where grows? Some say the square inch of heart is the dwelling of primal spirit; some say within the mysterious gate is the home of primal spirit; some say the heavenly valley primal spirit, guarding it is true. These three places are all where primal spirit resides. But you do not know where to begin at the start? The Book of Changes says: ‘Wash the heart and retreat to concealment.’ Also the ancients said: ‘The square inch of heart is my body’s hall; within the mysterious orifice is my body’s chamber.’ Most people guard spirit in the square inch of heart, ears and eyes enter and shake its essence; cultivators gather spirit within the mysterious orifice, ears and eyes have no gate, but look through its gap. Looking at it thus, at the beginning you must gather spirit in the orifice of the mysterious gate, within the circle of void; thus confused, dim, mysterious, no man, no self, no place, no Heaven; only thus can you nourish the indivisible primal spirit. If not hidden in such a secluded place, but always clear and alert in the square inch, you will surely rush to worldly passions and worldly thoughts, with no rest day and night. What is the heavenly valley? The human head has nine palaces, among them one called heavenly valley, pure and without dust; if one can place primal spirit there without wandering, then true realization and saintly proof are right there. Therefore the Yellow Court Scripture says: ‘If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.’ This shows how guarding this heavenly valley has infinite wondrous meaning. Do you know this?

Learners who desire to return to root and restore life must only let this heart be let go lightly and gently, to listen to the coming and going of breath. If breath is too coarse and floating, spirit is scattered and cannot return to the original orifice, ruler of my body. If breath seems faint and evanescent, then common breath will stop, fetal breath will manifest, and original heart can be seen. The ancients said: ‘Heart easily wanders, so purify it with breath.’ If you do not know to listen to breath to collect heart and draw in breath, spirit cannot condense, breath cannot regulate, and heart and breath cannot rely on each other. This listening to breath method is indeed the subtle secret of consolidating spirit and regulating breath. If you can enter spirit into breath and refine breath to return to spirit, then clear breath ascends and turbid breath descends, and the whole body of Heaven and Earth naturally is clear and tranquil. When Heaven is clear and Earth tranquil, you glimpse the clear empty one breath circulating within and without the whole body; this is not merely the discovery of fetal breath. You must especially know that this fetal breath is not the common breath of mouth and nose, nor the moving breath of the elixir field, nor the perceptive spiritual breath. Originally at the beginning of man’s life, father’s essence and mother’s blood mingled as one mass; at this time it is a confused thing, with no breath coming and going, only a thread of warmth linked to mother’s navel and abdomen. After birth, the umbilical cord is cut; then new breath begins, directly going in and out through mouth and nose; and a point of spiritual yang breath from Heaven and Earth falls into the middle elixir field. When common breath arises, fetal breath is blocked; no point of primal breath can dwell in the middle after leaving the mother’s belly. Yet do not say it is entirely absent. If one can have one heart quiet and settled, remove illusions, turn the light back to nose or brow orifice, it will gradually condense and settle; from the breath sea upward to the mud pellet, then circling down to the middle elixir field, what else but this fetal breath? Yet prenatal fetal breath cannot move without postnatal common breath; postnatal common breath cannot master without prenatal fetal breath. If one can stop common breath, a true chance appears; all common breath is fetal breath. If mixed thoughts are not removed, dust heart not purified, even fetal breath is common breath. Learners must know. The Way of cultivation is the same principle as the Way of Heaven and Earth’s opening. Just as now in the lower origin, the world is perverse, human hearts treacherous, also exceedingly so. If not swept away by water, fire, and weapons, how can the chaotic world have an end? The human body is likewise. Now that private desire is strong and blood and breath decline with age, if one does not first go from extreme movement gradually to stillness, then human heart will not die, the Way heart will not arise, common breath will not be removed, true breath will not be seen. Therefore at the juncture of extreme movement and stillness, suddenly true intention comes to preside; this intention belongs to yin, called the Earth of self. After a short while, in the confused and dim state, seeming dream not dream, seeming awake not awake, in this settled stillness a thread of warmth is felt, continuous and unbroken, rising and soaring; this is spirit merging and breath smooth, mutually meeting in the yellow chamber, not by feeling or touch but naturally arising; this is the sign of the mysterious gate, the foundation of the ultimate. Only one true heart is used to manifest true intention and gather it; this intention belongs to yang, called Earth of Wu. In fact, one intention is only to divide the mechanism of movement and stillness into Wu and Ji, two Earths. Because the female gate is not yet open, within confusion there is this true intention presiding, with no desire to observe marvels. When the female gate opens and the true mechanism appears, then there is the desire to see the orifice. One is the beginning of nameless Heaven and Earth; the other is mother of named myriad things. Heaven, Earth, man, and all living things, all are governed by this one point of true intention. I hasten to run true intention, so as not to be led to delusive thoughts or distracted when moved; thus Heaven is in my gate, Earth axis by my heart, universe in my body, myriad things born of the heart; all this time’s spiritual alertness is at work and presiding. Therefore it is said: to manifest one intention too early is no use; to gather it too late, common thought has already arisen, and gathering it is too mixed. You must clearly recognize this interval, purely using true intention to preside, never dispersing it. After long time, the vital breath grows strong and powerful; wherever it goes, I add no thought, consider no view, only clearly observe and preside; it is accomplished. But you at first only have an image; you must settle in stillness. When vital breath is strong and abundant, when stillness comes, heavenly mechanism activates swiftly as thunder; even in noisy places, in bustling villages, the mechanism cannot be stopped. Always have spiritual alertness, so there will be no error.

The work of cultivation is no other subtle method than to observe the Way of Heaven and to hold fast the conduct of Heaven. As in spring and summer, fruit trees luxuriantly grow, flowers and grass cover the fields, how vigorous and boundless! Who would know that within this vigorous growth is contained the intent of gathering and restraining? The ancients said that at summer solstice yin arises, but still late; in autumn and winter, things gather and wither, frost and snow congeal, how bleak and desolate! Who would know that within this decay is the contained intent of flourishing? The ancients said that at winter solstice yang arises, but still too early. From this you see yang born in yin, yin containing yang. The cultivator, when the dragon and tiger struggle, water and fire shoot at each other, like the flourishing of myriad things in spring and summer, must be as calm and free, fully clear and enlightened, not moving with the movement of vital breath; this is yang giving birth to yin. When vital breath is still, dragon descends and tiger crouches, water hard and fire soft, mutually completing each other; this is the image of autumn and winter, returning and concealing. At this time you must enter the state of dimness and obscurity, not allowing dullness like sleep, nor brightness like eternal light; in stillness be alert; in not moving with vital breath’s stillness, this is yin containing yang. I further say: the cultivator must sweep away all idle thoughts and distractions, rough breath and violent breath gathered; then postnatal yin and yang cease outside, and true yin and yang begin to arise within. The ancients said: ‘If one desires not to die, one must first die.’ If one does not patiently sit quietly to remove common thoughts and common distractions, common breath and common qi, though one says the heart can be still, spirit also peaceful, it is coarse spirit insufficient to form the Way. Only if swept clean, breath of respiration as faint as may be, thoughts and spirit have no exit or entrance, may one sit quietly and obscurely, only as master sitting in the central courtyard, unmoving and unshaken. Thus warming and nourishing, true yang will naturally arise from the cave of void. If not moved by others, but moved by the heart pushing the dipper, it all arises from my creating and imagining, endlessly moving and carrying, through all years and months, only postnatal knowledge spirit raising postnatal common breath; thus it cannot form elixir. You must diligently cultivate in the interval of heart and breath depending, in the mingling of yin and yang, nurturing and nourishing long, surely making my true yin and true yang condense into a millet-sized pearl; then there is true seed. Even with true seed, one must not desire rapid success and expect the jade liquid elixir to form; one must wait for the millet pearl’s water and fire to eliminate and nurture, truly to mature as the fetus and infant in the mother’s womb, with viscera, limbs, and all hundred bodies complete, then complete a perfect person. I see you often upon entering dimness arise calculation and thought; otherwise many sink into dim sleep, never as master to calm spirit and sit quietly to guard within. Hence no cultivator has no elixir; only because bright awareness arises and clings to postnatal knowledge spirit and scatters; or bright awareness does not arise, or spirit is confused and breath weary and perishes; thus elixir does not form, Way is hard to complete. From now on, whenever sitting quietly, regardless of dimness or not, always let my primal spirit manifest as true intention to preside; when dimness arrives and yin and yang mingle in one region, I preside with true intention; even if dimness is long, true yang arises, I preside and transform with primal spirit; no adding one view or one intention; this is my master’s highest method of cultivation.

The matter of cultivation is not other subtle methods, only to observe the Way of Heaven and hold fast the conduct of Heaven. As at the juncture of spring and summer, fruit trees luxuriate, flowers and grass fill the fields; how vigorous and boundless! Who would know that within the flourishing is contained the intent of gathering and restraining? The ancients said that at summer solstice yin arises, but late; in autumn and winter, things gather and wither, frost and snow congeal, how bleak and desolate! Who would know that within this decay lies the contained intent of flourishing? The ancients said that at winter solstice yang arises, but not yet. From this you see yang born in yin, yin containing yang. The cultivator, when dragon and tiger struggle, water and fire shoot at each other, like the flourishing of myriad things in spring and summer, must be calm and free, fully clear and enlightened, not moving with vital breath; this is yang giving birth to yin. When vital breath is still, dragon descends and tiger crouches, water hard and fire soft, mutually completing each other; this is the image of autumn and winter, returning and concealing.

Recently the matter of cultivation is, sitting down to store spirit and enter listening, laying down all conditions, then drawing down the curtain and closing the veil, turning the light back and illuminating the mysterious orifice. At first spirit may not condense, breath may be coarse; it does no harm to use several breaths of martial fire, gently uniting your intent, settling your spirit. After a short while, spirit condenses and breath settles; then let heart and spirit open, unmoving, contemplating the void orifice, only preserving heart in listening to breath. This listening has great method. Zhuangzi said: ‘Unite your intent, listen not with the ear but with the heart, listen not with the heart but with breath.’ You must know this breath is not the breath of mouth and nose, not the moving breath between kidneys, much less the spiritual breath of the heart. This breath is the primal breath of emptiness and void, which gave birth to Heaven, Earth, man, and all living things. Only by holding the heart in this single breath of void does the heart and spirit correspond with the great harmony primal breath; spirit and breath are one, refined and made into elixir. If relying on common breath, it is not yet spirit mingling with common breath; how can elixir form? The scripture says: ‘Spiritless spirit is true spirit; breathless breath is true breath.’ I must from chaos bring forth a point of prenatal true intention, by which I gather primal breath; this is spirit mingling with breath, and the great Way may be accomplished. If there is coarse breath, I lightly and gently collect this common breath to stillness. When common breath stops, whatever the primal breath’s movement, it is free therein. I then condense spirit rightly, embrace intention in listening; this is also one end of yin and yang mingling. Moreover at the beginning, all orifices of mouth, nose, eyes, and ears can be firmly closed, only the ear orifice not yet fully closed. I with one heart listen, thus ear orifice often closed, and all orifices without sound. This method of listening is the first good method of cultivation. Long listening naturally causes true yang to arise, and the phenomenon of the mysterious female gate appears.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast, there are spirits and gods ruling within, deciding fortune and misfortune. The ancients said: ‘In dark rooms and leaking houses, ghosts and spirits are always present. They stand nearby or above; this is not a fanciful vision, but truly there are forms in your room.’ Therefore if man can clear and quiet his heart, without selfishness or desire, all with whom he associates are none but clear and vast spirits. If confused and blocked, cunning and evil lustful, all summoned are demons and monsters. This shows like attracts like, breath seeks breath, and all matters in the world are so. Seeing this, how can the work of caution in solitude be neglected? I have transmitted the method of listening to breath, also a name; it only teaches you to close the three treasures completely, without a particle of drifting breath attaching outside; this is called ‘true breath not leaking a particle, then great elixir can condense.’ You must also know that to listen without the method of listening, if one is attached to trace or intention, one falls into boundary and direction, and cannot speak of the original Way. Do you understand? You must only condense spirit in the void, unite breath in the desolation, always alert to Heaven, lively to Earth, illuminating all in the body, yet illuminating nothing in the body; thus the Way is had. As to the nostril orifice, originally when father and mother mingled essence and blood as one mass, within this vapor there is a thread like a silk wrapping the body; at this time borrowing mother’s breath, it gradually blows and grows, finally forming the Ren and Du meridians; thus the two nostrils are called ancestors by the ancients. Upon birth, separate gates open, establishing Qian and Kun, and breathing begins. At this time, prenatal and postnatal breaths are still united. When knowledge arises and private desire begins, blocking outside pure breath is but a crowd of agitated breath, and the clear, empty breath of Heaven and Earth gradually opposes. Therefore youth grows, and vigor wanes with age. My master pitied the world, birth and death uncertain, transmigration ceaseless; therefore he showed the way to return; first taught men to observe the tip of the nose, imitating the principle of Heaven and Earth giving birth to living things, reversely cultivating it in the body to become immortal who grows and does not age. Know that this method is not principle. You must have the thought of seeing without seeing, of heart without heart, then grasp its essence. Others, refining essence into breath, though the beginning base, you must know that without essence there is no breath or spirit, just as a lamp without oil has no fire or light. But to say refining essence without knowing birth of essence, how will it be used? The Yellow Emperor said: ‘If essence is insufficient, supplement it with taste.’ Later people explained this as moderation in diet and light taste. The ancients also said: ‘Essence is born of stillness.’ The adepts erroneously move essence by massage and shaking. Guangchengzi said: ‘Do not shake your essence, do not labor your form, do not let your thoughts be busy; then you may live long.’ This shows the way of preserving essence is to avoid bodily movement and mental confusion. The ancients said: ‘Essence moves from emotion; essence desires to move but must restrain emotion; emotion arises from seeing with the eyes; once emotion arises, close the eyes.’ Thus the way of preserving essence is complete. If one can condense spirit and regulate breath in the square inch, with one heart not scattered, one breath not out, like Heaven’s breath descending, Earth’s breath ascending, joining above and below, naturally forming rain; is not the birth of essence like this? Only fear the heart is not still and breath not regulated, the joining of above and below is not mixed; thus essence daily diminishes. When spiritual fluid descends in the heart, there is no form or colour to see, but the yin essence of the mud pellet transforms into sweet dew; this may be glimpsed but requires diligent cultivation. Otherwise, attachment or absence wears away essence. When essence has transformed to breath, then spirit and breath mingle, heart and breath depend on each other; the body inside and outside is calm and harmonious, soft and like cotton; this is the sign of breath birth. But when breath is born, the mysterious orifice opens. The ancients said: ‘Yang breath begins to arise, the body naturally erects like a high mountain; the heart naturally condenses like clear autumn moon water.’ Flowing and merging, its wonder is unutterable. Hence the ancients said: ‘Strange and marvelous! The mysterious gate suddenly changes, like a woman conceiving. Breath occasionally stops, body and mind joyful and serene. Spirit and breath truly mingle, myriad orifices and channels open.’ At this time there is the unknown entering spirit into breath, breath into spirit; yet not entirely without affairs, only at the utmost of dimness, there is such a scene, quiet and serene with natural alertness. Wherever inside and outside the body there is slight movement, all is felt. Later refining breath into spirit, warming and nourishing the palace of the mud pellet, all impurities cleared, spirit is seen and breath not seen. You must understand this well, so as not to err and enter the wrong path.

In cultivation work, one step further, there is yet another step, until true emptiness and subtle existence; then the great man’s功 is complete
