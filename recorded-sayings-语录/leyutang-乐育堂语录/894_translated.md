## Records of the Hall of Joyful Cultivation, Volume Three (Section Twenty-Six)
### 1
From ancient times masters and venerables have transmitted the Way, but few have been like me today, directly and simply pointing the way, surely to the utmost thoroughness, leaving not a single thread of residue. Is it that the former sages were unable to transmit? It is only due to the differing circumstances of the times. Even now men's hearts are sunk in mire, the ways of the world are drenched and dissipated; the subtlety of the Great Way remains scarcely at all. The ruin of the world's teachings is as perilous as piled eggs; those sunk in rote memorizing of words and phrases are countless. Even those who are earnest in the sacred learning, who practice with body and strength, for three or five years do not attain true joy; many children lecture, white-headed and bewildered, not knowing the essence, nor tasting the meaning. Though by habit and long practice deeply dyed, their original nature and desires for things at last are regarded as natural; yet all this is due to the great corruption of instruction, not obtaining the true reality to bring about the effect. Some say, the explanations of the Four Books and Five Classics, the annotations of the myriad philosophers, have lately reached mountainous volumes, surpassing former ages—how can it be said that instruction has no method? The offices and schools of prefectures and counties, the halls and schools, the masters and disciples, then filled the whole land, more than of old. How then is it said that there is nowhere to nourish? Alas, this is ignorance of the reason why; though one reads the five cartloads, it is of no profit; though one lectures in tens of thousands of seats, what advantage? Therefore the more words, the more obscure the Way; the more masters, the more tangled the teaching. For they are none who truly inherit the Way; their talk is but influence and vague theory. Not only is it of no use, but it does harm. The common saying is, "To know the three-forked road ahead, one must ask those who have passed along it." If one does not truly know, though he speak much, what profit? If one does not reach the practice, though he clearly shows, all is false. Hence the world declines and the Way is subtle; both above and below rush to the field of fame and profit; few know that benevolence and righteousness are the true land of our joy. Alas! The Way does not prevail because the Way is not made clear; and because the Way is not made clear, the non-prevailing of the Way is more manifest. My master, seeing and grieving in heart, could not bear that the Great Way should be abandoned and lost to this extreme; therefore this time what is transmitted must be like an old magistrate judging a case, not ceasing until he searches to the end. You scholars, fortunate to meet this time, your previous affinities and roots have long been tied. Nevertheless, if you do not hear my teachings, nor receive my exhortations, even if your roots are not broken and your spirit remains, after three or five or fifty years you cannot thoroughly penetrate the origin and return to your original nature. If your merit is not accumulated and your virtue not gathered, even if day and night you lecture until the end of your life, there will be no sign of clear penetration and accomplishment of the True Way. Therefore my master in transmitting the Way always makes establishing merit and virtue the foremost task; otherwise, demonic obstacles are hard to dispel and cultivation is oft obstructed; the ignorant turn against my Way as not true. My master sets up instruction on this mountain; those who obtain my true transmission are but a few persons—how difficult is it to find talent! Mencius said, "To obtain the talent of the world and educate them is threefold joy." I deeply trust his words. Such few persons, each has root and affinity; all value virtue and conduct; therefore their words are easily received. Were it not for these few, my teaching would become but painted cakes. I myself am wearied in heart and strength; having attained the true fire of samadhi, yet awaiting the completion of merit and practice, when the furnace fire is perfect and pure, then can I leap out of the mire and pass straight to the further shore. I myself add fierce boiling and urgent refining, surely the elixir will form with form; the joy is endless. Looking back upon sounds, colours, goods, profits, and the land of love and favour, all are nets and snares of sin; nothing worth binding the heart. This is the true proof of attaining the Way. As for the Great Elixir without form, the Great Way without image, whether it be or not, man cannot see it, nor himself know it. Only the matters of earthly honour and family delight, the daily attachments most clung to, in this have attainment; it is weightier in this, naturally lighter in that; joyful in this, naturally hateful in that; there is a cutting off without expectation, and naturally no care—this is true flowing forth, the true proof of gain in the Great Way. I now admonish and warn: if you seek to transcend the mundane dust, to be born onto the further shore, attaining the true joy of Confucius and Yan, to be the perfected man of Heaven and Earth, you must first practice almsgiving and extensive observance of secret righteousness, rising high to the heavens; then all grievances will be fully dispelled, so as to be without obstruction. Hence it is said, "If the vulgar desire the heavenly treasure, they must at once abandon worldly wealth." Again it is said, "If the vulgar could know attainment, the heavenly immortals would be like flowing water." Great indeed! Though the Way is impartial and without private favour, it also does not permit unworthy men to enter. Is this Heaven partial? If not so, how could good and evil be clearly distinguished, how could retribution be manifest? I myself have seen thus far, but am not yet fully ripe. When fully ripe, the joy is unspeakable; then you will know why the ancients killed their bodies to achieve righteousness, renounced life to choose justice, things which men regard as fearful paths, but they saw as joyful realms. How much less then their lesser, external things? Students must reach this place before they can lightly regard the mundane dust. You scholars, ask your hearts: is it so? Or not?

### 2
The essence of Heaven and Earth has no other wondrous meaning but one utter emptiness. If one can grasp and firmly establish oneself in the emptiness, naturally daily increase and monthly flourish; learning gathers brightness. Is this only to be possessed of the six supernatural powers? Yet to speak of its substance, it is originally emptiness; because of life afterwards, qi encloses and things obstruct, like an empty house originally vast and clear, only for the accumulation of filth and dust within, then the brightness is no longer bright. To speak of its function, it is again most subtle; only because of habitual defilement like gold buried in mud and sand, the brightness is not bright. Therefore my Way teaches no other than the two words emptiness and fullness. Just as gold at the bottom of water, with a rising misty appearance—this is fullness. And rising and falling, listening naturally, without intention, it is fullness yet emptiness. Again like the spiritual Yang one qi originally without sound or odour—this is emptiness—and the mutual calling, gathering in the furnace and cauldron, refining into the embryo infant, this is emptiness yet fullness. Such emptiness in fullness, fullness in emptiness, is the foundation of becoming immortal and sage. Alas, people nowadays know to cultivate emptiness and stillness, yet cling only to emptiness and stillness on one side; know only to be grounded, yet cling only to groundedness on the other side. This is a superficial emptiness, not true emptiness; a dead fullness, not true fullness. Why so? The Way is originally without name or form, without fixed place. It must be without place and fixed location, yet seem to have place and proceed therefrom, to accord with the subtlety embracing both emptiness and fullness. Those who cling to non-attachment and attachment, though differing in what they fall into, all have this one disease—not the subtlety of the Great Way. You scholars regard what my master today has shown as the foundation; may you increasingly surpass and increasingly perfect, the longer the more harmonious, unlike before when sitting was brief and spirit and qi soon weary. Should any laziness or weariness arise, no need to seek elsewhere—only ask your own heart whether it is empty or not, whether the qi is full or not. If too empty, empty without attachment, surely mind and spirit will fly away; wandering thoughts and miscellaneous distractions will arise from no place to settle. Or if grounded, full yet not empty, like bearing on shoulders and back, holding with hands and walking with feet, day and night without rest or pause, how can there be no weariness or boredom or exhaustion? You must know it is empty, yet I have no intention to be empty; it is full, yet I seem to forget its fullness. To so conduct oneself is as Mencius said, "As Yu goes through the water, going where there is no trouble." Because there is no intention towards the matter, naturally there is no matter in the mind; then spirit does not toil or disturb, qi is not burdened; all merges as one; naturally spirit blends and qi flows freely, the heart is open and spirit joyful. Cultivated long in this way, none fail to attain the meaning and endure sitting. All depends on your heart's comprehension and understanding; do not permit a single thought to disorder your spiritual mansion and confuse your nature. You have lately approached my Way and attained the true samadhi, only because you apply the fire to gather the medicine too much on the fullness side, and thus see no interest, so sitting long causes weariness. Only because the Way does not harmonize with emptiness and nothingness, is it unlike my original things and matters. No wonder the qi and blood do not flow freely, sitting long the body aches and it is hard to complete a cycle. The Way of alchemical refining first requires solid groundedness, beginning with guarding the center, then guiding forth the original colour and form. If not grounded, how can one soar in emptiness? Therefore Sanfeng said, "Condense spirit and regulate breath in the elixir field. The heart resting below the navel is called condensing spirit; the breath returning to the original sea is called regulating breath; guard its clearness and purity naturally is not to forget; follow its clearness and purity naturally is not to assist." So long and so long, the heart and spirit flow freely, the breath is graceful, no human effort needed; naturally spirit has no birth or death, breath has no coming or going; all is quiet and at ease. At this time one will have the spirit without spirit, breath without breath, following its own movement, heeding its coming and going, as if I and spirit and breath are harmonious as one, or as if I and spirit and breath have no connection. This is to put down and again put down; then Yang arises with form. When Yang arises I gather it back into the furnace, invert and reverse, return to creation, to complete the supreme golden immortal. Therefore those who use effort are certainly not of the Way; those who use no effort cannot accomplish themselves. One must use effort first, then follow the course; this is what is called "Do all in human affairs, then obey Heaven's decree." Your recent work must be at places of effort; where you should know to gain; where you should not use effort, just listen naturally—this is a great error, understand? Yesterday I heard the living say, "Where spirit is quiet and breath regulated there is meeting, yet spirit stirs and will not return," this is not movement of spirit, but qi mechanism not yet at nature; inevitably conflict arises in the heart. There is no other method; only sit as the host, one spirit shining alone, restraining others, not permitting their wandering, harmonizing them, not letting them be disturbed; long so, qi will be quiet, spirit peaceful; how can one have trouble with spirit coming and going? Again they say, "The heart of Heaven is the master, the original spirit is the use." The heart of Heaven is still and unmoving, yet there is one chief brain; the original spirit, after being moved and communicated with, knows not whence it comes. All this is natural and spontaneous; one spirit is bright, all phenomena are empty; though daily employing a hundred tasks, the heart of Heaven and original spirit are not thereby increased or diminished. If you can recognize this message, then you know to refine my emptiness and nothingness Yang as the foundation of my becoming immortal and sage. Alas, this heart of Heaven and original spirit, few cultivators can truly recognize its truth. Know that it is always present, but lay down all attachments, and my own ruler is at ease. Even on days when private desires fill the chest, my ruler is still at ease, only occasionally clouded by desires for things. For beginners who have not yet attained spirit clear and qi fresh, though there is heart of Heaven and original spirit, still not fully clear. I now show you: only in stillness and unmoving is there one ruler, not allowing external things to stir and disturb, this is to refine my heart of Heaven. When moved and communicated with, there must also be a ruler, not allowing my spiritual Yang to be dragged away by things, this is to refine my original spirit. How can there not be accumulating day by day, month by month, to form a supreme spirit immortal? In sum, learners at the start must be like bloody battle; one blow leaves a mark, one stick draws blood; use ten parts of qi strength, then there is gain. Otherwise drifting lazily, one day cold and ten days hot, no one succeeds. What my master says today, every phrase touches the work closely. But one must endure toil patiently, be fierce and brave and diligent; then clear again and again, still and yet still, unaware of confusion and darkness, true Yang arises, and one is like a fool or drunkard. Store long and long, and a true man will appear. Not like side-door petty arts which only solidify essence to make illusory spirits!

### 3
Discussing Yang’s arising is not one thing; there is Yang arising from external movement, as shown before. If Yang arising from internal movement, I have not yet spoken intimately. Internal Yang arising is truly born naturally from long stillness and concentration. There is that which occurs upon occasional entering of samadhi, immediately arising; this is spirit entering qi, harmonizing as one. I here further cultivate, within the natural spiritual fire, letting it be still and moving, moving and still, circling in the cauldron, then using external symbolic fire, heeding its coming and going, movement and rest, the so-called "circling the twelve nodes, when the node is finished one must attend personally." When the internal fire is vigorous, the external fire will reciprocate within the body, vast and hazy without end; this is the sign of qi encompassing spirit without. At this time I only sit as the host, steady in the middle palace, striving that internal thoughts do not arise, external thoughts do not enter. You scholars have lately reached this point, yet to my master’s eyes, it is not fully according to method. When retreating the symbols, only no thought no care, as if reaching a fine scene, unaware and drifting off; because not yet fully trained, it does no harm to count the breaths of the small circuit to call back; long so until the transformation stage, no need to move and shift, and my body flourishes, above is steaming qi, below is water essence, circulating throughout the body with no end; this breath is unbidden and self-regulating, essence not forcibly refined but self-refined, the so-called "true flute without holes," also called "long blowing holeless flute, with time drums and stringless qin." This is not my own composition. Master Lü said, "Nurture the twofold: internal spiritual fire and external symbolic fire. Preserve ten months, leave the active and arrive at the inactive." Though it be said inactive, one must know that within inactivity there is a true ruler controlling me, so as not to be empty. Also one must turn the light back and forth, counting breaths as if countless, only then preserving true Yang, growing the embryo infant. Master Liu said, "One breath goes, one breath comes, breaths mutually depend, do not stray." From this view, internal spiritual fire must be at ease and content, balanced and central; external symbolic fire is the nurturing fire; only add one degree of caution, with ten parts of clear illumination, heeding each breath’s return to its root, each in samadhi, transforming into natural spiritual symbols, without one jot of human effort, this suffices. I have observed you at the beginning of sitting, you also know to count breaths to gather this original qi; upon return many hasten to descend, so once descending the original qi is gone. Also when about to reach the fine scene, not yet fully stable, suddenly the heart is vexed and restless, cannot endure long; so before descending the original qi disperses. This work needs long stillness and more stillness, endurance and more endurance; sit until the heavenly flowers fall, the blood and qi in the whole body naturally leap; my body is as vast as the great void, as if without form, yet as if wrapped in the mechanism of qi, like a spring silkworm spinning its cocoon. I here only have one bright spirit, shining alone in the midst; inward and outward wholly forgotten, being and non-being unestablished—this is true explanation. You scholars have long accumulated sincerity, deeply formed thoughts; thus I transmit at once the nurturing spiritual fire and symbolic fire. From today you must before sitting arrange all clearly. Even if sudden matters arise, if truly urgent, no harm in descending to meet them; if not urgent, no need to inform. Whether effective or not, must use a little spiritual light to shine, to manage for me. In moving, sitting, lying, all is so. In seeing, hearing, speaking, moving, none is otherwise. Applying this to myriad things and troubles, hardships arising one after another, there is none not following the middle way at ease. Only fear that the human heart does not die, the Way heart is hard to arise, again wandering confusedly; today so, tomorrow so, thus through the year no progress. If you can keep to my words, none will fail.

The one orifice of the mysterious gate, true Yang arises at the hour of the child’s birth. Master Lü said, "All things have not a single odour; beneath the earth hear the sound of thunder." Ancient immortals said, "Suddenly at midnight a thunderclap, ten thousand households and a thousand gates open in order." Thunder! Thunder! Spirit indeed, spirit indeed! From these two sayings, can it be that the opening of the mysterious orifice and the movement of true Yang have no real proof in the coloured body, but are only metaphorically thunder’s sound? Ancestor Zhang again said, "Thunder sounds faintly shaking the void, seeking the true seed where lightning flashes." Ancient immortal masters all likened it to thunder’s roar; why so? I now directly point out: that is the time of entering samadhi, suddenly spirit and qi join, reaching the place of true emptiness, unaware of sleep, breathing laboured; startled awake. This is the root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of man and thing. My body casting aside and seizing another life comes at this sudden dark moment, this sudden awakening thought. Your life is truly in entering samadhi with an empty awakening; this is my original true face; hasten to protect it with true intention, beware slight negligence; like a man riding a thousand-li steed leaving dust behind, once seen with the eye, cannot delay; delay, and it is too late. Hence it is said, "Before is not, after is not. The moment of dew is but one breath; after one breath it is no longer seen." You must in stillness and concentration, if breathing is laboured, hasten to rise, gather this clear empty breath for the future. Sit thus once, surely one long gain. If truly no fail at its time, not out of measure, not waiting a hundred days, the base can be laid. These essentials, the ancients only said mysterious gate, never like my master truly pointed it in the human body. Know then that alchemical secrets concern功德 and nature and mind, not easy words. Zigong said, "The Master’s words on nature and the heavenly Way cannot be heard." From now on, the first task is to make the thoughts and ordinary breath die; so-called "die thoroughly, then faith can arise." Also I have heard you say, the luminous monk said, "You must refine at the time of breath falling." True enough. At this time ears do not hear, eyes do not see, all attachments are laid down, not a trace remains; from this leap forth, is it not the Great Way? Hence it is said, "From ignorance and unconsciousness seek the place of knowledge and consciousness." This saying is truly not false. If one cannot stop breath and die heart ordinarily, how can vital breath be greatly opened, so as to fill the world? For old men whose breath is exhausted and spirit daily withers, if not from this wondrous awakening cultivate, how can the four elements be solid and endure many years? Yet only knowing this orifice is master, but not knowing the circulation throughout the body, advancing fire and retreating symbols, harmonizing all bodily blood and qi, how can one endure long without death? The ancients said, "Old men’s blood and qi are dried up; unless the bamboo is struck, how can one be greatly awakened? Unless the qin is harmonized, how can the spirit endure long?" Therefore striking bamboo means stillness and unmoving, communication and enlightenment. Calling the turtle means bowing to others, surely with gain. As for drum and qin metaphor, when true Yang arrives, it beats away its gloom and harmonizes its blood and qi. You must from this hundred-foot pole step further; the Way is not far.

Anciently it was said, "Sages transmit fire but not medicine; transmit medicine but not fire." The talk of fire and time only means the exhaustion of internal and external breath. But to say breath is fire is not so. Breath is wind; fire is spirit. To fan the fire to form medicine is to use breath to move the spirit and form the elixir. Hence the ancients said, "Without fire the medicine does not transform; without wind the fire does not melt." Here can be seen fire and medicine. Again it is said, "Medicine is fire, fire is medicine." The name fire-medicine has no set meaning. When spirit and qi unite, the water and fire meet, and the great medicine arises amid it, rising misty and surging, that is called medicine; yet fire is within the medicine. When Heaven and Earth meet, dragon and tiger, metal and wood mix as one, gathering and drawing in the yellow court, without sound or odour, but holding one true intention, that is to warm and nurture by fire. Hence when refining it is called fire, fire which contains the medicine. Yet it is only movement and stillness. Movement with form, likened to medicine; stillness without form, likened to fire. This is perhaps nameless named, formless formed. You must know that fire and medicine are the one original true qi; as in the Doctrine of the Mean, "Heaven’s decree is called nature." Nature is here, fate is here, the Great Way is all here. The learner must imprint mind upon mind, that there may be gain. I also say what is external medicine and internal medicine? The internal medicine must have form; the external medicine can be gathered. Internal medicine is my body’s original qi. External medicine is the original qi in the great void; this neither increases nor diminishes, always present and free; but without internal illumination and internal nurturing with功, one cannot call back external medicine. Hence the Great Collection Scripture says, "The Buddha attains perfect enlightenment amid the two desires and the world of form," that is to use original spirit to silently illuminate the middle and lower fields; internal original Yang shines forth, external original qi surges vigorously, enveloping the whole body, utterly unaware of Heaven and Earth, man and self. This is probably internal and external united, stealing the spiritual Yang of Heaven and Earth to return to my form; long so, refining form and transforming qi, so-called "immortals have no other method, only that this qi fills the body inside and out." Knowing the true medicine, one still requires the true fire to refine it, "Using spirit to govern qi, qi returning to spirit, no other technique is needed for longevity." If there be separation here, spirit does not abide, then fire and medicine lose their pair and fall apart. Thus original spirit gathers original qi, like husband and wife, father and mother inseparable; separated, medicine does not unite, elixir does not form. Original spirit is emptiness; original qi is emptiness; to unite emptiness with emptiness is to unite emptiness with the Way; form and spirit both subtle, united with the Way and true. Only fear that human heart does not die, Way heart does not arise; all breath continues, embryo breath does not move, then cannot be one with Heaven, hard to gather the spiritual qi of Heaven and Earth. If talk of fire and time there is more, fire is spirit, time is breath; must use original spirit to move original breath, continuous and unbroken, firmly rooted and deeply grounded. This fire and time must be natural spiritual breath, like a newborn in the mother’s womb, breathing with the mother, no self master; this fire and true medicine, then no elixir fails. Think on this, the Great Way is not hard to seek.

### 6
The ancients said, "Fish leap and hawks fly; nowhere is not transformation’s realm. Water flows and flowers bloom; at all times is seen Heaven’s mechanism." If man can sweep clean his own heart, through the four seasons though there be wind and cloud, sun and rain differing, the scene is everywhere full of life and vigour—what need is there for sorrow or joy? Only pity that men know not the beauty present before them, but darkly are unaware; only a heart full of selfish desire, body and family encumbered, clothes and food piercing the heart; can there be no confusion that Heaven and man do not correspond? You scholars, at this springtime coming, after long rain first clearing, is there not a new scene? Know that this scene is the endless birth of life, the state of the return of Yang. Realizing this, one knows man’s Yang life and birth are so, not increasing nor decreasing. But at the start of practice, one must first sweep away all miscellaneous thoughts and dust, to have the sign of chaos, so-called non-action. Suddenly spirit and qi intertwine, the so-called "mysterious gate fire flares, dark and vast awakening," from non-action true message arises, thus medicine can be gathered. I see most of you at going to rest do not enter this chaotic realm to seek Yang qi, so empty gathering and empty refining see no gain; this is so. Hence it is said, "Gather medicine from nothingness, in the midst of confusion Yang qi arises." When Yang qi first arises, it is my body’s lesser Yang qi, to be paired with lesser Yin fire. Gathering at this point must be light and delicate, lest the medicine be lost; understand? From this, one breath and one exhalation, one going and one coming, long brewing; this brewing time is the chaos time. All things under Heaven would not sprout and bud unless shaded by Yin and moistened by rain; how much more the Way of elixir? Therefore after the first Yang, a Yin must be paired. When Yin shading is long, true Yang naturally ascends; I take it up and condense it in the mud pellet, again a moment of chaos, to make spirit and qi blend, forming one point of spiritual fluid. When the spiritual fluid descends, returns to the center yellow proper place, I warm and nurture it by natural fire, awaiting the qi machine to move again and further practice. Those who have worked this far have a real spiritual breath and sight; the breath of mouth and nose is utterly without movement; this is the time of great medicine about to be born. Hence it is said, "Form the elixir in emptiness." Within the vast dark, the spirit elixir is formed. When elixir is formed, nurture the embryo in emptiness, warmly and fluidly, naturally the embryo infant grows. If not by original qi nurturing original spirit, how can original spirit become full and strong? Without fullness and strength, all troubles and adversities stir it; because spirit is not strong but weak. Mencius nurtured the vast and firm qi, great and strong, filling Heaven and Earth; what matter could disturb it? Otherwise, sages are also men; how can they bear adversity and calamity, or face great dangers, always calm, never unable? How could they differ from men? Only that original qi changes to original spirit; at this time qi is spirit and spirit is qi, blended without division, so can be thus. What troubles learners is the desire for speed, adding hurried and violent qi; also when Yang is born, not knowing this is clear, pure one thing, but giving birth to one heart and one intention, thus mixing in post-heaven, even if sent to the furnace and sealed for nurturing, the embryo cannot be formed. The ancients said, "Old medicine cannot form elixir," that is mixing in post-heaven Yin consciousness; "Tender medicine cannot be taken," that is Yang qi yet not showing the surging rising misty sign, hastening to gather it by intention. Such fiery practice wastes not a little original spirit. Learners must be cautious at this.

### 7
Among the scenery of Heaven and Earth, the pleasing places are not really in the scenery but in the gain or loss of man’s heart. Therefore the same beautiful scene, the gentleman sees it as joy, the petty man as sorrow. For the gentleman’s heart is empty and spiritual, ever harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, and thus seeing each other he gains more. The petty man’s heart is selfish and dark, ever opposing creation and transformation, and thus facing the scene he feels sorrow. All depends on the heart’s own taking! You who study the Way, can you at all times and places have your own gain of joy? If truly you can, then in sun, rain, dark, and bright, all is no obstacle; you can endure riches, poverty, honour, disgrace, adversity, and trouble without being trapped. Though a small matter, yet from small can observe great. First you must have ability, then will not be troubled by rugged world roads. The ancient sages, though imprisoned in Youli, made the Zhou Yi; though exiled to Chen and Cai, played strings and sang; that is to hold a broad heart, having within a land of joy, hence nowhere is not a place to rejoice. You in this world must not say the sages can but I cannot. I have worked many years; though qi moves smoothly, I see no firm foundation because at the start I did not see the original true medicine, so confusedly gathered and refined, mixed in dregs; long so, like kiln bricks mixed with impurity, all labour with no success. I think of you, who have a good heart for the Way; now I open it to you. Otherwise, you will be old, and having gone the wrong way, returning to root and origin and returning to life will be difficult. Generally in sitting, first lay down all attachments, not a thread hanging on; that is to place this body in the land of nothing; I also do not perceive form. Holding this one thought is a return to truth. When there is mingling and confusion, no one and no self, no where and no Heaven—this is nature. Nature is benevolence. If I have awakening, this is true seeing of nature. From this true nature arises original spirit, that is true heart. To illuminate the heart and see nature, how difficult? Refine and call it elixir; elixir is original nature; but must have true intention as master, then only is it mine. True intention is true heart. Having this true nature is to have root; getting this true heart is to have use. Otherwise blind practice and blind refining, even if later attaining, is not worthy of the immortal’s esteem. After seeing nature, one spirit bright, all phenomena empty; then my body surging, misty, original pure essence qi circulates inside and out, up and down, coming and going; this is using original spirit to refine great medicine. Thus gather, thus cook; then not post-heaven spirit and qi, nor wasted effort. Generally seeing nature once, original qi moves once; really cultivating for one or two years, elixir base can be firm, becoming a long-living immortal. The start must be earnest on the two words nature and life; what is immortal, what is ordinary, that one can gather original, cook once, become original Great Way. If mixed with post-heaven, like planting good seedlings with wild grass, how can good fruit be had? Yet nature as a thing is so easy to see; why are those who attain the Way so few? Because seeing nature is at one time, refining nature is lifelong. Only by taking original nature as root, holding it always, naturally day by day month by month, there arises gathering of brightness. At first seeing nature is but one awakening in chaos, not clear on all sides. It must be nurtured long; my original qi and great void qi without gap, then this state. Again it is said, "The human body is wholly one qi with Heaven and Earth; except for self, all is Heaven." How far is Heaven! To reach this state, the heart must be empty of things; nature empty like water, till forgetting things, forgetting men, forgetting self, then can there be this great harmony one qi. The learner wishing to be of one body with the great void must not have internal thoughts arise, nor external thoughts enter; then breathing in and out all become light, feeling self has only one point of spirit light. The so-called "Primordial reveals one precious pearl in the void," also called "one bright pearl never departs," also called "refined into one Muni precious pearl," though named differently, all mean one spirit manifesting form, always responding always still. If not gathering the original one point of gold in water, slowly refining spiritual fire, forcing it to rise and fall, gathering back into the five bright palaces, how can such a precious pearl be formed? This is seeing nature brought to its utmost, when original nature becomes dharma body. What my master today says truly points out the original nature’s beginning and end, form and image. You who understand this, not bound to my master’s words, nor departing from my master’s instructions, each recognize it on body and mind, then truly have it.

Man lives in this world many years; if not early and quick to cultivate and return to original Heaven, once entering the dark path, one does not know to what road one falls. To be ghost, to be demon, to be bird, to be beast—this is sorrowful. Careful thought, how much better to cultivate virtue and understand the Way. Though cultivation is a beautiful matter of life, alas mundane dust rolls and rolls, losing original nature and Heaven, without true master’s instruction, how can one know to walk the Way and not lose the correct? Hence for many years there are those who study the Way, but at the end have no gain; others who toil all life, but later enter side paths; others who cultivate and prove by themselves, without master’s transmission, blindly refining and harming nature and life; still others visit teachers and friends, spend money lavishly, pleased with themselves, but ultimately deceived. Fortunate now that you upon entering the gate do not fall into heresy or evil sects; this is a great blessing. Encountering but not refining, refining but not diligent, is to fail good affinities of past lives; afterwards it is hard to meet again. I have worked many years; the turning of the river wheel no longer by morning and evening; why do I see no foundation formed? It is because at the start one did not obtain true clear medicine, so mixing desires and delusions, leaving it to accumulate day by day, month by month, like kiln bricks mixed with impurity; in the end labour but no accomplishment. Now I show you: day and night work must first fix one time, extinguish the spirit of knowledge, wipe out thoughts of thinking, sit like a mountain, heart still like water. Thus purified, indeed body and mind at peace, breath calm; then slightly close eyes, condense spirit and mind, regulate breath, let it be natural, one going and one coming, one opening and one closing; exhale without coarseness, inhale without hurry; long so, no going in or out, calm and at ease, abiding in the middle palace—that is ordinary breath stopping. When ordinary breath stops, embryo breath appears. Slowly nurture so; naturally true qi surges, reaching the heart mansion; this is opening orifices. For true qi is strong, rushing straight to the red palace; hopefully even hair orifices will open in time. So-called "one orifice communicating, all orifices bright," also said "one root returned to origin, six roots become liberated." When you work thus far, you may first from the vulnerable orifice rise upward, then proceed to the tail flow, directly up to the mud pellet palace. If only qi mechanism slightly moves, or only rushes heart mansion, not seeing the seven orifices widely open, nor all the hair eyes open, this is not true opening of orifices; do not rashly turn the river wheel. Moreover without water moving fire, the whole body will burn. Must have this scene; then there is internal truth and external response, external feeling and internal spirit; my body’s qi united with great void original qi as one; the so-called true medicine. Also called man stealing Heaven and Earth’s qi to form elixir. If you have true medicine arising, circulating inside and out, then many years of stagnant Yin qi will transform into sweat, flowing out of hair eyes; all pollution and dirt melt away; my body’s qi nature changes, gradually approaching sages and worthies. I again show you: previous work long, previous road familiar, at times cannot be abandoned; may gather my original spirit into the mysterious orifice, apparently without knowledge or feeling, like a foolish man; really the heart is dead but spirit not dead. This is ancient foundation laid; only because mixing sand with soil, starting with impurity, at last cannot be firm and enduring; so must throw away previous work entirely, returning to the vast Heaven, to sift impurities and private dregs. This also one method; you may decide. I observe in this world learners, some only know to refine essence, some only to breathe deeply, some only to refine spirit. One section of practice is not without use; but to preserve flesh and blood body and release Yin consciousness spirit is not the Great Way. There are also who speak of void and Great Way, laying down all attachments, not a speck of dust; yet laying down still raising, not staining still greatly staining. Not only non-action teachings have much thus, even among my disciples there is this fault. Only you perceive this; thus my master delights to instruct. Generally to cultivate the Way, must nurture the spiritual original spirit to nourish the emptiness original qi. This original qi is neither essence nor qi nor spirit; yet also is essence and qi and spirit; it is the union of essence, qi, and spirit as one. Man requires to cultivate the Great Way and form golden body; without this true empty original qi cannot. Yet to know it is still hard, much less to hold it? In sum cultivating Great Elixir is no chance matter; not without root and capacity can it be met. Now do not be self-satisfied; must accumulate much Yin功. Where is Yin功? Only by my Great Way meeting those with affinity and virtue, widely opening and enlightening; great功 is in this.

Now seeing you calmly nurture, many have heart of Heaven returning, yet no one succeeds; why? Because though the origin be clear, nurturing not long, reason and desire alternate, cannot reach the state of clear peace and freedom. Now I tell you, after thoroughly seeing the origin, constantly rouse and awaken, like Master Ruiyan often calling himself, "Master, are you alert?" And answering, "Alert." Such arranging of spirit and strength, striving with exertion, how can it not be constant as one day for life? Recently I do not blame wall-facing nurturing to remove sleep demon’s toil; yet when hungry eat, when tired nap, still must often rouse; once drowsy, sleep; once awake, hold; do not permit deep sleep, long sleep without waking. Every action and movement, keep this in mind; one still and silent, hold without losing; then Way fruit will have its ripening time. I once said, "Yanzi got one good, and held it close to his breast; what spirit is this?" To get one good is to penetrate the original person. To hold close is to, after penetrating the origin, always rouse and awaken, not allowing any dullness, lest the original person be confused by it. You scholars have this understanding, always uninterrupted, moment to moment not violating; naturally heart and principle blend, principle and heart harmonize, like mother and child clinging and unwilling to part. The Book says, "Thinking of this is in this; letting go of this is in this," this is the sign of medicine maturing and elixir forming, when such a scene begins. Duke Zhou sat waiting for dawn, night following day; is this not the meaning? Yet at the start, it is most necessary to firmly fix clear true medicine. Essence is not the essence of intercourse, but a cluster of spiritual water in the lotus pool. The Great Cave Scripture says, "The lotus pool’s spiritual water melts, spring water flows to moisten, circulating endlessly." But where is this born? When does it move? This is not casual. The beginner in sitting excludes illusions, gathers spirit, sits lightly, suddenly spirit enters the dark place, swiftly awakening; at this time I observe whether the Yin channel pulse moves; if it moves, I gather back to the void; if no movement, also gather back to the void; this is essence arising. I observe your qi mechanism differs, nature varied; some move, some do not; all must first remember clarity, mysterious gate fire flares, dark and vast awakening; even if no movement, essence arises. Essence arising is Yang arising; this is the true basis. Qi is not breath; it is ordinary breath stopping, true breath moving, filling the whole body inside and out, possessing the form of strength, centrality, purity, governing pre- and post-heaven breathing, circulating inside and out Yin and Yang; perhaps known but not seen. Yet when does it move? Where is it exercised? When water and fire meet, ordinary breath stops; this qi then communicates with Heaven and Earth; this is the sign of qi arising, rising from the spring upwards, beginning at the ten fingers, gradually circulating the whole body; just as Heaven and Earth’s qi mechanism moves unceasingly. If there be one place paused, it is a dead thing, a sick mechanism, not lively and active and fluent without hindrance. Spirit is not the thinking spirit, but the true spirit arising suddenly after chaos with no knowledge or consciousness. I govern this, not permitting wandering thoughts or fantasies to mix therein; only one heart without two hearts; only one thought without two thoughts; this is original spirit acting, consciousness spirit withdrawn and listening. In sum, spirit and qi are both the Heaven and Earth Yin and Yang that join with me. Qian is Yang; Yang gives me nature; nature is lodged in the heart, and manifests as spirit, which illumines all and knows all. Kun is Yin; Yin gives me fate; fate is lodged in the body, and manifests as qi, which at no time stops moving and at no place is not filled. This original nature and fate and spirit and qi are the foundation; yet not my real alchemical skill, nor true master of cultivation. For this nature and fate and spirit and qi are like the one movement of the mysterious gate, as the Great Ultimate opens the foundation, dividing into Yin and Yang; applied to human body these are nature and fate, spirit and qi; still one and two. If one wants true elixir root, must at the time before Great Ultimate moves, in vast dark and vague great harmony qi, neither nature nor fate, yet nature and fate; beyond speech and thought. You have now thoroughly seen the source; I no longer labor my lips.

### 10
My master’s elixir returns gold and liquid, freeing from the suffering of reincarnation; you are yet on the halfway, hurry to cultivate, directly realize supreme Bodhi; perhaps the dharma image will always remain, never driven by ghosts and spirits, falling into the three paths and six destinies. Otherwise, hard it is. Do not say you later disciples have not attained great return; even since Tang and Song times there are many immortals who merely returned jade liquid, not finished golden elixir; when good fortune is exhausted, karmic retribution follows. It seems man not attaining golden immortal is like ordinary man, only bad karma less, not entering ox’s belly horse’s gut to suffer pains among pains. You scholars, take this great assembly’s broad opening, the teaching seat grandly spread, Heaven’s high immortals do not bind by small faults, nor restrain by rank; only those with will to enter the Way are none who do not fulfill their heart’s wishes. Only pity is: encountering but not refining, then cannot avoid the field of suffering. You should now exert your strength to uphold the Way, not to be the second person of ancient or modern times; set such great ambition, the immortals and sages delight to assist and not weary. Before the assembly opens this year, those seeking the Way wishing to gain true master’s transmission, not by thousands of li or exhausting heart and strength can they reach the highest truth for liberation. Now you do not go out of the courtyard, nor spend effort, yet obtain my master’s transmission of mystery; why not so? Why not rejoice so? Compared to when I first gained master’s instruction, all ten parts easily obtained; and if thus not practiced, I fear immortal affinities disperse, hard to meet again. You scholars strive. Today again I point out the key to cultivation. The Way is the Great Ultimate. The heart is like Yin and Yang. Spirit and soul and essence and intent are like the five elements. This Way hangs in great space, not yet fallen upon the body. The principle of infinite Great Ultimate, the essence of Yin and Yang and the five elements, all mingled and confused, vast and boundless, united as one region—what five elements? What Yin and Yang? What Great Ultimate? One emptiness only, one true emptiness only. Once perceived and moved, once touched and arisen, then most wondrous, most subtle, most spiritual and divine, and creates all things endlessly; most wondrous and unending change. When fallen upon the human body, becoming flesh and blood, qi and nature changing, desires tainting, the five elements not true, two breaths not original, so the Great Ultimate is concealed and unseen. Cultivating the Way is nothing else but to teach man to remove the stains that never were, to return to the original good. At the start, firmly recognize your own Great Ultimate; Great Ultimate is original person. Fix this, with one point of wisdom to illuminate it; as Bodhidharma said, "Pure knowledge, wondrous and perfect, its nature is empty and still." This is in ignorance without consciousness, suddenly there is knowing and consciousness; this is pure knowledge, wondrous perfect, original person. Hence it is said, "This one awakening, no other thing, is to perceive emptiness by emptiness." We have in chaos this awakening; hasten to gather true thought, use my true intention. Though this intention is masterful and active, still but one heart without two; still the original intention; not far from the Way. By this mating of water and fire, combining metal and wood, long nurturing, the spirit and soul and essence and intent stored in the liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney, all united as original true Yin and Yang, so-called return to the great uncarved block, return to the great beginning; still the original unborn complete mass of original qi. Such is near the Way. The human body has also important places, like the mountain root and mysterious breast two orifices, all important passages for qi and essence circulation. If one can keep the thought on the mountain root, true qi will naturally move up and down, returning to the old place of the yellow court. If one can observe the mysterious breast, true fluid will naturally be gathered and raised. Each time you practice, these two orifices may not be neglected. The ancients said, "Mysterious breast is the qi tube receiving the essence talisman," again, "Mysterious breast one orifice is the shore of life and death," again, "Mountain root is man’s initial life knot." We open the governor and conception vessels, allowing the passage of qi; this is this orifice; if spirit can abide here, one may live long without aging, avoid sickness and lengthen years.

### 11
I see you have cleared the river wheel path; now no need to use the river wheel to circulate the body to irrigate the elixir field; you must be full of essence and qi, but there is danger of overflow. Hence the Yi says, "When the sun reaches mid-heaven it declines; when the moon is full it wanes." Even Heaven and Earth so; much more man! The ancients transmitted the great circuit method; none like the elixir scriptures say, "Ask my son at what time? It is but the time of medicine arising." This medicine arises without breath to be found; suddenly water and fire meet; "In the crescent furnace the jade flower arises." This is the sign of true medicine arising. At this I seek the great beginning original qi as head; with original year, month, day, and hour, begin great work; then Heaven opens the yellow way, a most propitious moment. Such medicine is not mixed with post-heaven dregs. What is the state of midday retreat of Yin symbols? The ancients said, "Ask me when is noon? It is but medicine morning at the golden palace." How to know it is morning at the golden palace and mud pellet? It must be at the time of advancing fire, gently using post-heaven breath to urge the original qi up to Kunlun peak. Though not seeing silver waves overwhelming sky, golden crystals pouring on the head, hundred vessels trembling, nine palaces penetrating thoroughly, yet medicine qi leads upward, whole body leaps, qi mechanism turns and winds, no hair or orifice untouched; faintly feeling body stands like a wall, mind like clear deep pool. This is the time of great Yang flourishing; just the starting of Yin symbols; so Yang extreme gives birth to Yin; this is the meaning. When you work to this, you must retreat downward, not still use urging force. If again advancing fire, sure to scatter the original qi outside, unable to gather into the five bright palaces for elixir base; this is empty motion, what profit? Again it is said, "Ask me when is Mao? The red child fire cloud cave array. Without the savior Avalokitesvara, the great medicine surely bursts." Therefore Mao gate must be bathed. With qi mechanism circulating throughout the body, if not original true fire all is post-heaven phase fire. If thought too heavy, breath too tight, like summer and autumn sun, man cannot endure; hence the metaphor of red child phase fire. At this time must retreat fire and stop symbols, one heart fully enlightened, no thinking east or west suffices. Hence it is said, "Without savior Avalokitesvara, the great medicine surely bursts." Avalokitesvara is metaphor for great compassion and mercy, ever sprinkling sweet dew from the purified vase, relieving human troubles. At this time must also produce a heart of mercy and kindness, free from vexing heat trouble. Again it is said, "Ask me when is You? It is the meeting of conception and governor vessels. At this time if no yellow robe, how can medicine be supremely auspicious?" You bathing means breath retreats to the red palace. At this time the later governor and earlier conception vessels meet and gather in one place. How to know it is the red palace? The red palace is where spirit and qi gather, about to be full, sweet fluid dripping, one path with sound. At this time the three treasures meet in the red palace, and the burning fire seems like burning; I only hold the idea of harmony and protection, and the breath’s ups and downs follow naturally; that is retreating Yang fire and stopping Yin symbols. Stop a moment, then gather back to the Dipper mansion, warm and nurture it; this is the great harmony original qi. When learners work to this, gather medicine qi back into the furnace, consciousness unceasing; long so the spiritual light flashes, shining at the central northern ocean boundary of Wu and Ji, like the long hanging sun and moon; this is my original spirit transformed into the mysterious pearl. Hence it is said, "Water bottom mysterious pearl," also said, "Earth within yellow sprout." All mean your own original spirit transformed into true intention; at this gathering time, true intention again transforms into original spirit; returning to original one yuan of principle and qi, pure without flaw, perfect to goodness. Each time you sit, you also feel this original spirit, at ease and elegant. Qi mechanism moves, but it does not move; qi mechanism rests, but it does not rest; this is original true person manifestation. Seeing this is seeing nature; knowing this is illuminating heart. Having this awakening of understanding, the foundation of great awakening golden immortal is here. You have thoroughly understood this; indeed have this thing; be cautious, do not be arrogant.

### 12
Life in this world, except cultivating the Way, all enjoy endless glory and splendor, all are false words, empty achievements. Only by great awakening can one be happy for thousands of years; compared to the voice of the world, greater or lesser, who gains and who loses is like the divide between Heaven and Abyss. Yet such is an encounter once in a thousand years. You scholars fortunate to meet this good assembly, hurry to cultivate; is it not a hundred thousand times better than worldly riches and honours? Yet some find it hard, thinking this matter, even encountering good affinity and prior root, cannot be attained in three or five years; the world has those who cultivate lifelong with no gain, others who have labored many kalpas without success; how like worldly riches and honours which can be obtained and lost at will? Little knowing those with will surely succeed; Heaven does not disappoint the diligent; only fear is men without will or without whole heart and effort; how can cultivation be attained but Way not obtained? The reason slow to gain is seeing but not practicing, practicing but not exerting, drifting and lazy, sweetly abandoning oneself. If one can advance with one strength, like the hungry desiring food, the thirsty seeking drink, single-hearted and focused, gathering qi and spirit, how can there not be success? The ancients said, "Toil for two or three years, joy for thousands of years." Such are the words of the sages; are they deceit to cheat men? Confucius said, "I desire benevolence, then benevolence has arrived." With what I have and cultivate myself, unlike power and fame controlled by Heaven and I cannot manage. These words truly exhaust the learner's beginning; can one not be diligent? Now I see you with gain of body and mind; take this chance to taste its flavour, then add fierce boiling and urgent refining, and put forth a spirit of detachment and peace; not waiting three or five years, but within this one year naturally great effect will appear. Even if no grudge from past or present life, still one must accumulate much Yin功 to dispel sin debts; perhaps at one stroke succeed, not suffer demonic entanglement or disaster. Moreover if there is progress in this work, one should especially perform the rituals of the Dipper and exorcise stars, invite immortals and sages to witness and make covenant, to dispel demons and break obstacles on behalf, so that cultivation proceeds steadily. This has always been the foremost task of true cultivators. You scholars do not seek quick success. Know that those who hasten are not great vessels; those who advance rashly have no great功. Better to nurture spirit and qi, extremely strong and correct, purely by essence; then perform the returning seven-day heavenly mechanism; no fear of failure. Also spirit must be nurtured extremely purely, qi nurtured extremely purely; at this time, not returning jade liquid elixir seems useless; know that after nurturing purely, returning golden liquid elixir is easier; no need nine or ten years’ toil, can ascend to Great Luo. Think on this, is it not so? Alas, modern learners only know to guard the center; this is the mind method of sages in all ages. First guard the form, then guard the formless; then can become immortal and sage. Yet to guard the center and get medicine is only half the study; even if Yang arises, only solitary Yang; without Yin mercury to match it, still cannot form the immortal embryo; for having male without female, no way to mate and produce immortals. Especially must know the method of gathering; if medicine does not rise, medicine ages and qi scatters; must obtain a new sprout of medicine, gather and take it, to circulate the river wheel; this is no other method. Observe from the thirtieth to the first and second days, all signs of darkness, without light; this is the sign of no medicine but slight medicine. When it comes to the third day, the moon appears at the Geng direction, a crescent moon shows at the sky’s edge, only a line of light; the medicine’s newness and tenderness is like this. Hence it is said, "Someone asked me about cultivating mystery, pointing far to the edge of the sky, a line on the moon." This shows the movement of one Yang; though slight, it is greatly promising; must carefully explore. In sum, medicine arising is not difficult; must have original spirit to steer it; you scholars must know the true spirit arises as true intention to be master; then can from slight become great, not disturbed and scattered by post-heaven knowledge spirit. This is the essential secret. Why? Spirit clear then qi clear; spirit turbid then qi turbid; a fixed principle. As for extracting and adding method, extract Yang from Kan, add Yin from Li. Yang is lead; lead is qi. Yin is mercury; mercury is liquid. Though qi above is cloud, cloud below is rain; rain transforms to qi and becomes cloud rising; cloud transforms to rain and falls; qi produces liquid, liquid produces qi; qi and liquid co-generate, condense in one place; with spiritual fire refining, it becomes the wondrous medicine. But at the start of work, one Yang first moves; the ancients likened "earth thunder shaking mountain top rain," teaching one to be like thunder’s sudden sound, sudden awakening, that is the mysterious gate orifice opening. Hence it is said, "In stillness Yang moves metal Li mine; underground thunder roars, fire pushes metal." This is Heaven and Man jointly arising. What is Heaven and Man jointly arising? From ignorance and unconsciousness, it is pure Heaven unmingled with Man; suddenly there is knowledge and consciousness, it is pure Man yet not separated from Heaven; therefore it is called Heaven and Man jointly arising. Such Heaven and Man united is true Yang, can be the Mother of the Elixir. Have you scholars probed this?

### 13
You who have worked long, have lost many troubles, worries, illnesses, pains, and itches. Even these slight small retributions, think on it, it is the highest rank of immortals in the world. How much more from this to cultivate, there is higher than highest, profound and profound again, the immortals of all ages, enjoying freedom and ease. Think on this, which is great, which small? Surely follow the great and be great men; do not fall among small men. But this matter concerns Heaven’s decree; not those without affinity, virtue, blessing or root can bear it. Therefore alchemical Way is not lightly transmitted; only those with immortal affinity and Way root may meet and know, know and act. Otherwise, even if fortunate to hear the orthodox teaching at a dharma assembly, still demonic entanglement and disaster not avoided. Even those with virtue and root of soil, Heaven tests many ways to see if their heart and nature are firm and loyal. As for external invasions, all are due to my past and present lives’ deeds, to be repaid; no thought to blame Heaven or others. If in my family there is disorder, also such karmic affinity was long tied; is it not fate? "Follow and bear that which is justly due," Mencius’ words can be pondered. If cultivating also without trials but self-inspiring, the more trials the stronger; even if unforeseen matters occur, accept and bear them; naturally no trouble.

### 14
I show the river wheel method; among it there are parts not carefully explained. Heaven and Man secretly unite; one Yang first moves, medicine first arises; with such appearance; body and mind tranquil, focused breath gentle; first condensation of elixir is also this state; all must be gentle, harmonious, silent, still. Why? Yang must be paired with Yin; if one uses rigidity and movement, it is male paired with male; how can there be transformation? Also if heart and spirit do not return to the uncarved block, one clear, bright, penetrating light, spirit scatters wandering outside, not mingling with qi; this is why softness of heart is used. The Supreme says, "Blunt sharpness and untangle confusion; harmonize light and mingle with dust," can be silently understood. Yet at the first arising of true Yang, only light gentle gathering and raising; ancient words, "Two parts of new tender water, paired with two parts fire." When rising and reaching the back and spine, at this time qi mechanism surges, slightly conflicting; yet no harm if thought is focused tightly. In sum, the river wheel is like Heaven and Earth’s year of creation. From winter solstice the Yin all congeals and closes, one Yang first moves and fire arises. Consider, how is this Yang? When three Yang open and thrive, how is it? When six Yang are reached, great heat of the season, then how? From this time of Yang flourishing, suddenly a Yin arises, gradually autumn cools, then severe winter cold. Advancing and retreating return to furnace; all must observe Heaven’s Way and carry out Heaven’s course, to accord with the law. Otherwise river wheel method and elixir scriptures say there is great danger; not following Heaven’s Way in practice will surely bring many misfortunes and little good. Think on this, river wheel is no difficult matter. If true Yang is not greatly moving, then quietly nurture for long, in the twelve hours uninterruptedly; naturally qi is full and medicine arises; no need three or two months. In sum, the Way is one only; one is emptiness only. The Scripture of Pure Stillness says, "Look inward at the heart, heart without heart; look outward at the body, body without body." Students sitting guarding the center, must see the blood and flesh body and heart as empty and hollow; only condense spirit in emptiness, unite qi in stillness. Emptiness and stillness means spirit and qi blend as one, return to original chaos one qi; this is true medicine, this is spiritual elixir; no other thing to be medicine or elixir. Hence it is said, "Man must externalize his body yet the body remains; empty his heart yet the heart is present." Learners only need heart without attachment, confused and chaotic; naturally wont to accord with the Way truly. This is gathering; also refining. The so-called "gathering without gathering is better than gathering; refining without refining is better than refining" is this. If truly so empty, all attachments release, whole body naturally preserved; this body naturally pure; this heart naturally spiritual. Because it is empty and without thing, all things in Heaven and Earth are within my capacity. The Way of union of Heaven and Man is only this emptiness. You who have not used river wheel, may take it as emptiness; not clinging to form nor to emptiness; this suffices.

### 15
My master often says at the start of receiving body and qi, you scholars have not yet fully understood; now I explain more clearly. Before man is born, this qi mingles in vast silence, like the great void; from the moment a thought arises, unknowingly, this qi falls between father’s essence and mother’s blood. Yet at this time only essence and blood in a mass, no form or limbs; where then am I? At this time one point of original Yang true qi fills essence and blood; thus daily nourished and cultivated, gradually full and growing, like the shape of a chicken egg, then there is a cavity; my original qi attaches within the cavity; thus below arise two kidneys, above one heart; heart and kidneys are distant about eight inches; and original qi is rolling and flowing therein. Later arise the governor vessel at the back, conception vessel at the front, and the five senses and hundred joints gradually complete. All original qi lies hidden in the cavity, then only forms the body; within there is perception spirit and manifestation of spirit brightness. Later those who wish to cultivate golden elixir to become golden immortals, how can they be outside this cavity and seek elsewhere? Hence it is said, "The heart must be in the cavity; thoughts not to arise but always hold the gate." My Way teaches man to illuminate heart light and eye light on the elixir field; this is the orthodox method of thousands of true and myriad saints returning to root and origin, returning to life and root, drop by drop returning to origin. You scholars now know original person; I now specially show the place where original person dwells. Nurturing long, in the elixir field feels a cluster of misty, surging, harmonious, lively qi; within this original person appears. The Supreme says, "Vague and indistinct, within there is a thing." The thing is qi, qi is Yang. "Dim and obscure, within there is essence;" essence is essence clear and not dark, alert and not confused. Not common essence, not clear essence, probably so-called "heart essence operating alone." "Its essence is very true; within there is faith." Faith not among side-door words Yang life child and external kidney movement, there is a note of faith arriving; it means this essence is purely essence of essence; my heart must have one segment of utmost sincerity and no delusion, firmly believing birth and death is small, nature and life great; let all things come in profusion, I have a place of rest, and the original person is not moved or coloured by it. This is the return to the true of no limit. From now on you must at the first thought’s arising, if truly Heaven’s good heart appears, there is a true interest; I must receive it in the midst, hide it deeply; as the Yi says, "Wash heart and retire, hide in secrecy." Should you suddenly turn light and see, suddenly feel the elixir field’s up and down flowing, circulating unceasingly, lively and fluent, I also hold and nurture it, striving that this qi daily increases and monthly flourishes. Hence it is said, "Immortals and Daoists are not spirits, but accumulate essence and gather qi to become true." This is the subtle work of accumulating essence and gathering qi. As for preserving body and nurturing heart and nature, all arises from this. I fear matters and things’ encumbrances hinder cultivation; know that now life matters are all karmic ties from previous lives; need not cling to heart; let them be; naturally it is well. You only practice work normally, using essence and qi flow as main; emptiness and non-attachment as function, then everywhere is my original person’s manifestation. Do you know this? Why then cling to ancestral whip?

### 16
The ancients said, "Ultimate emptiness, ultimate nothingness, suddenly penetrate the origin, yet still nurture it with emptiness and nothingness," not raising one thought, not joining one vision, wholly like ignorance of a fool, not feeling pain when beaten, not feeling hatred when cursed; this is to be a person of the Way. Hence the ancients said, "To learn to be a fool is to be wise." But not like the world’s fools, whose spirit mechanism is blocked, without any lively and fluent manifestation. My so-called fool is but an emptiness luminous spirit, letting original nature and Heaven be; not like common men left thinking and seeking, planning each thing on body and family; not knowing Heaven has decreed, utterly unable to control it, wasting mind and heart. Rather than regret, hasten to act benevolence. But how to act benevolence? Confucius said, "I want benevolence, then benevolence arrives." How can it be otherwise? Yet at the start, must especially clearly recognize the original person daily, nurture the original person vast and great; then have strength. Though there be movement and stillness, all flowing and circulating Heaven’s principle, yet never different; so keep position and go, no obstruction. If you can always illuminate and arrange spirit light, all return to chaos Heaven, entirely empty of man and self, that is the body of no limit. When it moves, all things clear and distinct before you; all are contained within me; then see the use of no limit and Great Ultimate. Though you may not be able to fully use all functions, when Heaven’s principle returns and you glance to see emptiness and light, do not take it as joy. For joy is Yang, sorrow is Yin, Yin and Yang opposing, alternating and cycling. When working to this, must lay down all, forget the eight consciousnesses, thoroughly forget, then complete the principle of Great Ultimate. When circulating to the cauldron, form it into elixir; that is true immortal skill. If at this there be discrimination, love and hate, not only does it add a demon obstacle to the Way, even if by chance the elixir forms, must start again the work of returning to emptiness. If you can as I teach, when once attained do not move thought, naturally and spontaneously, one with great void, no need other days sitting nor wasting much effort; know or not? Some are joyful when quiet, vexed when noisy. Do you know at noisy time, when voices roar, things entangle, this qi has already moved? Rather than vigorously fight the noise, better to vigorously cultivate stillness. The ancients said, "When one meets noise, well then apply strength to turn back." Now illuminate and suddenly awaken, breaking open the message within; better than sitting on bamboo chair and straw mat hundreds of thousands of millions of times. Can you surely see and be sure? Try from tonight, whenever others are noisy, whether it concerns me or not, I always strengthen and harden, like refined steel a hundred times, not changing colour a little. The strength gained here exceeds that in quiet places stretched and prolonged. I again show you: working to this, not like formerly mind and body with no handle. In all actions and social intercourse, always use one awakening heart, feel that I have my own body unbroken for thousands of years; all outside things are but illusions, why care for their weight? Not only external things, even this body is a puppet in the arena; when I am here I can speak and act; when I leave, it falls apart; why care to rely on it? Only the original qi, birth and death together, movement and stillness not parted; in extreme confusion and upheaval no change or increase; I only always hold and cling to it, closely and firmly; empty of dust and dirt; naturally it scatters and dissolves, sheds the shell and goes, becoming a free and untroubled great man. This is but years’ work; its accomplishment, from ancient till now unchanging, transcending Heaven and Earth and existing alone. Compared to a hundred years’ life, a few years’ splendour, which is great and which is small? You can judge. Alas! The assembly is not often, the Way seat is hard to come again; I have struck the bell on this mountain for more than ten years; fortunately you have obtained some samadhi; surely teaching another year much may be seen. Do not waste this good time.

### 17
The Way of nurturing is but one Yang. Yang’s first arising is born after Yin is extreme; like today the Yin mists close in, not seeing the transforming sun and sky; must slowly blow and nurture long; suddenly ordinary Yin cannot withstand true Yang, like midnight at the first hour, sea clouds and mists vast; like the rising sun brightening, breaking through layers of Yin, showing true Yang face; unaware of colour or sound, bitter and fiery, greatly manifesting radiance. Yet this true Yang greatly manifesting is not by today’s one stillness; must be long nurtured, often concealed and hidden, stored long, then gradually accumulated, then gradually it rises in light. The supreme Yang is glorious in the supreme Yin’s solemnity; life force is in breath mechanism, vitality in breath qi; this is the unchanging Way of Heaven, Earth, and man. Do not cultivate stillness without seeing the face of Qian and hastily go to rest. Know that the Way of Heaven and Earth, the nature of all things, if not nurtured will not gestate; if not accumulated will not form. Day and night breathe and nurture spirit; though no movement of intention, no lump of vitality, yet the mechanism begins here; its source begins here. At the time of quiet nurturing, this is Yang’s arising; only at first practice, no great manifestation. Your recent qi mechanism has moving and unmoving; know that moving is foundation, not supreme wonder. Know that there is no bottom; to advance one stage, another stage beckons. If you can work without cease, study without slack, long so, then essence comes forth; long so, spirit and wonder arise; so-called "the longer the more fragrant" is this. Generally when working reaches tastelessness, the taste must come from here. Heaven as Heaven, if Yin not extreme, Yang cannot arise. When things are exhausted, the Way reverses; Heaven and Earth’s principle, not exhausted no change; not long no transformation. The poem says, "Mountains exhausted and rivers run dry, doubt no road; willows dark and flowers bright, another village." Again, "When one works, all sides black, no road to enter, then one enters." In sum, great doubt means great enlightenment; small doubt means small enlightenment; no doubt means no enlightenment. My master has looked around and seen disciples working long; only at the early stage of Yin extreme giving birth to Yang; Yin excites true Yang to move; suddenly Yin and Yang contend, neither yielding; great obstruction; thus some say I have no root or capacity, cannot enter the Way, and at once think to retreat. Some at the start seek results, thus meet demonic disturbance. All are due to wish power not strong, cultivation not firm, seeing Way unclear, believing Way not true. You endure hardship, thus have this wonder. As for spirit and qi partly mingled, there is partly chaos; fully mingled, there is full chaos. This is perhaps the sign of ordinary breath dying, true breath arising, ordinary heart dying, Way heart arising. With such chaotic appearance, then verify my spirit qi mingling and Great Ultimate truly returning. When spirit and qi fully mingle, naturally vast and boundless; outside unaware of man and Heaven, inside unaware of spirit and qi; like rising in cloud and mist, no impurity between; eventually mingling with Heaven, Earth, and man to become one qi. This is "attain harmony and balance, Heaven and Earth placed and all things nurtured." You who work, must reach this state; then truly the face of Qian and Yuan appears, filling Heaven and Earth high and low, without limit or concealment. From here further nurture and further refining, strive to transform all body’s Yin into qi, all body’s qi into spirit; this is hundreds of billions of dharma bodies, without end. Though you not yet here, the dharma body is stored; in future this grand sight will be. Must accumulate long before completing; do not seek quick success.

I teach you the method of gathering brightness. What is brightness? The mind’s brightness arises from eyes; heart light and eye light strike each other, continuing unceasingly; naturally the chest is vast and broad, no thing disturbs my heart, occupies my spirit mansion. Long nurturing, one piece of spirit light shines universally, like the sun and moon in the sky, no detail not manifest. Only fear one thought’s brightness is undone by one thought’s recklessness, so brightness is not constant. Like nurturing the eye, must guard against wind and cold outside, nurture spirit and qi inside, not allowing one speck of dust between; then eyes naturally long bright, seeing mountains, rivers, and people, none not known. If daily not well nurtured, then eyes dark and spirit dim; though good and bad, beauty and ugliness manifest, cannot distinguish. Man’s nurturing of mind is no different. The heart is not the lump of flesh and blood; inside is the most empty and spiritual. Mencius said nurturing the heart is in few desires; but in the chapters "Niushan" and "Moving Heart," one stores the night breath in the early morning; one gathers righteousness to produce vast breath; why emphasize qi and neglect heart? For heart is spirit of qi; qi is aid to heart. If man can keep qi unmoving, spirit naturally tranquil. Spirit tranquil, heart naturally peaceful. Therefore not called nurturing heart, but nurturing qi; this is the great secret of nurturing qi not heart. If not deeply nourishing qi, but only eagerly seeking heart, many fail to find heart’s peace all day long. Look at fish; heart is fish, qi is water; fish finds water and is at ease; heart finds qi and is nurtured; a fixed principle. You scholars have studied for years; also know the Way of nurturing qi? I say to gather the yellow court, warm and refine; this is the work of nurturing qi. Do you also know?

Again showing after water and fire meet to form medicine, must especially know that Heaven and Earth meet to form elixir. Qian is nature; Kun is fate; that is metal and wood united. If only water and fire move, medicine arises, but elixir not formed; surely because after Kan and Li meet, Kun meets Qian; the four images cluster as one mass; then the miracle of creation appears. Also water and fire meet, true Yang first arises. At this I steal its mechanism, draw it up to the celestial palace; gather breath a moment, must vigorously spirit, sweep away distractions, one intention not scattered, one thought not arising. Thus nurturing naturally dragons and tigers contend, shaking Heaven and Earth; suddenly the mud pellet Yin essence transforms to sweet dew and spirit water; cold spring dripping, falling to my red palace; there is a piece of cool and tranquil state. Long so all Yin peeled away, one spirit remains; throat can suck tears, nose can plant onions; the states are varied, all due to spirit fire nurturing, nature ground returning light; all private Yin dissipates to nothing. Thus spirits mutually communicate, qi mutually connects; not only reaching all hair orifices, but also reaching Heaven and Earth, ancient and modern, past and future affairs. Ah! Is spirit immortal? Most wonderful, most mysterious! Truly profound! Only by one bright thought, one qi nurturing, to such degree. My master now reveals the Way; if you meet this scene arising, beware of fright. Fright and spirit flies, qi scatters; again losing the discovery of golden flower.

Pure, upright, chaste and lonely, wishing to cultivate the Great Way, truly an uncommon woman; I deeply pity her, and greatly praise her. In sum, learning the Way has no other than one washing of heart and cleansing of thought, emptying the heart for foundation; empty then spiritual; spiritual then true heart appears, original nature arises. This is a part of illuminating heart and seeing nature. Must know that to illuminate heart and see nature is not a great difficulty. Man can in one thought return to the elixir field, using intention to illuminate; at the first moving thought is the heart. Illumination is illumination here; no other illumination. Before moving thought, one piece of emptiness and brightness, vague and indistinct, utterly without thing; this is nature. Seeing this, there is no other seeing. If truly illuminating heart and seeing nature is so, this is at the time when all Yin congeals and closes, suddenly one Yang first moves, suddenly turn light and reflect; this is what ancients called "Winter solstice Yang birth, midnight child hour arrives." I then turn light and reflect in the breast; this is water source pure; can refine the spirit immortal medicine. Beginning with dispelling disease and lengthening life; ending with becoming sage and true; all based on this one sign. Yet I say this method is extremely high; fearing women find it hard to understand; now I show shallow learning. At the start, the body must sit upright and proper, certainly at ease and quiet; must encourage and urge oneself, thinking all the world’s affairs not truly my real use. Not only children and spouses swiftly become empty; in the end like transient guests, parting all night, each east and west; you be you, I be I, two separate; even the flesh and blood body, once eye light falls on face, breath is gone; this body already dung; what remains is only this heart and nature. If daily cultivate well, one piece of clear mechanism, bright and alert, utterly without dullness, then one ascends to Heaven. When reincarnating, my heart so clear, nature so spiritual, who would willingly fall into ox and horse groups? This shows those who nurture heart and nature well, have benefits for thousands of lives. Clearly, who would choose to be born in poverty and misery? Surely choose good places to be born. This is principle, also affection. Those who have not cultivated, when body dies, heart is muddled and confused; like a blind man wandering, not choosing hills or slopes or dangers; their reincarnation, if bound by grudge and debt, not entering the three paths and six destinies, falls into poverty and misery; this is inevitable. The wise and chaste who have heart for this Way, recently experiencing dangers and hardships, worldly affection surely seen as illusion, not allowing heart to cling again. My master urges you, worldly riches and love, though many, last but fifty or sixty years, eventually parting; how like cultivating Way in body to enjoy billions of years without extinction? Take this to see through mundane dust, open the net of sin, firmly step out, day and night only observe the in-breath and out-breath within the breast; one up and one down, let it be natural and free; exhale not driving to the head; inhale not rushing to the water palace; listen to slow and smooth movement; a hundred or a thousand or more, let it go where it will; do not recollect. Only condense spirit in the breast, regulate breath in the breast, follow its constant out and in; sufficient. Long so, naturally Yang qi arises, body strong and vigorous, far greater than ordinary wealth, family, and children’s joy. Though slight Yin occasionally moves, still gather back into the furnace; do not descend to chat or do worldly affairs; thus day by day, month by month, great effect.

The Great Way is nothing else but one Great Ultimate. Between Heaven and Earth, things transform and grow, most wondrous, endless change, beyond measure. How can this be post-heaven corpse qi? Surely original one yuan qi only. Now Dao companions only refine post-heaven qi, nurture post-heaven spirit; even if done well, only body vigorous; no trace of supreme spirit and wonder; therefore living to a hundred years, dying like grass and trees, though some strong or weak, at root and tomb no different from ordinary men; thus born and die, die and born, revolving and turning; not free from the suffering of six paths and three ways sinking. Because the Way is but one thing; the medicine is but one flavor; without Great Ultimate root and great medicine seed, though day and night cultivating, still only form and qi; wishing to reach profound mystery and wonder, to step on sun and moon, is impossible. The most divine and wondrous, most pure and subtle, changing without form and hidden and manifest, is none other than the great void original qi, that is the limitless. This qi is wide and vast, truly without form; also called "emptiness generating Great Ultimate." Yet ancient and modern sages, heroes, and all flying and swimming, moving and still, creatures born from eggs and wombs and moisture and transformation, none not receiving this original qi. Yet to call it Great Ultimate is yet the end of emptiness, not subject to spirit transformation. When qi mechanism moves, dividing Yin and Yang, alternating soft and hard, then Great Ultimate’s work appears. Great Ultimate is principle; Yin and Yang are qi. Principle and qi united, then Heaven and Earth and man are born. Principle and qi united, then sages, immortals, Buddhas’ elixirs form. You must first gather spirit in emptiness, unite qi in stillness; this heart and body without one thing. Suddenly one awakening moves, using my original spirit transformed into true intention governing the cycling of two qi; then the reality of two qi is still within Great
