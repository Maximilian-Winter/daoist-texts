## Records of the Hall of Joyful Cultivation, Volume Five (Thirty-One Sections)
### One
Though the work of destiny is within our nature, yet to transcend the birth and become a sage, reaching to hundreds, thousands, ten thousands of myriads of incarnations, extending from ancient times to the present, encompassing heaven and earth, there is therein another layer of effort. If one follows the later Confucians’ teaching, it is but to exhaust nature, and beyond that there is no learning. But do they not consider that the Book of Changes says: 'Exhaust the principle, exhaust nature, and thus reach destiny'? Clearly it distinguishes three layers of effort; it is not said that exhausting nature alone suffices to reach destiny. If exhausting nature alone sufficed, why then did Confucius say 'thus reach destiny' with those four words? This shows that after exhausting nature, there is clearly the work of establishing destiny with nature. What is this work? The saying goes: 'Nature can be obtained through enlightenment, but destiny must be transmitted by another.' It is not that it is not granted; it is because the world is full of those greedy for the treasure of destiny, who do not exhaust their efforts on the relations of nature and destiny, so the great root is not established, and to seek the proof of gods and immortals is difficult indeed. Moreover, even should they become gods and immortals, and the heavenly beauties surpass those of the human realm, if the ground of nature is not fixed, when seeing wealth they rise in greed, when seeing beauty they generate desire; are they not still ultimately cast down into hell? It is like the empty space rising nine layers of terraces, unattainable. Furthermore, the study of human nature not having reached its goal, the refined essence, breath, and spirit forged by a private heart are all postnatal impurities; not only are they of no benefit, but certainly evil fire burns the body. Therefore the immortals are reluctant to lightly reveal to men, only when a man has completed three thousand efforts and eight hundred deeds do they speak of the mysterious and expound the law to him. Moreover, who is without transgressions and grievances from past and present lives? Without much meritorious deed and virtue, the debts of sin are difficult to extinguish, and many obstacles arise within. When such obstacles come forward, those ignorant say that my way is not correct, and thus there are heavenly punishments, thereby obstructing the path of future cultivators. Therefore in my teaching I require first the cultivation of merit and virtue before imparting the secret formulas. Those born to learn my way somewhat grasp the opportunity, but must understand prior heaven qi and post heaven qi. What is post heaven qi? It is the qi of the mouth, nose, and breath, which has form. As for prior heaven qi, though it has no form or sound to compare it to, it pervades all within and without the body, confused and flowing, neither moving nor still. Its so-called motion is merely due to post heaven breath's coming and going, ascending and descending, giving the feeling of agitation. Does prior heaven qi truly possess motion? I fear the students do not understand that prior heaven qi has no motion or stillness; when spirit is tranquil and qi harmonized, reason dictates to return it to the furnace for sealing and nurturing, yet still they lead it to ascend and descend; like water which is originally still, yet the wind’s disturbance is unceasing, thus there is never a state of clear calm. If the students understand this principle, not only when the breath stops must the original qi be motionless, even when it does not stop it should cause this true qi always to condense; then the ceaseless mist will brew and exist, and thereby transform essence, transform qi, transform spirit without difficulty. When men eat the taste of the five grains, if it is not stopped and stored and transformed, it is due to the middle qi being too weak; physicians administer pungent and warm medicines, which causes full digestion. How can it be that the mist of one’s own qi often gathers within yet still fails to transform essence, transform qi, transform spirit? The learner must but return the light and reflect, gathering original qi and vulgar qi into the mysterious one aperture; after long time, there will be inexhaustible subtle use. How could this be only to strengthen the body and become an immortal of long life? The saying goes: 'One kalpa of human life, ten thousand kalpas hardly to be born again.' How then may one be negligent?
### Two
I point out the three stages of the mysterious gate, the female door, and the yellow court, precisely so that students may today know how to condense the spirit without having existence or non-existence, and regulate the breath neither inside nor outside; this is the utmost purity and cleanness, a natural and spontaneous divine breath. Ultimately spirit and breath made into one, what distinction or separation can there be? And all is pure and still and natural, so what is there of existence or non-existence? I formerly did not clearly distinguish, because the shallow efforts of students had not yet been understood; suddenly showing this to them, I feared that the turbid impurities and foul qi gathered within would be like a woman not having obtained the true essence of a man to unite and form a cluster; even though the blood qi is stored within the womb, at one month it still transforms into turbid filth. Recently the students have understood the pure and quiet spirit breath, drawing this one yang from the female door in the kan palace to return; it is like a woman obtaining the true essence of a man, uniting into a cluster, at ten months the fetus is round, giving birth to a baby, no different from father and mother. This is to refine with the pure and quiet spirit breath the transformation into a void body. If one obstinately clings to one essence of blood qi, how can one give birth to a void spirit? Therefore I teach students first to stop thoughts, so that one fragment of spirit is bright and clear, reaching straight to its place; in a short time, like a young child, the yang qi is steamed and daily increasing, monthly strengthening, and their spirit will be vigorous without end. Do not say that true yang is like some thing, a real form, or that the elixir field has a real place; although the ancients called it the sea of qi, the ancestral aperture, the root of heaven and earth, the mysterious female door, it has a name but no reality, yet cannot be said to be entirely unreal. Supposing it is void, all transformations arise from it; supposing it is real, in the end not a single thing can be sought. Long abiding in this, this is what I call the elixir field stage, also obscure and unknown in its whereabouts, as if revolving in empty space. Yet one must not entirely pursue in empty space. This boundary is difficult to explain in one word; it must be understood by the students themselves. Nowadays learners, not having yet applied effort, seek quick effect; once using effort, they desire immortality. Such a heart in the chest is a mass of private desire; private desire becomes yin dregs. How can one condense and refine yin dregs and thereby form a formless and imageless yang spirit? This is unreasonable. My master once said: the flesh and blood body is originally postnatal dregs, the great way is not here. But if essence is insufficient, where is qi? If qi is insufficient, where is spirit strong? If spirit is not strong, how can it unite with void and become a natural immortal? I teach men to begin by consolidating essence. The way of consolidating essence is not one-sided, it is not only at the end of lust for color. Such as regulating drink and food, light in flavor, harmonizing the organs, as well as the fluids, blood, sweat, moving, sitting, standing, lying down, all places should be preserved and protected so that essence does not leak out, and essence is sufficient, then qi naturally is sufficient. Nevertheless, it cannot immediately be said to be sufficient. Mencius’s chapter on nurturing qi, the parable of the Ox Mountain, teaches that one guards and preserves the morning qi from dawn; after long time, one has a vast and firm qi filling the space between the eyebrows. If one does not nurture it deeply, how can qi be strong? One must also know that this is the way of internal nurturing, and externally seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting must also be constantly preserved, not allowing a moment to flow into unritual matters or near to unfeelingness. Thus regulating the outside to nourish the inside, and from the inside reaching the outside. Ancient loyal ministers, filial sons who died for loyalty and suffered hardships, only knew where righteousness lay, and did not count anything outside righteousness. Though it is said that righteousness is full, in truth all righteousness is empty. What is real righteousness is qi. If not deeply cultivated, how can there be vast and firm qi soaring to the heavens, a faithful heart piercing the sun, like Yue Wumu, Wen Wenshan, Jin Zhengsheng and other martyrs? They did not fear death, but because they saw reason clearly and nurtured qi sufficiently, they regarded life and death as one. Students must not say that postnatal essence and qi have no relation to prior heaven; one must know that nurturing postnatal is exactly cultivating prior heaven; only fearing to understand roughly the colored body, and not sweeping everything clean, thus becoming a useless shell; how lamentable this is!
### Three
Do not say that perfect sincerity and exhausting nature exhaust the nature of all beings, so as to assist transformation and nurturing, is not in speech, silence, motion, stillness, or daily use and action, but is another marvelous mystery. One must know that utmost evenness and constancy is the utmost divinity and wonder. Students but exhaust what is within themselves, act with strong forgiveness, and all things under heaven and earth are within me. Everyone consider this carefully, is it so or not? If one can truly know the profound within, daily nurture the origin, suddenly confused and flowing, clear and bright, then the mingling of two qi and the silent movement of one origin, truly there is something not in heaven and earth but in me. This is utmost sincerity without ceasing, silent and endless, rendering things without duality, producing beings without measure. Do not be negligent and indulgent, neglecting the freedom of heaven until suddenly it is darkened and blocked, then all outside of heaven, earth, and things will likewise be unsettled. The method of alchemy has no other marvel; it is only refining natural medicines, forming natural elixirs. The ancients used all sorts of comparisons, names, metaphors and images only to imagine the medicine formed the elixir’s radiance, the mind and spirit brightening, the will and qi clear; roughly somewhat like this, but truly it is not real. Students must understand well. Observe the clear empty unity of heaven and earth; though there are clouds and smoke blocking the view, thunder and wind sounding, what sound or colour is there? The cultivation of man is nothing but to imitate the laws and images of heaven and earth, obey the natural course of creation; what image is there? If one says there is really a thing spreading across the middle, it is all later arising dust and conditions, far from my original face, silent and deep, natural and spontaneous. Students must not take the false for true, as heaven and earth do not consider clear emptiness as real, but take smoke and clouds and other illusions of shape and colour as heaven; is this not a great error? My master fears students do not understand that the bright moon in water or daylily in the mirror, though existing and not existing, seem like them; if one takes the boat and seeks the sword, how few are not carried away by demons and spirits! If one deeply cultivates and attains, not only do influences vanish, form and sound perish, even so-called one qi of empty space is not there. Otherwise, as soon as there is attachment, knowledge is limited; as soon as there is form, boundaries are fixed; one cannot cut off the entering and leaving of being and non-being, the myriad transformations and unfathomable mysteries. Students consider this: the marvelous myriad things, nature communicates with myriad things, is it not only a void primal spirit that has such unbounded place and formless shape, yet truly embraces beyond heaven and earth and is not great, enters dust and is not small? If it be traces and images, then here it cannot move there; if it be knowledge, grasping half is not grasping the whole. I wish students to once shake out the empty and spiritual god in their hearts, not letting it flow outward, quickly gather and bring inward, long nurture and refine; naturally transcend birth and transform bones. Other things have form and colour, all postnatal dregs; if there is movement and disturbance, do not manage them; one must warm with divine fire, naturally transforming postnatal coarse essence and qi into prior heaven original essence and original qi. Otherwise not only is the elixir not made, but various forms chase my primal spirit outside, year in and year out, the master not returned; how can I make my own decisions and be the true ruler of heaven and earth? This principle is clear, no room for excess.
### Four
You who hear my instructions are not of one day. 'Lead and tin in the water village, but one taste.' Can you grasp this secret? I think these two words already contain the subtlety of starting and completing the creation of the elixir and fetus. When students begin, the mortal heart is too heavy, mortal fire too intense; therefore all dust emotions and dust scenes, do not say they fail to be sought, the fire nature burning fiercely, even if sought and obtained, is also foolish love and attachment, worry and care, delight, anxiety of gain and loss, endless cycles, which block and obstruct my pure original spirit. Students must recognize that these dust scenes are but toil and haste, passing and fading, utterly disregarded; gain is from heaven, loss is from heaven, existence and non-existence likewise, not allowing one shred or half-particle to disturb my spirit mansion or increase my vexing heat; then a cooling powder is made which restrains future feverish symptoms. If one does not cut off decisively and clings by threads and fibers, it will disturb the spirit mansion and bring vexations. One must seek the cool cave, the whole family moving there, sit peacefully, never go abroad, seek a livelihood in a peaceful nest, long after suddenly brightness dawns, another realm of heaven, like roaming the ancient reign of the Yellow Emperor, like entering the peach blossom garden; the pleasures therein are indeed hard to tell outsiders. This is the cooling medicine for eliminating vexations. When passions are strong and body and mind cannot endure, like boiling soup overturning the cauldron, like raging tides rising to heaven, vexation is then greatest; letting it go is hard to plan, stirring it up breeds change, what method then? The military say to delay attack and take by weakness, to govern the strong by softness, to capture by yielding; this can be learned. At this time one retreats to the cool mountain, lets go of the whole body. Still fearing the fire is intense and steaming, uncontrollable, received within will burn all that is usual in the spirit mansion to ashes. Only by learning the military art, stopping the war and ceasing attack, letting their hundred attacks and ten thousand arrows fly, their shouts unceasing, their insults unbearable, I only endure and bear, not minding them, not expanding on them, as if nothing had happened. Only firmly guarding the camp, nurturing soldiers, patrolling day and night, cautious and not negligent. When their flames subside, I then both guard my spirit mansion and destroy their nests; with such a single drumbeat attack, traitors and rebels can be removed without difficulty. The military art and the method of restraining desires have a common standard. I fear students do not know this method, gathering fire within, few do not scatter with mother and child. Later in alchemy, one must not use the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, all spiritual light to the outside, but gather all within the elixir field, taking it as the root of my living body. The Dao has no other mystery than to gather and consolidate the primal spirit, not letting it go out, always at home; thus those who live a thousand years and those whose spirit transcends ten thousand ages are here. Therefore when alive, the body is warm; when dead, the body is cold; spirit is qi, qi is fire; heaven has this fire, so birth and nurturing are boundless; man has this fire, how can he not live to ten thousand years? As for seeing, hearing, speaking, acting, drinking, lust, wealth, qi, all minute matters should be conducted on the good side, to avoid consuming spirit and qi, so the golden elixir has a root and the dharma body can be formed. This secret is not to be rashly transmitted. It is not that heaven does not permit men to cultivate the Way, but because evil-doers have within their own bodies and lives a dark judge overseeing them, punishment unavoidable, and have karmic debts unyielding; if lightly given, a small person-immortal is formed, knowing a little to gather and hide spirit and soul in the limitlessness, so adversaries in future cannot find them, and the underworld has no way to pursue the soul, causing good and evil in the three realms to be unclear, complaints arise everywhere; whose fault is this? Saying thus I am trembling; how can students not fear?
### Five
Those who come to bow before me, I have no mysterious method to teach. I privately think the Supreme One has said: 'If desire, observe the aperture; if no desire, observe the subtlety.' These two phrases I take as the means to repair the leaks of students, also as the root of generating genuine and perfect attainment of the Way. Desire is not private desire, nor the intentional mind; the meaning of this word desire is between intention and no intention, that is what I often say, to use a little intention. This aperture is not the navel one inch and three fen below, nor is it the field below the elixir field called water village. I teach students to use some intention, close the eyes’ light, condense the ear’s tone, seal the tongue’s thought, hold the body upright, standing tall like rock towering on a high mountain, calm and lofty like the bright moon engraved on pond water, cutting off all external chasing desires, all entangled inner distracting thoughts, one stroke two cuts, all gathered, not a single thread or half-particle remaining. Thus the whole spirit within is gathered into the void aperture, constantly cared for, never forgotten; in due time true nature is discovered, yang qi arises, naturally transforming the long accumulated shadowy qi in the belly so it ceases to be. From this then adding fierce cooking and urgent refining, constantly illuminating, when true yang stirs, gather and seize it, practice ascending and descending, use the method of retreating fire; then the great elixir is not feared as lacking accomplishment. If thoughts arise and feelings grow, it is no hindrance to shake up one’s primal spirit, erect and firm, standing tall without wavering; naturally feelings do not arise and thoughts do not begin. Also keep in mind the past days are many and the days to come few; if one day unfortunately, not knowing when life is to escape the ordinary cage and avoid all vexations? Especially one must think that my one body is relied upon by heaven and earth, cultivated by father and mother; originally hoping to learn to become immortal and Buddha, to attain nirvana; if not deeply cultivated and attained, how can one stand outstanding in the world and repay the great grace of heaven, earth, and parents? With such thought, righteous qi fears not to stretch, evil qi fears not to be removed. Thus essence does not leak, qi does not lean outward, spirit does not scatter outward, and the coloured body may be solid, and the dharma body is thus preserved. This is the Supreme One’s saying of desire observing the aperture. As for the word subtle, the reality of the Way is difficult. All depends on the worker reaching the place where qi and blood harmonize, spirit is comfortable, and freely at ease, no thought no worry; not that there is no thought, but thoughts arise like clouds passing the great void, no attachment, no care; this is the image of subtlety. One must then deduce from this: all who are usually depressed, when reaching this can be free from depression; the faint and weary, when reaching this can be free from faintness and weariness; all are effects of subtlety. The ancients said: 'Immortals have no other method, only produce joy and no sorrow.' This is the real attainment of subtlety. Then I show the reality of observing. At this time, one never fails to illuminate the heart, yet there is no heart to illuminate; never fails to focus on the elixir field, yet it is not that the elixir field can focus. Whether with intention or without intention, following the coming and going of breath, I only clearly see within, not being led by the breath’s rising or falling. This is the subtlety of observing. To sum up, at first slightly lowering the head to look carefully, then slightly stretching the back to collect and brighten, finally reaching lively heavenly mechanism, qi structure rugged; this is the secret to long life. I have seen students whose form and qi decline, spirit weary; teaching them as young children to thoroughly observe within one inch of the elixir field, I fear exerting too much effort is inappropriate; therefore I demonstrate the lively method of observation, which can be done at any time and place. Regarding sitting and sleeping, sitting methods I will not speak of; as for sleeping method, before sleeping the body, first sleep the heart; all matters done, lying on bed, what profit in thinking? Only weary the heart in vain. One must gather and collect the spiritual light, slightly bend the head, shine into the one aperture; naturally spirit and qi mingle and mature, fire and water blend and rest. As for walking, one must shine the spiritual light two or three steps ahead, like a gentle breeze, walking slowly, not letting the body be tired. When standing still, one must know to stand firm and unshaken, like pine or cypress standing strong, neither constrained nor lax; thus is the method of standing.
### Six
My master in former years learning the Way was not free from the entanglements of family, father and son, husband and wife, unable to cut off for a time. Often he would think of the days and months gone, and could not but become anxious; thus the uncut was also cut off, thereby one heart and one virtue, obtaining the golden jade elixir. If then procrastinating today, not letting go tomorrow, day and night thinking of children and grandchildren, how could he know that when impermanence arrives it is impossible to remain in the world to cultivate? Yet I do not teach you to harden your heart and cut off; rather I teach you not to be like the worldly common man, every morning and evening always supporting family and establishing livelihood, thinking for descendants; now this time already passed, strive to exchange that worrying heart for children and grandchildren into your own cultivation of nature and destiny, not stupidly caring about children and grandchildren. Moreover, children and grandchildren have their own blessings; why foolishly imagine and act uselessly? One must understand one’s own matters clearly; do not wait until the setting sun of the western mountains, in utter confusion entering the treasure mountain with empty hands returning, truly pitiful. When students sweep clean this heart, future cultivation of the great elixir is easy to complete. If idle thoughts and worries turn about, even with diligent cultivation, true fire and true medicine are hard to obtain. Students must know: when desire and feeling arise, hasten to sit firmly in the courtyard. If waiting till desire is burning and feelings strong, even with the Kunwu precious sword, it is hard to pull up the root. Only by letting go and becoming empty, releasing the whole body as if nothing is wrong, is it attained. Never oppose it, nor rashly take it up. What I now show is the illness of students; do not think it is old talk and neglect it. Please from today begin to cut off all affections and lusts, entanglements and attachments, all with one stroke, not allowing one hair’s breadth or one moment to obstruct inside; within several months this will have great effect. But this is not to teach you to sever worldly affairs and leave the dust, never engaging with things. Know that living in the dust but with heart in morality, being without desire when among desires, dwelling in dust but coming out of dust, this is the sage. The great way’s difficulty is in firm determination, unable always to have one clear illuminating heart to thoroughly reflect. If one can always thoroughly reflect, be constantly watchful, no matter seeing, hearing, speaking, acting, in noisy or quiet places, all do not leave the heart; never not daily filling and monthly flourishing, accumulating until reaching the realm of great transformation of spirit. Otherwise, there have been many immortals and true ones, few living apart from the dust, and even more poor families, elderly parents, wives and children, weak sons; how can they also become immortals? Only by one thought not scattering, effort not slackening. This is the highest supreme cultivation of transcending the world, yet still not abandoning the way of entering the world.
### Seven
In all things, yin must first cover and then yang be born. Without the preliminary period of warming and nurturing, suddenly desiring the true qi to gather and manifest, this never is. Therefore the Book of Changes says: 'One yin and one yang is called the Way.' It clearly says first yin covers, then yang rises. The principle of heaven and earth producing things is all such. How much more the art of cultivation, which follows heaven’s image and earth’s operation and employs divine work? Now I reveal to students: to have true yang manifest, one must from stillness store and nurture deeply, then can reach ceaseless activity. Do not only hope for true yang to arise but neglect early self-regulation in stillness. I see students all understand my true secret, but the warming and nurturing is not deep, nature and destiny since birth have not been cleansed of dirt and filth; therefore when arising, inevitably mingled with vulgar qi, unable to be refined in one grain of millet black pearl; hence the trouble of gaining and losing. If one can nurture long, finally the beginning of receiving qi into form and all dust and filth thereafter can be eliminated one by one, forming a unique Muni treasure pearl, forever without loss. This is the disease close to students. Recently working, do not seek to produce yang but only seek no yin. Also do not because the Way is difficult retreat; nor because diligence is unfruitful produce weariness. One must know after bitterness sweetness returns, after yin extreme yang is born; in heaven and earth there is nothing not so; how much more the Way of transcending the world and becoming a superior immortal? The vulgar say: 'Leaving home as at the beginning, completing Buddhahood with excess.' Students diligently.
My master’s disciples are not few, but still few have passed the second step; is it not that I cherish and do not give it? Or is it that their ambitions falter, their vision shallow, not knowing that what is gained is not enough, what is not enough is not sufficient, not knowing the vast boundlessness without end, one realm after another awaits? For example some students, all from little accumulation of merit and conduct, no cultivation of yin branches, in the dark a demon obstruction blocks them, so they retreat without progress, doubt without faith. I observe such ones, I am more terrified. I wish you disciples set great ambition, exert great effort, desiring to ferry all these people over, only then yourself attain the fruit of the Way. With such mind, the world is one family, China one person; if not called immortal, who can be? One must know all worldly glory and splendor are fields of vexation; one must jump out of this pass, then not fall into the red dust, and in each life suffer myriad afflictions. Otherwise, one thought not held, more fearing to fall into realms of demons and beasts, even more bitter than bitterness. Without thought one becomes mad, with thought one becomes saint; saint and mad are but a hair’s breadth apart. Delusion is for things, right mind is for man; things and man are not so far apart. Encountering them but not cultivating is truly foolish. Only by breaking this confusion can one be called a great man whose work is accomplished and fame established. As for wife, children, all affections, only a chance meeting at an inn, a night’s lodging then parting, each east and west. The saying goes: 'In the black lacquer coffin, wealth cannot be contained; on the road to the yellow spring, wife and children belong to whom?' Thinking thus, only this great road is my way out. Now luckily hearing the true law, also having good time, can freely act; if not hasten to take refuge, cultivate and stand on one’s own, I fear having passed this will be difficult to meet this good opportunity again. My master rejoices in students having ambition, advancing without retreat; therefore does not spare words, fully breaking down for students. Is it not that my words students have not known? Only fear seeing them as ordinary, accustomed and not perceiving. Like King Yue wishing to revenge Wu, often keeping one person by his side calling: 'Goujian, do you forget the shame of the King of Wu?' My master’s words are likewise to remind and awaken. I hope students take these plain words to heart, thereby encourage your spirit, rouse your forward-going resolve. Only this life, hard to have another; encountering but not refining, empty having this rare opportunity. I wish for your good, and also for your danger.
### Eight
The ancients said: 'In movement refine nature; in stillness refine destiny.' These two phrases already contain the essentials of dual cultivation of nature and destiny, only that men do not know. I now explain in detail. What is refining nature in movement? Movement is not ceaseless motion, but engaging in affairs and responses. Who in the world has no relatives and friends coming and going? Who has no clothes, food, belongings, plans? One must know that when there are affairs, this is the time to apply effort to cultivate nature. If not cultivated here, then where? When I see and hear, speak and act, I seek middle propriety; in joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness I seek moderation; with sons, ministers, brothers, friends I seek to fulfill the Way; in clothes and food I seek appropriateness. Thus coming and responding as it comes, responding and forgetting, not thinking beforehand, not recalling afterwards, treating each thing equally and impartially, without care or calculation; this is called no desire and the heart settles; the heart settles and nature settles. There is no better work in refining nature. Otherwise, abandoning the present, and in solitude and seclusion, self-proclaiming sincere intention and rectifying the heart, all is empty talk without foundation. How is it? Facing circumstances with returning thoughts, responding at every moment, one may nurture nature at all times; when a thought or desire arises, if no one blames oneself, even oneself feels uneasy. This is why refining nature in movement is easier. The ancients said: 'Refine oneself amid dust and vulgarity.' Master Qiu said: 'I cultivated in stillness but gained no great benefit. Later when roaming the markets and responding to affairs, I realized refining in movement surpasses that in stillness by far.' As for refining destiny in stillness, what is said? Stillness is not immobility, but having no affairs and not responding. When I can in no-affair times, no matter walking, standing, sitting, or lying, always send a spirit light down to the elixir field, making spirit embrace qi, mind connect with breath, spirit and qi affectionate and inseparable; thus gathering without dispersing, merging into one, lively and active, coming and going in the elixir field. Thus day after day, month after month, true qi surging, protecting inside and outside the body, the path of the chariot of the river is open. If not true mechanism moving freely, blindly using effort to force this qi to ascend the river chariot, few do not burn one’s essence and blood, generating myriad strange diseases. For refining destiny, in the twelve hours of a day, how many hours are free? I fear students do not tighten themselves; how could they fear many affairs and vexations, and have no free moments for cultivating nature and destiny? Students think: a day is either time to refine nature or time to refine destiny; why wait for spare time to cultivate? As to the river chariot path, when does it open? When students sit in meditation, at first spirit enters qi, only feeling spirit and qi mutually dependent, meeting at the yellow court place; after long accumulation of essence and qi, true qi surges, leaps within the body, feeling the true qi has travelled and encompassed the body, as if riding within cloud and mist. With further accumulation and effort, with essence not leaking, the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth have no place to open or communicate. But one or two months, the river chariot path opens. Alas, men have this true qi, yet it is polluted by dust and stained by private desires. Otherwise, with the five leaks not eliminated, essence and qi leaking, thus the path is polished only to slip down again. Students must from now on apply effort, having a vigorous and brave heart. At this turn, reaching this flourishing state, no matter how beautiful and precious the form, how rich and noble the realm, whether frightful, fearful, pitiful, or angry, I remain unmoved; only refining nature and destiny is my ultimate method, also my final real resting-place, not changing due to things. Such and not advancing, never occurs. My master today teaches methods which students have heard many times, but have not been as considerate and thorough as I, with constant effort and no spare moments. Follow this conduct, there will be great effect; but do not be negligent or waste time.
### Nine
How many years can a man live? The young often do not understand matters; in the autumn of old age, they first know that past days of name and profit are all wasted time and squandered spirit; desiring to seek the root and return to destiny’s art, often not meeting the master, in the end not only accomplishing nothing, but returning empty-handed, and having consumed all the original things of themselves. Is this not greatly lamentable? Since you meet the Dharma assembly, and also encounter my master’s instructions on the highest secret, now at sunset with few good days remaining, still not diligently cultivating, when the sun sets on the western mountain, with mist and shadow deep, it is too late to regret. But the method of cultivation, to them, is but the gathering of postnatal intention to collect the formed elixir of form; even if formed, it is a small art; even if hearing of nature cultivation, not considering the whole great use, still confined to form and colour, unable to transcend form to find the true original man. Thus Confucian cultivation of nature, even when attaining, is still confused and chasing worldly conditions, unable to empty all. If only cultivating the lower field, then it is but small indeed; even if accomplished, hard to compare with the highest vehicle. This is because such cultivators only know to use the mortal mind; the discernment spirit acts as master; they do not know the origin of life and birth. When intention moves and knowledge arises, the prior heaven true spirit’s body, confused and flowing, does not know how it disperses. Once the pure and simple prior heaven body disperses, the postnatal discerning mind becomes master of the body; even if protecting the form, it is but a corpse-guard, how can it transcend being and non-being, divide the body and transform into qi, become hundreds of thousands of incarnations, enjoy hundreds of thousands of ages? Therefore I teach students when the mysterious gate one aperture is wide open, seek that true spirit and true man. This true man is not apart from form and colour, yet is not within form and colour; daily actions are all his doing, but because of the restraint of qi and temperament, and the obstruction of desires, whenever there is a motive, if not obstructed by temperament’s nature, it is entangled by private desire; without great wisdom, one cannot illuminate this secret. I show students that at the moment of letting go of all conditions, without a thread or a hair, calmly and quietly, still and moving, suddenly a spark of spirit light appears; this is my primal spirit. If one can recognize the primal spirit, always as master of my body, then the elixir refined will become a natural great elixir. Otherwise, not knowing the primal spirit, confusedly acting, how can one be in accord with heaven and earth, be immortal gold immortals unbreakable through myriad kalpas? Sanfeng said: 'Man can take purity as body, calmness as foundation, heaven’s heart as master, primal spirit as function, cleverly using to steal the machine, return to creation; what fear is there not to reach the position of heavenly immortals on earth?' Students, at times of affairs or no affairs, always take purity as principle, calmness as body, unmoved, ever watchful and bright; this is heaven’s heart acting as my master. If there is movement, it is primal spirit acting; then one may perform the method of return; understand? Yet at the beginning, one must strive to hold firmly, having a diligent and true heart; not merely greedy for quiet and stillness, falling into stubborn emptiness which lacks any life or movement. Know that in all things difficulty comes before gain; to say all is natural, there is no natural. The ancients said: 'First use fierce fire to rapidly cook and refine, then use gentle fire to warm and nurture.' Naturally private desires are suddenly removed, wisdom becomes clear; the prior heaven primal spirit appears clearly. Recently students have heard my Way’s subtlety, but not yet reached the turning point of returning the elixir and using the step of refining the void; still not apart from fierce refining and gentle nurturing to steam away filth and melt dregs; only then is there vast prior heaven original qi and primal spirit arising. If refining the void arises, there is no private one, no doing all things, this is natural work. If there is half private or a thread, then the method of cooking and refining must be applied. If the mysterious gate one aperture has no form or colour to observe, also not the meeting of heart and kidney qi to produce its sign, then no good secret is formed. At first gathering nature to govern feelings, suddenly kidney qi surges, true mechanism appears; this is the kidney’s mysterious gate. Then returning feelings to nature, suddenly heart and spirit become joyful and smooth, qi mechanism opens wide; this is the heart’s mysterious gate. This is the body of true knowledge and spiritual knowledge. If man can stand firmly here, not moved by other things, naturally day by day, month by month, approaching the bright realm. In short, where is the mysterious gate fixed? When it is wide open, throughout the body there is no place not mysterious gate; in a day there is no matter not mysterious gate. This is not for shallow men to know. Yet what I teach today, though called destiny work, is in fact the supreme vehicle method; this is the liquefying elixir and revealing nature and enlightening the mind; different from other sects that only speak of destiny work, rigidly working on the colored body, seeking life and survival. Students must slowly and carefully cultivate the true essence of heart and nature; once attained hereafter the effort is only to form this heart and nature into a formed thing. As for returning to root and restoring destiny, it all depends on accumulating lead and adding mercury; not distinguishing early or late in images. Many say young men easily accumulate lead, old men hard to add mercury; not knowing true lead and true mercury are not things of the colored body, nor do they depend on age. The ancients said: 'This lead is not a thing in dust,' and this mercury is also not found in color and form; must be sought in the clear empty one qi, before chaos divides. Therefore the Way says: 'Accumulate lead in the dust world.' If it were a thing of form and color, the dust world bustling and noisy, no clear and pure place, how can true lead be accumulated? Yet lead has distinctions. The yang of destiny arising, quiet cultivation matter, this is one method of accumulating lead. If the lead of the nature ground, that is Mencius’s so-called vast qi born of accumulated righteousness. Where righteousness is, it is not one side only; sometimes gains from cultivating poetry and speaking of rites; sometimes from discussing present and past and being moved; sometimes from meeting friends and having insight; sometimes from viewing mountains and waters and having vision; furthermore acting benevolently, teaching righteousness, helping the poor and rescuing the distressed, various righteous deeds, occasional response, sudden entrance to the great vehicle. These accumulations of righteousness are true and real practical conduct. If one can at the moment of opportunity truly recognize them as my originally belonging genuine things, one glance and one grasp, daily continuously quiet illumination work, such enlightenment is true enlightenment; what is obtained thus is forever obtained. This is the wonderful method of accumulating righteousness. Mencius said: 'The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence; the heart of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness.' If I can act as my heart and apply evenly, and always brew the situation that arises, not letting it go and come, vanish and be born, that is expanding and accumulating true righteousness. Therefore day and night be cautious, not letting the heart have any place of unkindness or unrighteousness, so as not to be ashamed in secret and regret before spirit and brightness; then my heart has no unhappiness and my will naturally perfect, that is Mencius’s 'straight nurture without harm, utmost great and firm, filling heaven and earth.' This is the accumulation of lead to the utmost. If occasionally slightly revealed and unnoticed, one point of true original heart essence, though vast and deep with actual gain, in a moment or one matter not cautious, one thought slightly wrong, this heart is not happy and perfect; this is Mencius’s saying: 'If conduct is not satisfied in the heart, then it is starved.' Do you also know? This is accumulating lead in movement, the mysterious gate in nature begins. I observe today’s cultivators often only focus on the destiny point, forgetting the root of nature, only talking about quiet cultivation accumulating lead and adding mercury, not knowing that in movement lead and mercury must also be taken at all times, so gains are less than losses; days of life are few, days of loss many. If one can in movement, no matter great merit or small virtue, all act, just as the fitting time and place, the spirit is always happy and sufficient, this qi naturally feels vast, vigorous, surging and wanting to rise, as if soaring to the heavens and rushing across the Milky Way. I ride this awareness to expand it, promote it, guard it from idleness; naturally the qi’s momentum is fiery and bright, ascending to the heavens, encompassing heaven and earth, spanning ancient and present, indescribable and unnameable. How could it be only like nurturing during stillness, misty and surging, flourishing and vigorous, penetrating muscles and bones, washing marrow and cutting hair? Alas, today’s students mostly are ignorant of this, often used to peace and quiet, taking worldly gold and jade, wealth and fine wives and concubines, delight in sounds and colours as their profit. They do not know that though gains are had, among them is a segment of violent qi, proud qi, full of false stinginess, various dust filth; true qi is drowned by it; only pity that they are lost and do not awaken to such an extreme. Now I warn students, all daily affairs, myriad feelings, all I treat as cause responding to cause, people treating people; no matter great or small, everywhere is a segment of great harmonious qi; I then hold this to prevent further indulgence, so righteousness accumulates. From this one point of joy and encouragement, wherever there is movement, I accumulate it, daily filling, monthly flourishing; not difficult to surge across the four seas, encompass the six directions. Only fear learners not carefully discriminate, presently missing this original person. If students have true heart, naturally true qi; having true qi, naturally true essence; thus endlessly playing and admiring. Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, all everywhere thus. Only by careful experience, surely nothing fails to obtain its truth. Yet it is not the worldly enjoyment; but only one point of coolness and calm. Not only others cannot know, even oneself does not know its reason. Do not let this qi arise and not expand, then seek elsewhere. This is the beginning of benevolence and righteousness; then one is a servant to affairs, blocked by reason; this harms the Way and wounds qi, only one cause.
### Ten
I speak of accumulating righteousness to generate qi, which is the study of removing human desires to preserve heavenly principle; the great way of the golden elixir is the transformation of qi and body to restore the original method. Herein is great distinction. Which? The study of removing human desires is the study of cleansing the flow; the study of transforming qi and body is the study of clarifying the source. Human desires arise from afterwards; qi and body are received at birth; because qi and body have partiality, later material desires arise because of it. If one only removes external enticements, but does not transform the burden of qi and body, the origin is not clear, how can the end be pure? Even if attainment is very deep, if qi and body are not transformed, the root remains. Therefore the ancients refined the elixir, only refining oneself, not conquering oneself. This shows the ancient immortals refined the initial qi and body with divine fire, still like removing weeds by their roots, cultivating virtue like nurturing a tree deeply at the root; not like the study of accumulating righteousness which only seeks outside and does not know to first pull out the root. As the Dao De Jing and Huangting scriptures teach, they only teach the method of refining; other teachings of conquering self and removing private desires are not detailed. Why? The cause of life and death is that the root of yin and yang is not removed. Heaven is three yang, earth three yin; with these three yang and three yin, life and death depend on this. The ancients knew that if the root of yin and yang is not removed, life and death are firmly bound. Therefore they sow one yang seed in the earth palace, earth becomes real and forms kan; then draw one yin to lodge in heaven, heaven becomes void and forms li. This is the method of taking the kan, taking the yang I sow and placing it in the central yellow position, to unite with the spiritual mercury of li, refining a segment of misty qi, called the elixir root. When students obtain this root, then operate divine fire, adding outer furnace fire talisman, urging it to rise to the mud pellet, then from the mud pellet returning to the scarlet palace, to unite with yin essence, refining a primal spirit; slowly nurturing it with divine fire, when the fetus is full, then transforms a true man, spiritual and unparalleled, endlessly transforming. This is 'planting the other kan position solidly in the heart, dotting my li’s inner abdomen yin'. Nothing but taking the prior heaven one yuan qi as the elixir mother; within the elixir mother again produces yang lead; with this yang lead subduing the yin essence in li; over time, spirit, blood, and qi all transform into a purely yang and utmost firm body, steaming the skin, scorching the bones, utterly burning away the postnatal qi and nature; also extinguishing the flesh and blood body, leaving only one point of true spiritual dry yang qi, able to be or not be, large or small; thus transcending life and death, escaping reincarnation; heaven and earth have an end, but I alone have no end; heaven and earth have life and death, but I alone have no life and death; by this yang spirit being most void and most non-existent. Yet the utmost void is the utmost real; the utmost non-existent is the utmost existent; therefore I can produce heaven and earth and myriad things, but heaven and earth and myriad things cannot produce me. Considering thus, when students attain this realm, even the vast heaven and earth cannot reach me. Students must not say this realm is difficult; only fear men are unwilling to accumulate essence and accumulate qi to establish the foundation. If the foundation is established, there is true joy, no hardship unbearable. But the ancients likened the initial effort to iron bun, not easy to chew. If one can chew out flavor in the tasteless, future efforts will be like breaking bamboo, not difficult to gradually reach the utmost.
### Eleven
The ancients said: 'From chaos and confusion one awakes, and becomes the seed of immortality.' Truly not empty words. But one must know that this awakening is not sought with intention, nor accidentally obtained without intention. From long nurture in confusion and chaos, deeply stored, when the spirit is touched, natural heavenly sounds arise; the so-called breaking of front and back. This is the light of nature, the true awakening, the unsurpassed right and proper awakening, the original man. If I do not first join spirit and qi in the void aperture, after long habit, spirit and qi merge and flow smoothly, become one piece, not separated; how could there be sudden awakening? This is almost no intention or intention, having intention without intention, like the one who tends fire. At first a cluster of steaming qi condenses in the middle, no visible fire, yet fire is naturally here; like consciousness within chaos. After long accumulation, fire force sufficient, suddenly sunlight appears, burning heaven and scorching earth, with irresistible power; yet fire initially knows not itself, nor controls itself; this is the image of consciousness still within chaos; this analogy is closest. Students must from chaos accumulate thus, so that spirit light condenses and does not scatter; then one awakening is perfect brightness, clear and unobstructed; this is my one point of spirit light, original true face, able to transcend no-leak, realize nirvana, and become great awakened thusness Tathagata golden immortal. Especially know that before one awakening, there is only a segment of misty qi; after awakening, only a segment of spirit light alone operates in space; no trace of thought or consciousness enters; do not say that external matters or even my spirit light point is not known; it just suits its nature. Ordinary men after awakening have myriad thoughts and ideas, one thought goes, one thought comes; even within one moment there is endless cycle of life and death; how can they speak of no restraint after death by ghosts and spirits, the melting and molding of yin and yang? Therefore the more confused the spirit, the more chaotic the qi; the illusory body is still hard to keep; how much more the dharma body? Even spirit and qi remain, but sunk long, regarding suffering as joy, recognizing poison as sweet; until death confused, still not awakened; so greed, anger, ignorance, and love are no different from before birth; therefore in life after life there is no hope of escape, no complete extinction. If this is so, it is all because after awakening one cannot accumulate it as nature, develop it as feeling, let nature be natural, listen to things’ influence, conceal and reveal agree, still illumination all returning; therefore sometimes joy and anger, sometimes sorrow and happiness, taking evil as right, mistaking falsehood for truth, utterly destroying innate goodness. Who knows that arising and ceasing are impermanent, at once a fiery pit, now all black prison; why wait till after death to see? Only the perfect man exhausts the wonderful meaning of creation, recognizes the root of life and death, suddenly awakens in this chaos, immediately grasps and holds, not letting it run wild or return; only one star of spirit light shines in the sky, bright and always present, dazzling and not dim; at first not knowing there is awakening, not knowing there is illumination, not knowing there is holding; this is the time of divine knowledge, knowing the secret of spirit. From this day, the sun operates the yang fire, night retreats yin talisman, wrapping this supreme ultimate true principle; over time spirit fills and qi grows strong, suddenly becoming great awakened golden immortal, never born or extinguished. Do not say this one awakening is not my immortal root, and seek other marvelous techniques. This one awakening sees only my body and mind empty, luminous and pure, without dust or cloud, like refined gold or fine jade; therefore after one awakening, joy is unspeakable. One thought of awakening is one thought of bodhi; one moment of calm breath is one moment of nirvana; is not this truly an immortal of awakening? Yet in chaos and confusion one awakening has true and false. Nowadays men, once confused, think it is chaos; once knowledge arises, think it is awakening; these all mistake thief for son, hardly can succeed. Only when in nothingness suddenly heavenly mechanism is activated, clear and bright, void and lively, can one say true chaos and true awakening; otherwise none but mistake confusion for chaos, knowledge for awakening. Students must know chaos is not the root, awakening is not the root; one must from chaos and awakening come to a realm of pure silence, clarity, clear emptiness and mysterious brightness, then attain true condition; do not use the words vague and confused to cover the matter.

Between heaven and earth there is nothing but one red furnace. Man able to endure the world’s fiery refining, regardless of roaring and intense, pitiful and sorrowful conditions, I remain unmoved. Knowing that my flesh and blood lump is all composed of the four great aggregates, not my original true body. My true body originally dwells within the form, stands beyond the organs and bones, sometimes still, vast and flowing, like the ocean’s vastness; sometimes moving, flowing and dignified, no different from the river’s tides. Such movement and stillness all silently conform to its natural truth; over time ice melts and snow dissolves, naturally there is one standing without form, not borrowing the body to exist. Therefore all affairs, all responses, all burdens and hardships, are all seen as the furnace and hammer of heaven and earth; thus the heart remains unmoved. Moreover, it is not only unmoved, but also unrelated to my original man. Still more, original things are only temporary external conditions and entangled clutter, the more fading worldly feelings, the more empty color and form; thus transcendently independent beyond form and bones, standing alone between heaven and earth. If not called immortal, then who? I observe most men are greedy for power and profit, fond of sounds and colours, not knowing in their body is a true immortal standing within, protruding without; whenever things do not please, do not go as wished, they say destiny fails, spirits do not aid; even speak reproaches, heart generates slanders, blaming the dark heaven and silent spirits for such misfortune and ignorance. Alas! All because they do not know their body contains an original man who does not share life and death with form and bones. Why? Because everyone has a void and spiritual original body, only because of smooth and easy conditions, drowning in the field of sounds and colors and wealth and profit, only knowing there is a mortal body, not knowing there is a true body. Therefore the ancients said: 'Favorable conditions are hard to meet, adverse conditions easy to get.' This is so. Mencius said man 'is born of worry and dies of ease'; is it not so? Because original color and form do not change for myriad years, from chaos to now, wise not increased, foolish not decreased. Yet why are those who see the Tathagata, return to root and restore truth so few? Only because this original man, if not stirred, rests in calm; if not ground, is confined to habit; hence no way to see. Only when things come thick and fast, meet and grind, then in dire times and pressing situations, must one turn back and think of old things. Therefore it is said: 'Heaven and earth are one great furnace and hammer.' Moreover heaven and earth open and close; the light clear floats up as heaven, becoming sage and spirit; heavy and turbid condense down as earth, becoming mortal and thing. Only man stands between heaven and earth, half clear and half turbid, mixed yin and yang; if one can cultivate virtue to restore original face, then the light and clear ascend and become immortal; if one greedily nourishes desire, only cultivating the illusion of form, then the heavy and turbid condense down and become ghost. Like the red furnace refining gold, dregs melt and melt into mud; fine gold is smelted and made into a precious sword. Without this fierce fire, how to melt dregs and form sharp weapons? Thus the gentleman so acts quietly and steadily, nothing forbidden; only by truly recognizing the original man can all outside hardship and dead ends not disturb the mind; not only the heart not moved, but due to these hardships, can deepen care and worry, seeking only a peaceful nest. Therefore the ancients walked danger like peace, all due to hardship and grinding. To sum up, circumstances cannot burden a man; those who burden are vulgar men. If one is a man of the Way, having first clearly seen the heart and nature, recognized my being is not in this flesh and blood cavity, but has a transcendent and distinct, lofty and solitary, joyous and content true self. Otherwise the flesh and blood lump is but due to a moment’s difference in initial thought, unable to hold; thus fallen into the four great dusty world; thus lodging here, leaving form here; this is an illusory body, lasting no more than a hundred years, finally decaying and rotten; what honor in obtaining, what shame in losing, what peace in life, what suffering in death? Therefore I sharpen conduct and strengthen will, always focus on fiery refining in the red dust furnace; with things and burdens as hard tasks to refine the body; without things and conditions as clear and pure to wash the heart. Thus always in change and transformation, although circumstances differ, the refining of my colored body to be clean, bright, and not dim, is one. Have you ever truly recognized the original man? My master thinking of students’ long seeking the Way, now pointing out the original things’ one point of color and form, so that the chest has a handle, then not afraid of dust and toil. How to see it? This is the vastness in movement, the deep depths in stillness, a cluster of qi mechanism flowing through the body; do you recognize it? This is what the ancients said: 'The three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit combined as one.' If one nurtures this and returns it inside, then in the elixir field there is a cluster of misty, harmonious, and tranquil mechanism; this is the original man’s manifestation. Fearing too many burdens obstruct cultivation, only recognize the original man clearly, always take this as root; as the saying: 'All colors and flowers are spring.'

All things under heaven, when full to the utmost, imply the image of extreme emptiness; when utmost flourishing, imply the mechanism of utmost decline. When things exhaust, they change and renew; when men exhaust, they return to root; when time exhausts, it returns to origin; moreover if the turbid essence is not removed, how can pure qi flow? The ancients worried at times of danger and urgency, yet were unmoved in heart. Therefore King Wen in prison at You-li expounded the Book of Changes; Confucius in distress at Chen and Cai played the zither and sang; whenever encountering unbearable conditions, others could not be calm, but sages were serenely alone. Precisely because virtue, wisdom, skill and intelligence, having passed through disaster, illness, sorrow and worry, their wisdom deepens, their virtue brightens; compared with those in peaceful and smooth places, their progress is boundless. Man’s trouble is inability to cultivate the Way; not trouble at external insults frequently coming; virtue’s trouble is inability to advance; not trouble at myriad calamities arriving. Because one time’s adversity is easy to pass, but countless generations of clear blessings are hard to seek. Only by thoroughly experiencing hardships and dangers, then exerting effort to advance, resolutely cultivating, can one enjoy millions of years of wealth, rank, and fame, never perishing. Those wretches Qin and Cao, boasting one time’s power, leaving ten thousand years’ foul name, and falling to the bottom of prison, never to exit; compared with military sages Yue Shaobao and Wen Wenshan, who lived a life stained, but are praised for thousands of generations, which is better? Moreover the two sages with flesh and blood illusory bodies, utterly destroyed the true bodies of Qin and Cao for thousands of years; their gains and losses need no dispute. Furthermore, wealth, rank and glory are all transient external things; gain is not to be rejoiced, loss not to be worried; how much better to preserve my spirit yang and delight in my nature heaven! Unfortunately ordinary men do not understand the secret of the nether world, nor the principle of men and ghosts; so they cling to dust and conditions, until death not letting go; who knows that mortals regard life and death as different, and day and night as normal, while perfected men deeply understand the subtlety of yin and yang, life and death, directly regarding life and death as day and night? Like the matters of tonight, once sleeping one rests; when morning comes, father, brothers, wife and children are as before, friends and relatives remain; as to dealings and interactions, nature and feelings, all joys and sorrows, not one tiny bit is not as before. This is the theory of cycle and cause and effect, so does not change through myriad kalpas. Alas, men of the world live poorly this life, often pinning hopes on future kalpas, but not thinking that today they are ignorant, will they be wise next life? If unable today, can there be ability in another life? This is false. The saying goes: 'A journey of a thousand li begins with the first step; a tower of a thousand layers begins with piling earth.' If one desires to enjoy blessings in old age, one must from youth labour diligently; if one desires intelligence in another day, one must from this life nurture; if one desires wealth and rank in two kalpas, one must from this day plant. Therefore 'Laozi did not come from heaven, nor did the Tathagata arise from the earth.' Only by diligent, cautious, seeing reason clearly, guarding nature firmly, can one commune with heaven and earth. I only fear men unwilling to lay down the butcher’s knife, only thinking to become Buddha on the spot, so childhood ambition and learning, old age with no achievement, only nourish vain thoughts. Also heard the ancients say: 'All is the matter before the eyes; the enlightened find heaven, the deluded find hell; both return to the supreme cause.' The enlightened is life energy, the deluded is killing energy. Therefore the alchemical scripture says: 'Entering worldly ways while cultivating transcendental methods; conforming to common ways while cultivating alchemical ways in opposition.' Thus wine, lust, wealth, and qi, common men lose their lives by these; saints gain virtue by them. Same bed but different dreams; saint and commoner only differ in this regard. Students know the original true face; now advancing cultivation still must directly ascend bodhi and ultimately become great Way. The first is to nurture this heart like the bright moonlight of autumn, pure without dust, spring flowers shining, natural talent delighting, as if without a care; this counts as the sage’s empty and clear spirit study. Otherwise, do not say the presence of evil thought is burden of heart, even the presence of good heart that does not fall below Mani, is also an obstruction of my Way. Though the ancients have cause of firmness and cause of gentleness of proper qi, attaining a spacious and accommodating place, all must gain one side; even if accomplished, at most a spirit and deity only; inevitably still turn kalpas, be born again in six paths, suffering. I again show students, the beginning of true cultivation is but: no matter what happens, let this heart not be disturbed; when there are affairs, let this heart not be troubled; in stillness and movement, in change and constancy, no matter how often external calamities come, the heavenly lord is calm; never gains or losses thereby. Therefore it is said: 'Vast and great work, things come and conform.' Whether affairs or no affairs, at peace or in danger, only change the circumstance, not the heart. Keeping such heart, desire is not suppressed but suppresses itself; sincerity not present but preserves itself. This is no other than the wondrous method of cautious and careful reverence to the supreme; begin with effort, ultimately return to natural. Students moreover must know: the Way is in human relationships, virtue is in mind and nature; absolutely do not cultivate in isolation sitting idly to seek elixir. Mencius’s nurturing qi and accumulating righteousness, when conduct is not satisfied, qi is starved. In daily behaviour, seek to conform to measure; sometimes smoothly and easily, heart calm and reason at ease; whether viewing mountains and waters, or in joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, all is vast qi flowing, righteous qi spreading, with clear faces and bright backs, naturally manifesting without words; must glance down and return light, clearly recognize, accumulate and nurture, expand and fill, until reaching the realm of great transformation of spirit. Do not add one point of view or one thought, only calmly and freely, clearly and fully, earnestly hold and maintain, protect and not lose the footing.

Heavenly principle and human desire cannot coexist, nor is there middle reason. If not heavenly principle, then it is human desire. The body of unrefined man, thought arises and ceases always on dust emotions; all matters not closely related, not concerning one’s own proper portion, without exception arise and cease, turn and generate, never stopping. And from man’s view, it seems neither good nor evil, balanced and neutral. Not knowing that if mixed thoughts are not removed, dust roots not cut, all later evil and deluded conditions root here. This is the womb of human desire, the seed of myriad evils; students must not fail to carefully observe. To remove human desire’s root, one must first gather the heart. Many methods of gathering the heart exist; Buddha has stopping and observing and holding precepts; these are the best methods. What is stopping and observing? It is counting breaths and observing the tip of the nose, watching the in and out breath circulate, slightly collecting and harmonizing with intention; this is the Confucian transformation of qi and body. As for gathering the heart by precepts, it is Confucian conquering of self and avoiding propriety in seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting. These two methods, removing private desire in formless and imageless times, removing private falsity in doing and performance, are precisely the Confucian method of dual cultivation of movement and stillness, internal and external nurturing. Thus removing desire, then reason remains; like disappear and immediately appear; no need to add a further step of preserving reason outside of suppressing desire. If again added, it adds later arising private consciousness, which blocks the one point of true void and subtle presence, obstructing it. Nowadays students mostly add preservation of reason outside of removing desire, so that obvious heavenly light and sun and moon shine freely, calmly and clearly; yet the moving and conscious discerning spirit is like space that is originally empty, but with floating obstructions and smoke blocking the space. If so, though far from deluded and evil mind, yet blocking the space is one and the same. Therefore lifelong study of the Way comes to one matter, failing to respond appropriately; when encountering matters retreating, or facing matters becoming agitated; all sorts of falsities never removed; all sorts of bad habits always present; no wonder true nature is not seen, evil thoughts not removed, and seeking the Way but not obtaining the Way. Is this not to betray a lifetime of effort? To sum up, nature is originally void; once clear and free, nature is seen. The heart is originally spiritual; once bright, awake, clear and unobstructed, the heart is seen. After clarifying mind and seeing nature, do not attach even one bit of thought or imagination; only follow its natural spontaneous course. If you have not reached this spiritual transformation, once this heart is hollow and this nature is clear and bright, nurturing not deep, regulating not mature, once loosened it vanishes; yet it is no harm to rouse spirit and awaken. The Book says: 'Man’s heart is dangerous, the Way’s heart is subtle. Only with refinement and unity, truly hold the center.' These sixteen characters of heart transmission are not without power to awaken. Yet to write 'awaken' and 'rouse' is also a flaw; if not good at understanding the subtle meaning, then inevitably after 'awaken' add another 'awaken', after 'rouse' add another 'rouse', like floating clouds blocking space. I show students a key: if heart and spirit are dim and unaware, no harm in awakening and rousing; but only one illumination and constant alertness; outside of awakening no second awakening; after alert no second alert. This is the non-dual method, true effort.
### Fifteen
The Way of cultivation first requires recognizing heart and nature, straightforward and precise, then the proper time and medicine combined with clear empty one qi to roast; then not falling into stubborn emptiness, nor rigid adherence. What is nature? The Poem says: 'The carrier of heaven, without sound or smell.' Supreme indeed, subtle indeed; no meaning of nature surpasses this. Since you have understood this principle, still should guard it with confused, ignorant spirit, purely letting nature spontaneously be; then you can be one with the great void. What is heart? It is our spiritual knowledge and true awakening; Mencius calls it good knowledge. In short, this true heart differs from mortal heart. Mortal heart has forms of existence and non-existence, birth and death, arising according to conditions, arising according to circumstances, various transformations, unpredictable; this is called private consciousness, cannot be called true heart, cannot be the root of alchemy and cultivation. Only the true heart’s awakening is not conditionally arisen, not self-born from circumstances, luminous and always shining, truly pure and subtle bright, able to respond to all affairs without hindrance. One must have this spiritual awakening heart, then can nurture the void and nothingness of nature. If not first having this heart, then nature is dim and unclear, many fall into stubborn emptiness. Since you have understood this nature and void realm are not two bodies, you must use the spiritual awakening heart to illuminate, govern, and preside over it. Then this nature, great and greater than the great void, whatever birth and death, ever-changing, favorable or adverse, cannot disturb my nature heaven. Therefore having heart is to nurture nature, and nurturing nature is not before having heart. The Song Confucians divide heart and nature into substance and function; nature is heart’s substance, heart is nature’s function, not far from reason. Yet examining carefully, it cannot fully explain the subtlety. Nature has no motion or stillness, yet embraces motion and stillness, pervades motion and stillness; one cannot divide nature by substance and function by heart; it is clear. Nevertheless, to show the convenience to later students, one must divide heart and nature into two things; since nature is without beginning or end, no place to begin; only by preserving postnatal true knowledge and awakening heart, to nurture prior heaven soundless and scentless nature; in fact preserving but not preserving, not preserving but preserving, nurturing but not nurturing, not nurturing but nurturing, so as to obtain the root of heart and nature, and not fall into later arising artificial fabrication. This must be silently understood by students; I only speak the general outline. I wish students in movement and stillness, quiet and alert, alert and quiet, then the void spiritual body and function have reached their utmost. Long nurturing, heart and nature merge, nature and heart harmonize, thoroughly merged as one, with no trace to be found, neither outside void nor without awareness, awareness but always void. Truly quiet and settled as still water, clear and bright as the bright moon, illuminating without illumination, illuminating but not illuminating, always made one piece, thoroughly merged without trace; responding to affairs, no matter thousands of threads and myriad matters, all have order and reason. This true quiet and pureness is like heaven and earth covering all, like sun and moon illuminating all. Yet this position, great transformation flowing, no different from heaven, is not easy to reach. I do not blame you. For your sakes, only follow a calm and quiet mind; if no affairs, heart and nature do not darken; if affairs, heart and nature do not be disturbed; leisurely and elegant, sparse and falling; responding according to things, conforming to conditions; I do not become weary over matters, nor hope over matters to come; like mirror light, clear and bright, without dust or stain, no increase or decrease. This is nurturing in no affairs. When things crowd in and chaos occurs, difficult to manage all, only be not vexed and not agitated, not negligent and not wasted; handle step by step, leisurely respond. This is true heart, not mixing with mortal heart; using it to respond to affairs and meet things, naturally one thread connects a thousand heads. If mixing any birth and death, joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, love and hate mortal heart, then one bright spirit penetrating ten directions, all realms, is disturbed and blocked by postnatal dark consciousness, and my spirit able to be calm and respond is also polluted and not spiritual. Students recently have understood heart and nature; must always nurture; beginning with effort, later with righteousness, essence, and benevolence matured, no place not fitting its heaven and mind. This is not difficult, near to me now; looking down it is so. Yet not easy; the ancients once knew it with surplus, took a hundred years to accomplish and still not enough. The Dharma values constancy and gradual progress only. I see students at rest are alert and quiet, not obscuring the source of heart and nature; yet in movement, due to things and conditions, responding accordingly, still not fully thorough nor earnest; still cannot avoid weariness, laziness, and annoyance. Why? Because nurturing is not deep, practice not perfect. Now you have understood this heart and seen this nature, do not hesitate to be empty and hollow everywhere and all the time, clearly and spiritually, not a speck of dust, all conditions empty. Thus true heart always remains, mortal heart naturally cannot dry up. I again show students a method: this heart must be like a bright mirror; before matters come, this heart is empty and hollow as before, quiet to nurture its substance; once matters come, this heart is spirit awakening as usual, also void to nurture its spirit brightness. Moreover one must understand primal nature, mortal nature, primal spirit, discerning spirit, then not mistake thief for son. If students truly know the information in the original heart and nature, its flavor is inexhaustible; looking at external conditions, not stained by them, regard as dung, utterly without a trace of interest; only protect the spirit body, truly always present; the joy is beyond naming. When students reach the moment of gathering, truly one moment is worth a thousand gold. Only fear students do not see true nature, do not obtain true joy. If truly obtained, naturally eternally obtained. The ancients sacrificing body to achieve benevolence, abandoning life to choose righteousness, all recognized and attained the truth here, nurtured fixedness; though knives and saws before them, cauldrons and tripods behind, willing to lose body and perish rather than obscure heart or lose nature. Otherwise, how could they not fear life and death so much? It is probably because they saw the Way clearly, guarded the Way strongly, and obtained the true medicine within. I wish students, nurtured by one point of true medicine to great vast qi flowing, vast and spreading; at this time even with peerless beauties, supreme precious jade, they would not exchange this for that. This is not forced. The sage’s study originally has no compulsion; compulsion is not the Way. Only letting it be natural, not exerting the slightest effort, this is the true study of sages and worthies. If not reaching this stage, though saying heart and nature are fully clear, still cannot avoid wavering and undecided. If reaching the summit, truly there are those who would abandon a thousand gold and not care, discard ten thousand chariots and not regret. I see students clearly knowing the source of heart and nature, truly without worry or fear, naturally not changing with wealth, rank, poverty or lowliness. The three teachings’ sages speak of benevolence, elixir, and emptiness, each different, but all do not go beyond the one character nature
