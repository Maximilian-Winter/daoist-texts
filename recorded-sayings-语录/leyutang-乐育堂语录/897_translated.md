# The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai

## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume the First

Compiled by the Purple Pot Daoist Xie Xiandao  
### Discourse between Master and Disciples  
The true Master Hai Qiongbai, together with Peng Xiang of the Crane Forest, and the Master Liu Yuanchang of Purple Origin, met upon the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when stars hung low and the moon sank, smoke arose and dew fell; all households were closed, no one was abroad on the roads. They clasped hands and passed through the Pomegranate Blossom Cave. Presently dawn arrived; they forgot their return, sitting upon the perilous rock, and bade two sons to arrange seats on either side. Turning to them he said: ‘Heaven above and men below, what night is this this night? The way to the divine firmament is far, and the purple palace is thinly inhabited. You two have long studied the immortal way! Is there no doubt you may put to me?’

The true Master said: ‘Laozi says: There is a thing mixed and formed, born before heaven and earth. This in some measure is well said. Later men call it Dao, call it Mind, call it Nature, call it Spirit, call it Qi, call it One Thought, call it Law, call it Teaching, call it Art, call it Feeling. Alas! Branches and sects divide, how can they know if the thing mixed and formed really exists?’

The true Master said: ‘Great creation is silent; the wind sounds of itself, the music arises spontaneously; winter departs and ice must melt, spring comes and grass grows of itself; swallows and summer arrive, wild geese go; in autumn the frost descends and plum blossoms open; on moonlit nights the fireflies shine. This is natural and spontaneous. To reach this point, the mouth desires to speak but words fail; the heart desires to follow but thoughts are lost.’

The true Master said: ‘Great creation is non-action; original accomplishment does not govern. Asked, How is this? He replied: The nest knows the wind, the hole knows the rain. Alas! Man indeed!’

The true Master said: ‘The world asks about all the laws, and all the gates within the laws: these are all the formulae of combined medicines, the medicines for healing sickness. You must know that when the decoction is applied, then the medicine begins to take effect. Asked: How is the decoction applied? He replied: The heart is the decoction’s agent.’

The true Master said: ‘One day, the officers of the Thunder Division reported, saying: Where there is an incense burner, there is the Jade Pure Mansion of the Divine Firmament. The Master asked: The Scripture says there are three thousand six hundred divine maidens constantly by my side, and the lament says three ten-thousand six thousand spirits in my body. Are these Scriptures and incantations truly words of the Highest? Are they real or false? True or vain? The answer was: Man’s body has within three treasures: daily essence, breath, and spirit. The Spirit is the lord; essence and breath are guests. I am the lord; the golden boy and jade maiden are guests. What is called three thousand six hundred divine maidens, and the thirty-six thousand spirits, these are all transformations of essence and breath. Now men’s hearts are like apes and horses, a thousand li in a day; how much more is essence wasted in lust? Breath exhausted in anger; furthermore, the eyes follow the colours, the ears are deceived by sounds; what profit accrues to oneself is small, but what is lost is countless. They know not that spirit’s light scatters abroad, breath’s force rushes in all directions; since essence and breath do not remain, would the golden boy and jade maiden still be at one’s side? Ten thousand spirits are one spirit, ten thousand breaths are one breath; from one arise ten thousand, embracing ten thousand return to one, all within my spirit.’

The true Master said: ‘Man’s one thought, when gathered, becomes spirit; when dispersed, becomes breath. When spirit gathers it is called the soul; when breath gathers it is called the corporeal soul. When man dies he is called ghost; the Yang is called soul; the Yin is called corporeal soul.’

The true Master said: ‘The Northern Dipper Scripture was not composed by the Highest; it was recorded by Zhang Zhengyi in the Han dynasty, who compiled the Highest’s meaning and made it into a Scripture. Now men do not understand its meaning, but merely look up to the stars and pay homage to the Dipper. The body has one breath, rising in the east and setting in the west, ascending and descending, like heaven and earth. Heaven and earth’s breath has Yin and Yang in daily alternation; men’s received breath is like this. The Northern Dipper in heaven turns night and day, dividing Yin and Yang and fixing the hours; therefore heaven and earth remain by it. Why not think who governs the breath within the human body? He who knows the governor knows the Northern Dipper within the body. The Scripture of the Dipper says: ‘If a home has the Northern Dipper Scripture, the six domestic animals prosper and increase.’ This is the Northern Dipper within the body which governs the breath; then the eyes do not desire to see, the ears do not desire to hear, the nose does not desire fragrance, the tongue does not desire taste, the body does not desire touch, the mind does not desire thought. Nourishing this essence, naturally the dwelling and children prosper.’

The true Master said: ‘The North Pole Demon-Driving Court originally had only four generals: Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou; now four more names have been added. The Plum Immortal Recall Court originally had only four generals: Pan, Geng, Lu, and Zha; now four more names have been added. These are additions of later men, not originally in the true law.’

The true Master said: ‘The ancient method’s officers used generals Huang and Liu; also used generals Gao and Ding; again used generals Jiao and Zeng; used also generals Sang and He; and Xu and Xie generals; all those received from their masters, none was without efficacy.’

The true Master said: ‘The Heavenly Heart Purple Script says: Three Origins in the Abyss, Five Elements in Blossom, Eight Trigrams in the Morning, Ten Directions in Truth. Now men practice the Eight Trigrams Morning method, yet move the character Shen; this is not to know its origin, perplexed by passing on perplexity, such there are.’

The true Master said: ‘Anciently there was no Fengdu method; at the end of the Tang dynasty Master Dayuanhao first transmitted this method to the world to summon ghosts and spirits. Within this method there are only eight generals, three talismans, four incantations, and the Fengdu General Register seal. Later men increased and added to it, too numerous and intricate; how can there be a correct law such as this?’

The true Master said: ‘The law clearly states the North Pole Demon-Driving Court, why is it called the Heavenly Mechanism Court? Therefore, the South Pole has the Heavenly Pivot Court; as in heaven’s left there is the Heavenly Pivot Province, and on the right the Heavenly Mechanism Province. The Green Heavenly Mechanism is the inner court of the North Pole; Demon-Driving is the outer court. The Heavenly Pivot is also the inner court of the South Pole; and the South Pole also has the Presentation Court outside. Asked: Man’s one thought can move heaven and earth; now when spells are sent, officers dispatched, and burnt to ash, they naturally ascend; why then do the six heavens’ demons and devils intercept and block? The answer: One thought’s sincerity, in accord with the Dao’s truth, can summon true spirits, without doubt! Anciently there was filial heart, sincerity, righteousness, compassion, firmness, loyalty; all moved heaven and earth in the questions of elbow-feeding. This is the one heart’s focus, one thought’s rectitude. Now men burn memorials to reach the imperial court; this is the ritual’s teaching. The sincerity of the heart’s thought is like an arrow shooting an object; the memorial’s response is like holding a spear to pierce. The arrow though distant arrives swiftly; the spear though near is hard to reach. Therefore memorials are tangible things where demons and devils can intercept. But the heart’s thought is intangible; how can demons and devils intercept it? The Master Liu Yuanchang asked: Man’s thoughts arise and vanish without ceasing; why then cannot these thoughts summon? The reply: Have you not seen a cat catching mice? It keeps its eyes fixed without blinking, its four feet crouched on the ground without moving; its heart is without distraction, its thought without wild imagining; its six roots face straight; head and tail are aligned; therefore all moves hit the mark.’

The true Master said: ‘When chaos was divided, the Three Powers were established; man dwells amid heaven and earth. Although small in form, his spirit is truly great; though lowly in shape, his spirit is truly high. Jade Toad went to the palace to present petitions; his memorials written like millet when on earth; in heaven their characters were like cups; at the start on earth, the paper was very small; at heaven’s central place, the memorials were over a zhang high and two zhang wide. Thus from this consider the Great Brahman’s Hidden Words, which say: The cloud qi gathers, over one zhang high; the Heavenly True Imperial Man guides the pen to write; such is the meaning. Formerly the Clear Source Record showed heavenly books upon the Dragon Pool; one inscription was black and red, shown by a carp. Changli explained: This is the Supreme Emperor’s record of slaying the dragon; its characters not more than one inch. Think of it in heaven, it is not only one inch. By present view, it is no other than that great heaven is great; what is transformed is great; what appears small is small. Like a man looking in a mirror: if the mirror is large, the face is large; if the mirror is small, the face is small. Henceforth all memorial papers should be one chi high, no more; characters like millet, no larger. This saying is not false.’ The Master Liu asked: ‘I have suspected refining and ordaining are two things; is this so?’ He replied: ‘The Scripture of Delivering Men says: Life-body receives ordination, that is one thing; and death-soul receives refining, that is another. Now viewing the Record of Zhu Ling Jingxian’s Ordination of Fate, it says: The Nanchang Palace governs two palaces: one called the Upper Palace, one the Lower Palace; the Upper Palace governs the affairs of refining, the Lower Palace governs those of ordaining. The living body dwells in the lower earth, hence under the Lower Palace; the death soul ascends to heaven, hence under the Upper Palace. Collectively called the Zhu Ling Fire Mansion, or the Nanchang Refining and Ordaining Office. Now men call the Nanchang Upper Official the Refiner-in-Chief; but the true official’s seal is used for the ordaining officer; this is without basis. Since it is said Nanchang Refining Office, but also named Upper Palace Refining Office, this too is without foundation. Now it is not necessary to speak of Upper or Lower Palace, nor of refining or ordaining; but simply that the Nanchang Refining and Ordaining Office uses its own seal, that is its origin. The seal reads: Seal of Nanchang Refining and Ordaining Office. Only the human double-seal, one chi three fen diameter.’ The Master Liu asked: ‘How is the presentation step?’ He replied: ‘The Gang step has many of Yu, Yu’s step is but five; it can combine the five elements, and long ascend. Generally the Gang step uses five steps, in accord with the five elements’ generation and conquest; the steps are like a cat or dog stalking a snake: five steps forward, five steps back; seven forward, seven back; all directions follow the number of the five elements’ generation; and when the snake crouches, then it strikes. Observe the crouching mouse likewise. Also the cat and dog stalking the snake, in advancing and retreating, may be struck or called by man; when it turns, the snake harms it. Thus the presentation step fails. Like the Eight Gates Escape and Hide method, the main thing is the Gang step’s spirit! Asked: The Yin and Yang Dipper of the world is in doubt. Answer: Now men begin with the left foot at the first star, from Kui to Bi, that is the Yang Dipper; begin with the right foot at the first star, from Tan to Po, that is the Yin Dipper. Mistaken indeed! This is an unfounded theory. The Scripture of Flying Spirits Visiting the Dipper says: Forward is Yang, backward is Yin; from Kui to Bi is forward; from Bi to Kui is backward. The main point says: If you wish to fly the spirit, do not offend the True Man; the True Man is the third star. Outside this all are Ding steps. Ding steps are treading; single steps are dots. If you say otherwise, I know not!’

Master Lu asked: ‘May one call generals with shouts?’ The answer: ‘Elders say: Respect them as lords and fathers, drive them as servants and messengers. Calling generals is spirit calling spirit. If man has no awe, the spirits are incomplete. When calling, one must hold the Highest’s mandate; then left and right call and rebuke as if they were present. Thus one may use one’s spirit to employ their spirits.’

The true Master said to Xiang: ‘Now simply wear one talisman, hold one office, practice one method, judge one bureau’s characters; before one bureau’s generals, use one talisman, one water; this is but the meeting of heart and spirit; use it and it is efficacious. Like a true dragon: but one drop of water, and it becomes torrential; why need so many? The Master Liu asked: ‘In recent times there are those who practice the Lingbao method, and say this method is lacking; again there are those who practice the Yuantong method, and say this method is lacking; again those who practice the Hun Yuan method, and say this method is lacking. Yet these many branches, and the numerous incantations, are not truly united in the Dao. Anciently teaching was by unity, therefore methods practiced were simple and easy. Now say Lingbao, how differs it from Yuantong? Say Yuantong, how differs it from Hun Yuan? Now Hun Yuan, how differs it from Zhengyi? Man’s heart is originally Yuantong, originally Lingbao, originally Zhengyi, originally Hun Yuan. From one man’s one heart flow infinite and endless methods, like the one breath of heaven that produces all things. And again say Hun Yuan is one stage, Lingbao is one stage, Yuantong is one stage, Zhengyi is one stage; like cuckoo and crow, or called Zigu, or Xiebao, or Baidi’s soul, or Ying Shan Hong, or Dao Yao bird, or Shu crow; in truth one cuckoo only.’

The true Master said: ‘All laws arise from the heart; outside the heart there is no other law.’ The Master Liu asked: ‘I have recently observed the side branches of the Lingbao method, also one called Yuantong, again one called the Highest Clarity Zhengming Court method, some use the seal of the Highest Clarity Moming Court, some the seal of Yuantong. The seal’s characters are Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi; the eight characters arrayed in the eight directions; within the seal further are the characters Si Yuan Sheng Fu; the characters within the seal are round, without square; this takes the meaning of Yuantong. In my humble opinion, Lingbao and Yuantong, Hunhua and Xuanmi, this is the heart seal. So may this wooden seal be used to make these eight characters? The so-called Si Yuan Sheng Fu is the spiritual platform; so may this wooden seal be used to make the Si Yuan Sheng Fu? Unaware that Lingbao is originally Yuantong, Yuantong is originally Lengming; why seek branches and leaves with such multiplicity? The answer: It is truly the Yuantong method, one seal made, but claiming Yuantong while not Yuantong. The Master Liu asked: ‘Does shamanic method have it? Its correctness no one distinguishes.’ The answer: ‘Shamanic method began with King Satan, passed to King Pangu, then to Asura King, then to Vito Shiwang, Changsha King, Toutuo King, Lushan Mountain at Luzhou Jiulang, Meng Mountain Qilang, Heng Mountain Shilang, Zhao Marquis Sanlang, Zhang Zhao Erlang; after this unknown how many. Formerly shamanic methods included Pangu method, Ling Mountain method, and Question Mountain method; in truth but one shamanic method. Shamanic method often steals words of the Highest; hence much use of Highest incantations. Most laughable is that ancient men inscribed the words ‘Highest in Heaven’ beneath the shamanic talisman in cursive; now shamans know not the meaning of the characters, but say the Great King is in the abyss. Ha! Ha!’ The Master Liu asked: ‘How of incantations and blessings in the law?’ The answer was: ‘The measure is the meaning of blessing. The meaning of blessing is to reach heaven, earth, and the divine spirits. If so, then worldly blessings of good and evil are responses. Now again not so—why? They do not know the meaning of measure. The well frog’s croaking disturbs the Great Pure, the hole ant’s noise alarms the Superior Spirit: these are like worldly blessings. How can blessings obtain response? Like incantations of the law, one is the proclamation of the Highest Golden Mouth; again, often they are the banners and flags of generals; the meaning of incantation depends on the law. Thus sigh, the generals follow it, the high perfected hear it. Now men’s chanting of incantations is ineffective; why? Because they do not examine the meaning of measure. The meaning of incantation values the heart’s presence and the eye’s thinking; then calling and summoning generals is as if the divine spirits were before you.’ The Master Liu asked: ‘The Scripture of Delivering from Suffering says: Thirty-six above heaven, thirty-six below earth, the Great Profound without bound, how wondrous the Great Cavern Scripture. Some say these are Yin and Yang two blacks, the seventy-two times; is this so?’ The answer: ‘This concerns the human body. The Mud Pellet represents heaven, belonging to Qian Qian number four; Qian metal Jiazi, metal number four, Qian uses nine. The Tail Gate represents earth, belonging to Kun, Kun number six, Kun uses six. Thus four nine is thirty-six, called above heaven; six six is thirty-six, called below earth. This means man’s head has thirty-six veins, and below the belly thirty-six networks; heaven and earth are likewise. But the human heart cannot be seen nor heard; hence it is said Great Profound without bound; how wondrous! Great cavern indeed.’ Master Lu asked: ‘There are five precepts, one is no drinking of wine. Yet wine does not harm the Dao; I fear it confuses the nature. Is wine to be forbidden?’ The answer: ‘The Collection of Scriptures of the Highest says: Talented and gifted ones indulge in wine; malt and hops inflame the heart, invert nature and feeling, break the ten good, arise the ten evils. The four passages are ruined, the six communications blocked.’

The true Master said to Xiang: ‘The female immortal E Lühua said to Yang Quan: Those who cultivate the Dao see brocade as filthy rags, see rank as a passing guest, see gold and jade as rubble. No thought, no care; no matter, no action; do what others cannot do, learn what others cannot learn, be diligent where others cannot, obtain what others cannot. Why? Because worldly men follow desires, I follow solitude; worldly men learn mundane affairs, I learn quietude; worldly men seek fame and profit, I seek inward practice; worldly men gain old age and death, I gain longevity.’ The true Master said: ‘The ancients said: Wisdom surpasses the master, then worthy to instruct; wisdom equals the master, then the master’s virtue is halved. Moreover the Book says: The master labours and the work is halved; the master is at ease and the work is doubled. This is so.’

The Master said: ‘All earthly things only the mercury and the brain cannot be faked. Teaching compares essence to mercury, calling it ‘quicksilver’; calls the brain marrow; mercury flies easily, brain flees easily. Even if mercury and brain are sealed in secret places, there is something to draw them forth; if they fly away, they lose their place, like pepper penetrating quicksilver. Now men’s essence and marrow are mostly captured by lust, till dried and exhausted. Alas!’

The true Master said: ‘Former Master Chen Nijiu, once at Hui Temple, met the Great Cavern True Man Sun Jun, who said: Formerly the Primordial Heavenly Lord and the Highest Old Lord spoke scriptures, gathered and compiled, forming one treasury. Such as the Northern Dipper Scripture, Southern Dipper Scripture, Disaster Dispelling Scripture, Constant Pure Scripture, Heavenly Child Scripture, Lingbao Delivering Man Scripture, all issued by the Jade Emperor Heavenly Lord, with real trace of events. Xiang asked: Now what of the teaching called Yoga? The reply: Their teaching says it is the remaining teaching of Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni transformed into Vajra of Filthy Traces, descended as Brahma King with snail curl; thus this teaching spread, subduing demons, curbing heterodox ways; but only the thirty-three syllables of the Golden Wheel Filthy Trace Incantation. Yet their teaching has Nagarjuna the Healing King to aid it! Besides this there are the two great saints of Fragrant Mountain and Snow Mountain; the two great saints of Pig Head and Elephant Nose; the two great saints of Heroic Might and Radiant Light; and Prince Navana, King Dingshu, and Shen of the Depths, God Jieti to assist their method; thus there are the Vajra warriors as assistants, called generals, only four: Tiger-faced, Horse-faced, Ox-headed, and Golden-headed; no others. Now heterodox masters mix the words of various ways; yet step the Gang, twine the secret hand signs, shout loud, dance wildly; shake bells and gongs, whip hemp snakes, strike peach rods, yet greatly lose the true ancient teaching. This does not seem Shakyamuni’s doing! Yet Yoga is one of the Buddhist methods of subduing demons. Xiang asked: In the countryside many are vegetarian and fast, to serve the bright teaching, calling it demon extinguishing. Their followers also say it is the remaining teaching of the Highest Old Lord; is this so or not? The answer: Formerly in the Kingdom of Su Lin there was a layman called Mu Ge, who first studied immortality but failed, then studied Buddhism without acceptance, and retired to Danao Mountain; there he met foreign teachers of the Western Heaven, one day Vipaka the Bright Messenger taught him a method to practice, so he retained this one teaching. In truth it is not right. Their teaching has one prohibition: All great lands and rivers, plants and trees, water and fire, all are the Dharmakaya of Vairocana Buddha, so they dare not tread or move. Yet even so it is outside Vairocana Buddha’s body. Like holding the eight fasts and bowing to the five directions, only teaching and precepts make it so. Their teaching has one: Heavenly King, two: Bright Messenger, three: Spirit Appearance Landlord, to govern their teaching. The main thing is clear contesting brightness, great strength and wisdom, these eight characters only. Yet these eight characters are nothing beyond the heart. Now men dress in signs to cultivate practice, but would exhaust these eight characters; can they? Moreover, the bright teaching is dimmed.’

The true Master said: ‘Sometimes ordinary, sometimes holy, like shadow following form; one is infinite, infinite is one. Like sun and moon reflected in many waters; sun and moon’s light have no distinction, following water’s rise, chasing the eye’s view. One water has a thousand eyes, a thousand suns and moons; one water one eye, one sun one moon; a thousand waters one eye, one sun one moon; a thousand waters a thousand eyes, a thousand suns a thousand moons; like shadow following form, it is thus. Take or not take, neither is good; neither take nor leave, also not to be had.’ Xiang asked: ‘Worldly talk mentions Yin Pill and Yang Pill, are these external or internal pills?’ The answer: ‘External pills are hard to refine and fail; internal pills are easy to refine and succeed. What is called Yin Pill and Yang Pill is the internal pill. Pill means heart; heart means spirit. Yang spirit is called Yang Pill; Yin spirit is called Yin Pill; in fact both are internal pills. To transform the body, outside the body is another body; gathered it forms shape, dispersed it becomes darkness; this is the Yang spirit. One thought clear and pure, the soul’s consciousness not dispersed, like dream or shadow, akin to ghost; this is the Yin spirit. Now those who cultivate pills, must know this.’

The true Master told Master Liu: ‘The Red Spirit Jade Script says: Eastern Extreme Precious Blossom, Western Extreme Supreme Clarity, Northern Extreme Demon Driving, Southern Extreme Heavenly Pivot; these are the Four Extremes, and the Central Extreme the Five Thunders truly govern the Four Extremes. Now the Capital Heavenly Thunder all issue from the Divine Firmament Jade Pivot, called the Great Radiant Thunder. Though below Divine Firmament, it is the Primordial’s station. Formerly the Heavenly True dispatched the fierce officer Xin Hanchen of the Wolf Tooth Thunder Division, who gave it to Former Master Chen Cuixu; Cuixu passed it on to me; now I entrust it to you; you should keep it secret.’

The true Master said: ‘Spirit returns vast as Sumeru is small, Qi enters void and is as broad as a mustard seed.’

The true Master told Xiang: ‘You say the Eleven Luminaries Incantation is truly the Highest’s words; is this clear?’ He replied: ‘Truly so!’ He said: ‘Ha! In that incantation it says Gan Stone pushes flow and subdues; but Gan De and Shi Shen are all stellar elders, men of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States. Gan Shi was not yet born; this scripture existed earlier. Consider this, is it Highest’s words? Ha!’

The true Master told Master Liu: ‘You say the world’s Hun Yuan Ruyi method is true?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Ha! In that method is an incantation saying: Northern Pole Blessed True Lord’s decree; also Three Heavens Assist Teaching Great Master’s decree. If so, then doubtful. Blessed True is a man of the Zhou dynasty; Heavenly Master is from the Han. If this Hun Yuan method was before the Highest, it should not use the Highest Old Lord’s decrees; still less Blessed True and Heavenly Master! Why so? Because it is Hun Yuan. Ha!’

Master Lu asked: ‘Recently I heard the Yuantong method; I secretly doubted it. Their method seal has round inside, square outside; within are the five elements; without the eight trigrams; provincial, bureau, service, court arranged in four directions; with the four characters Lingbao Yuantong as the sect, and the four characters Hunhua Xuanmi as the root. Within it they collect various method talismans, charts, incantations, creating one school, called the Great Yuantong Method. Master, do you approve?’ He said: ‘God has no form, hence round; Qi has no body, hence flowing. Anciently the saying of Yuantong meant spirit and qi mixed and mingled, entering and exiting the void, returning to chaos. Now if one takes form, apparatus, trigrams and numbers as it, how far is this from true Yuantong!’

The true Master said to Xiang: ‘Do you know the two envoys Qingyang and Tuo Luo of the Dipper?’ He said: ‘Pray tell their explanation.’ He said: ‘Qingyang is a character on earth; in heaven it is the master of good sound; Tuo Luo is a human word; in heaven it is the character for capital. The envoy Qingyang holds a jade bottle and golden lotus; the envoy Tuo Luo holds a golden tray and white crowned incense burner. The vulgar interpretation is mistaken!’

The true Master said: ‘Former Master said: There is great joy in the human world. Yet pleasure and pain eternally circle; joy does not last a hundred years, but may last ten thousand kalpas. Now in the world some guard money for death, others seek death for money; never have I seen a man contend life for money, but not money for life. Alas!’

The true Master told Master Liu: ‘Do you know all the methods I speak of are heart methods?’ He said: ‘I know.’ He said: ‘What is heart?’ He said: ‘I know not.’ He said: ‘Since you do not know, how do you practice?’ He said: ‘All that has form is none other than heart method.’ He said: ‘Go on practicing, and after long time you will know; knowing is not knowing, not knowing is knowing. Though you do not know, is it not like knowing?’ Upon hearing these words, Xiang and Master Liu leapt in grief and awe, greatly awakened. Hai Qiong laughed and rose.

### Expression of Gratitude for Transmission of Ordination  
By the High Lord of the Divine Firmament Jade Pure Court, Commander of Thunder, over the Five Thunder Generals, directing the Thunder Capital Office’s ghosts and spirits’ affairs, your servant Yu Chan reports: On the fifteenth day of this month, I humbly serve as the Western Terrace Officer of the Jade Pure Mansion of the Supreme Clarity Taihua Danjing Office of the Divine Firmament, acting immortal capital Wind-Thunder Judge; your servant Peng Xiang, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Mysterious Capital Sanjing Master, Taiyi Thunder Registrar, Nine-Spirit Flying Step Immortal Official, signing the various courts’ ghosts and spirits’ affairs; your servant Liu Yuanchang, Supreme Highest Zhengyi Alliance Might Master, serving Demon-Driving Court Judge, Nanchang Registrar, Nine-Spirit Flying Step Immortal Official, also managing Thunder Capital Office’s ghosts and spirits’ affairs; your servant Lin Boqian, Supreme Highest Three-Five Capital Official Register, Divine Firmament Jade Mansion Right Attendant Scripture; your servant Pan Changji, Supreme Highest Three-Five Capital Official Register, Divine Firmament Jade Mansion Right Attendant Scripture; your servant Zhou Xiqing, Supreme Highest Three-Five Capital Law Register disciple, implementing Heavenly Heart True Law Demon-Driving Court Judge, also managing Five Thunder Messenger Office affairs; your servant Hu Shijian, Supreme Highest Zhengyi Alliance Might Master, practicing Supreme Clarity Hun Yuan Heavenly Heart Five Thunder Great Law, assigned to manage Demon-Driving Court affairs, also Thunder Capital Office affairs; your servant Luo Zhida, Supreme Highest Three-Five Capital Purple Void Yang Light Secret Register disciple, practicing Supreme Clarity Northern Pole Heavenly Heart True Law Golden Niche Inner Terrace Refining Ordination Registrar, Demon-Driving Court Right Judge; your servant Chen Shoumo, Supreme Highest Zhengyi Alliance Might Master, practicing Lingbao Heavenly Heart Jade Morning Five Thunder Great Law Nine-Spirit Flying Step Immortal Official, managing Demon-Driving Yellow Register Court affairs; your servant Zhuang Zhirou and others, entrusted with Dao methods, respectfully submit this memorial to the palace, giving thanks for heavenly grace. Humbly, as the law has true transmission, fortunate to inherit master’s instruction, office not given in vain, hoping to repay heavenly grace. Dare to take this private petition, controlling the knot within. We are but insects like cicadas and ants, what can we know? Unworthily compiling the vanished China, truly arising from Great Jun’s creation. Relying on heaven and earth’s support, bearing sun and moon’s illumination, sitting and eating with shame, what merit have we with things? Reflecting on vast kalpas till this life, having this body now, enduring three evils and unvirtuous acts, killing, stealing, licentiousness; six roots ignorant; greed, anger, ignorance, love; sins as vast as the sea, karma heavy as mountains. Thanks to the Highest True One opening the door to repentance, giving dumb creatures the way to explain, removing former offenses and curbing yet unarisen disasters. Yet still turning away from returning, truly burdened by shaping and casting; early green contract with the Way, encountering Divine Firmament Five Thunder’s Scripture; all rare immortals receiving the Highest Nine Spirits’ commission. Thus able to hold the seal in the palm, with brush flying talisman, commanding wind and thunder, distinguishing men and ghosts, saving lives and delivering death, aiding righteousness and removing evil. How could we fall into the mortal world’s troubles, dare to fly step upon Kui Gang? Anciently transmitted, now thus practiced, inwardly refining the blade and jade, outwardly storing merit and practice, embodying heaven and carrying out transformation, assisting state and saving people. Respectfully considering the High Lord Divine Firmament Jade Pure True King, the Longevity Great Emperor, whose Dao is hard to name, whose virtue is broad and vast, father and mother of all beings, ruler of the kings and the moon’s teacher. Leading the Nine Streams before myriad bright ones, governing the Eight Extremes above the great space, compassionate in saving the world, skillful in delivering men. Your servant carves the tablet of the East Terrace, arranges the toilet in the West Mansion, lectures on the regulations of talismans and broken bonds, imitates the enemy’s blood drinking and pill ritual, swears to command generals and officers, establishing great merit, all relying on talismans and charts to expound the great teaching. Sincerely reflecting and deeply attesting, true Yin secretly faithful, wishing to clear the dust of sea and mountains, to lock the demon’s cave, so as to open the void’s breach, again raise the Zhengyi’s wind. Acting amid heavenly might, following imperial mandate, if granted protection, may arrangements be fulfilled. The body is not yet completely true; the embryo blacker still with jade black; spirit enters the marvel, heaven’s heart accepts the roaming heaven. We humbly submit this memorial to report. Truly respectful and fearful. Prostrated! Saluting! Twice bowed, respectfully speaking.  
Year of the Earth Tiger, Jiading eleventh year, tenth month, day appointed, your servant Yu Chan submits.

### Three Quatrains of Divine Firmament Song  
Vast and distant is the divine firmament sky, when will the jade capital dawn?  
Jade flowers dew-wet medicine, rare trees’ wind moans in branches.  
Jade consorts attend the cloud book, feather boys dance with golden hairpins;  
Alas, men of the world, red dust wasted day after day.  
Purple jade flies to the clear capital, green clouds guard the red palace;  
No stars are seen, only sun and moon look down.  
In the next world two thousand years, dare not tell men,  
I have become a golden pill, leaving behind the flying immortal formula.  
Jade Emperor’s incense attendant, Golden Pavilion gate keeper,  
Precious furnace cooks sun and moon, iron ruler lashes thunder.  
Morning refines western mountain clouds, night before the Northern Dipper star,  
South city reports the tree spirit, my home is in the jade capital.  
My master Hai Qiong, flying bestowed between Kang and Lu;  
Jiading Earth Tiger spring, with writings promising meeting at Wuyi,  
You as clan’s screen, carrying the order to the capital, summer going and autumn returning, bargaining for the alliance boat, lost beyond seeking.  
Thus I leave these three quatrains to mark.  
Once said: Lady Zhou Xiqing linked the horses to tour.  
That year Double Ninth, Zi Yuanzi Liu Yuanchang’s son good at writing.  
Before Zhi’an Hermitage’s Nine-Bend Creek, I came leaning on the oar facing the slanting sun,  
Meeting men asking if the master returned; only saw dragons and snakes flying on the wall.  
True Master’s silent tracks move between the walls.  
Flying steps seek the bone-changing cliff, leaving only old skins buried in the border box.  
Zi Yuan is not without immortal share, what matter who guides?  
This morning just the Double Ninth, wind in the cave blows sweet-scented osmanthus,  
Together with Lady Xiqing picking chrysanthemums, returning with a cup full of nine clouds.

### Flying Immortal Gifted to Zi Yuan  
Riding jade turtle at night to gather bright moon,  
Medicine hall Yao terrace cold to the bone,  
Thirty-six heavens do not close their gates, wind blows rare flowers spreading scattered flakes.  
Who is the wailer among the guards?  
Eighty thousand rainbow robes sing white snow,  
Purple Emperor’s feast done, carriage just leaves,  
Adjust clothes neat and simple, goes to court to salute.  
Fire bell general shouts once,  
Left and right ten thousand true spirits raise their hair,  
Announcing: Your servant is Thunder official, formerly exiled for crime, leaves the pill palace.  
Red dust buries the body up to the ears,  
Eating green drinking blue guarding bitter integrity,  
Flying spirit ascends heaven coming to quench thirst,  
Asking if emperor has wine to seek a sip,  
Envoy drunk once lets servant return.  
Returning to the human world to tell men,  
Below Phoenix Pavilion asks the way home,  
Jade boys and jade maidens ask the child,  
Heavenly day long Supreme Clarity void,  
Human world like here none?  
Shakes head without answer, brushes sleeves,  
White clouds dim obscure the Clear Capital,  
Monkeys and cranes in the cave recognize each other again,  
White stone rots and green pine withers.

### Thirty Poems of Huayang  
My home lies ten thousand li away on Qiongya,  
This body comes and goes like a solitary boat,  
By night dreams chase the west wind away,  
Eyes break on home mountains, tears flow voidly.  
Hainan is a stretch of watery clouded sky,  
Looking far born flowers already ten years,  
Suddenly at one or two hours turning back,  
West wind and sunset choke the sorrowful cicada.  
Since leaving the ship at Hainan,  
My body follows clouds flying to Jiangzhe sky,  
Running all over caves and heavens seeking hermits,  
Not knowing how many straw sandals spent.  
White clouds accompany me to Tiantai,  
Eyes enter green mountains and mind is open,  
Arriving at the mountain, rises again,  
Only to cause night apes to wail everywhere.  
Leaning on staff seeking body entering Wuyi,  
Under Slow Pavilion snowflakes fly,  
Journeying from Nine-Bend Beach watch,  
Ten thousand valleys and thousand stones green enclose.  
Wuyi tied grass more than two years,  
Flowers laugh and orioles sing, spring one pot,  
Water flows down mountain, men emerge from caves,  
Before the rock only the pill-refining furnace.  
Having received the formula return to test refining,  
Dragons fight tigers in a moment,  
Nine Flowers in heaven know the gain,  
One night wind and thunder shakes ten thousand mountains.  
White horse at river’s mouth whistles once,  
Red light purple mist arises in water,  
Quickly draws the green snake sword from the box,  
Just clears the Yellow River thoroughly.  
Thirst quenched with golden waves several hundred cups,  
Drunkenly wielding sword points at the void,  
Feet play trample the Kui Dipper,  
Long shout once, heaven and earth blush.  
Move the Northern Dipper past the Southern Star,  
Both hands hold sun and moon wheels,  
Flying to Kunlun Mountain’s summit,  
In a moment transforms into a day’s cloud.  
Playing drifting golden boat reaches sea’s end,  
Darkly following sea water crosses drifting sand,  
Once landing on Penglai shore,  
Going to see jade terrace garden flowers.  
Man’s body has its own Penglai,  
Twelve layers of white jade steps,  
Jade boat ever moored, always at meeting,  
Before the hall night after night peonies bloom.  
Strange things cause man to laugh several times,  
Now men can conceive,  
Their own essence and blood mate,  
Body wrapped as husband and wife, how wondrous!  
One chant one drunken one jade tablet,  
True qi true essence fills four limbs,  
If reaching drunken deep sleep,  
The whole boat loads treasures crossing Cao Creek.  
Original spirit nightly dwells in cinnabar field,  
Cloud fills Yellow Court, moon fills the sky,  
Two mandarin ducks float on green water,  
Water’s heart a purple-golden lotus.  
Hungry eat a piece of black turtle liver,  
Cold towards cinnabar field fierce fire mountain,  
Only seeing no point in the heart,  
Not knowing the mortal world has hunger and cold.  
Blue ox man gone how many years,  
This way clearly before us,  
If you wish to know the true place in front,  
One hall wind cold moon bright.  
In a moment’s work refine mercury and bismuth,  
A furnace fierce fire burns the night sky,  
Suddenly divine water falls into golden well,  
Meeting spirit sand round as the moon.  
A pool of divine water fills the splendid pond,  
Night after night beside pond white snow flies,  
Snow wraps one catching jade rabbit,  
Driving the bright moon onto cold branch.  
Not moving a whit beyond the jade pass,  
At the pass naturally is Jade Capital Mountain,  
Able within the mountain to communicate coming and going,  
Wind stirs nine heavens frost snow cold.  
Who knows the Great Heaven Creation’s work,  
Now pressed into a moment,  
Only take lead and mercury into true soil,  
Refine to golden flower full cauldron red.  
Last night at third watch thunder shook the mountain,  
Nine heavens’ gates not once closed,  
On Cao Creek road clearly seen,  
There is a golden crow entering the vast cold.  
Cao Creek road passes the mud pellet,  
Only between cinnabar field above and below,  
Loosening the golden elder to match bride and groom,  
Morning clouds evening rain fill Wushan.  
Only take Earth and Fire as pill furnace,  
Refining red pill turns to jade paste,  
Slowly guarding fire line three hundred days,  
Produces a luminous pearl.  
Jiang Yuexian Capital one scattered youth,  
Occasionally comes to the human world feigning madness,  
Within the body has longevity treasure,  
Nightly flying spirit visits the Supreme Heaven.  
Home lies in Divine Firmament Nine Black Heavens,  
Heavenly palaces store many immortals,  
Occasionally coming to the human realm,  
Thinking Divine Firmament not yet a year.  
Beneath Jade Emperor’s hall one immortal boy,  
Once managed talismans and guarded medicine palace,  
Because worldly ties not yet severed,  
Now illusion body enters worldly cage.  
Qi covers mountains and rivers, heart and courage bold,  
Cannot learn sword not study books,  
At night stirring heaven and earth,  
Fire degree warm warm guards jade furnace.  
Dream and illusion body not long lasting,  
How long can mulberry and elm endure wind and frost?  
Better to jump into the cave of fame and gain,  
Giving you the formula for longevity and immortality.  
Playing with poems and wine’s miraculous power,  
Hiding poetry and wine from men’s eyes,  
Coming and going in the red dust over some winters.

### Inscription at Tianqing Temple  
Bought a leaf boat on Lujiao River,  
Fame and profit like wax, enough, enough!  
I will not drag tail to beg pity,  
Early make heart grey, not plan office.  
Already learned lacquer garden to plough with Bai Zhao,  
Willing to be county magistrate waiting on blue ox,  
About the jade tablet what matter who knows,  
Bright moon and pure wind nod their heads.

### Inscription at Yue Temple  
From the south one sword halts three mountains,  
Divided life’s wind and moon fear,  
Who governs Jingyang should apply medicine,  
Originally seek water clock to cultivate pill.  
Meng Zhuang yet yearns for lacquer garden’s emolument,  
Old man Li once was officer under pillar,  
I regard glory as truly accustomed to see,  
How better to early refine green Lang Jie.

### Flying Swallow Flies to Splendid House  
Far gaze on Divine Firmament Road,  
Dipper ladle south, Danhua green scene,  
Red clouds purple mist.  
Hand plucks jade flower now like dream,  
Twelve towers where?  
Still remember then with companion singer.  
East Mansion West Terrace who knows who rules?  
Recall then, pouring golden bottle,  
Between two persons, like floating willow fluff.  
Supreme Emperor majestic Thunder Lord.  
I why green, Clear Capital Red Palace become eternal?  
White crane blue crow news cut off,  
Dreaming phoenix song and phoenix dance.  
Should not have gained freedom return,  
Karmic debts must be repaid all,  
This once taste the red dust’s bitterness.  
Raise return like West Queen Mother.

Again  
Moon inserted in blue snail hairpin,  
Willow tip, sunset fading,  
West wind sways.  
Several grains of Cang Mountain withered far Han,  
Tree color smoke light purple green.  
Flying rider half awake half drunk.  
Sword hip autumn sky sharpens stars and dipper,  
Points to jade boy, cannot sound golden bridle.  
Fear to startle purple clear emperor.  
Floating clouds fly over Penglai water.  
Recall mountain midst, pine cold dew chill,  
Apes cry and cranes shriek.  
Home in Wuyi rock valley wrap,  
One mu smoke and clouds livelihood.  
Sigh burning finger, life hundred years.  
Orchid bowl ganoderma field how now and ancient?  
Cave gate before little deer watches flowers play.  
Do not know there are men asking the world.

### Gift to Medicine Pearl Attendant Pan Changji  
One speck of red dust provokes into the heart,  
Medicine pearl hall drops lost hairpin,  
At that time together descending Yao Terrace road,  
Only now Peng Helin.

### Gift to Purple Flower Attendant Zhou Xiqing  
Raised head arched brows heavenly man,  
Unknowing what matter comes to red dust,  
Divine Firmament medicine book now who serves,  
Purple mansion jade flower dares not spring.  
No dream go to attend Queen Mother’s feast,  
Past life mostly purple void body,  
Send word to seek Penglai road,  
Wind sends twin phoenix to Supreme Radiance.

## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume the Second

Compiled by Disciples Fuzhou Tianqing Temple Supervisors and Supreme Daoist Purple Light Lin Boqian and others  
### Words of the Crane Forest Method  
In Jiading Renwu year at the Lantern Festival, Patriarch Hai Qiong wrote to Ordaining Master of Crane Forest from Zhejiang to Fujian, for the Ordaining Master of Crane Forest’s father, former Ministry official Mr. Juefei, practicing Yellow Register affairs. At daybreak arrived at Zhi; the Ordaining Master with incense in sleeve, advanced, knelt long in salute. His words were: ‘Living in Fujian, since the Master departed, day and night on the road, no one dares neglect. What did Heaven say? It took the estimate of Xiang; presently submitted record to the provincial path marshal; and the estimate has fallen; I pray the Master’s compassion. Truly at the time of collapse, wind and thunder flew and howled, the entire house fragrant and different; outside the door clear day, people heard nothing; seeming different from other deaths. When buried, continuous rain for days stopped suddenly, burial done, rain again. Locals knew and found it strange. Xiang presumptuously used Yellow Register to wash; now Master has come down, this Yellow Register affair is realized. The three realms are fortunate! Myriads of spirits rejoice! The Patriarch said: ‘You need not be over ceremonious; today is just the Lantern Festival; quickly order building the pure hall, establish jade chest office, and set up Yellow Register office. From dawn till late afternoon, documents completed; announce and pledge to heaven and earth; plant huge banner at gate. Order Xu Yi Zhao Rukuai as chief worker; Purple Shaft Lin Shizhong as capital lecturer; Purple Light Lin Boqian as monitor fasting herbs; Fang Hao Jing’an as scripture attendant; Jade Spirit Deng Daoning as incense attendant; Jade Flower Chen Milong as lamp attendant; Purple Pot Xie Xiandao as altar attendant; Purple Qiong Zhao Shoufu as director of guards; I take charge as Supreme Clarity Yellow Register officer, as chief supervisor. On last day of first month, fill posts; first day of second month begin affairs, fourth day complete festival, then thank grace; fifth day sacrifice thunder. All fasting and festival affairs use ancient style, nine morning meals as usual ceremony.’

The Ordaining Master agreed.

On second day of second month, Gengchen day, early, heavy rain as if poured; from first day rain continued three days; wind and rain dark; in three days and nights, nine meals. Just as one led the guards to court, suddenly clearing; after court resumed rain; all nine meals likewise. Second day, Xin Si day at dusk, submitted memorial; people feared rain; as the memorial was submitted, rain stopped suddenly; clouds gathered all around; only on the altar the North Star shone brightly; without the altar rain fell as if knowing. When the event ended, rain poured on the altar; spectators rejoiced. The Patriarch said: ‘Dark and clear are heavenly affairs; accidental only; why fear or rejoice?’

On third day, Renwu long day, someone at own temple saw it, knowing it was prior spirit’s coming. The Ordaining Master rejoiced and reported; Patriarch quickly stopped him, saying: ‘Hear it as it is. The Great Way has no form; does not value shadow or image. Law is the use of Dao! Can bring darkness and light. Now who has sights? What wonder? Asked: After festival welcoming true, announcing pardon, clear as before festival, only the first and last nine meals, why is rain so continuous?’

The Patriarch said: ‘Ancient and modern Yellow Register building often clouded; because ghosts suffer cold and heat, coming from the dark gate; this also is effect of summoning. On seventh day Bingxu summon all gods and officers, and sacrifice thunder. Ceremony done, place the sacrificed beasts and wine dried meat on southeast earth, bury the cinnabar talisman; agree to three days thunder howling, dig talisman to rest Crane Forest peace. That year because last winter no rain, wheat sowing hard, meet this Yellow Register, soil fat moist.’

After the festival, give thanks at fasting palace; spirits and officers speak of merit.

The Ordaining Master expressed thanks: ‘Master’s festival affairs, this land’s people have not seen; and Xiang’s gains are many! And wet the sentient beings are not few. Acting according to rules and steps, medicine heals men’s hearts, seeing what never seen, illuminating past and future. But Master hears all reports of divine wonders, all he stops; why? Because accidental only; why need rejoice? I also do not rejoice their presence, nor worry their absence; only know to act the Dao and serve the Law, letting it follow nature. Therefore with sincerity to penetrate its effects, relying on law to carry out affairs. How could I fear or rejoice therein? To foster such thought would rob me of right thought.’

Asked: ‘What is the meaning of the Yellow Register?’ The Patriarch said: ‘Nine Netherworlds extract sin, there is Golden Register and White Tablet; Golden Register is Yellow Register; hence Above Heaven also establishes Yellow Register Court. Yellow is the ancestor of all colours; Register is the talisman of all true ones. This means yellow contains principle and qi, governs all true ones, passes from dark to light, saves life and delivers death. Register also means recording, recording ghosts and spirits’ registers. Yellow means governing, governing ghosts and spirits’ affairs. The netherworld ghosts and spirits have governance and control, and are charged with recording.’

The Ordaining Master asked: ‘The Dipper is the imperial chariot, moving the center; presiding over four directions, observing demons and auspices. The Scripture says: Central Dipper Great Leader governs all spirits. Also the Scripture says: Northern Dipper seven stars are great gods in heaven. The Book of Lu says: Like the North Star, with all stars circling it. If so, then the Dipper Pole is the unparalleled image, because it governs the starry river. Some say the Dipper is in the center of heaven, thus called Northern Dipper; why so? Know not that the Dipper handle points from Zi to Hai, night and day always turning, all the time north, hence called Northern Dipper. The so-called Southern Dipper among the twenty-eight lodges is only the northern lodges’ leader; it is not the Northern Dipper. Recently men are confused by the Southern Dipper’s name; those who draw its image paint it red; and place it above the Northern Dipper; great error indeed!’

Some say: ‘The Dipper lodges are in the twenty-eight lodges’ degrees, located in the north; why then called Southern Dipper?’ Know not that the jade disc is in the north but called Eastern Disc; the well is in the south but called Eastern Well; this may be understood by analogy. How then is this reason?’

The Patriarch said: ‘If so indeed! According to the Celestial Map and Armillary Sphere, and old and new step calculations, none mention Southern Dipper above the Northern Dipper, nor is there the name Southern Dipper. This is only Daoism’s so-called six Southern Dipper officials; perhaps hidden stars in the sky; also impossible to inspect. According to the law book there is a Southern Dipper Secret Warning saying so-and-so belongs to the South Pole, Zhu Ling’s Fire Department Fire Bell Office; also a Southern Dipper Inner Warning saying: Zha Na Ban Qu Da Hei, this is the so-called Southern Dipper. If one wishes to obliterate it, what of the scriptures?’

The Ordaining Master asked: ‘The Five Planets and Six Luminaries have flowing, hiding, invading, rebellious, corroding movements; truly the source of disaster and misfortune. Those who remove disaster and deliver from calamity must report and inform. Is informing allowed? Must the informing be established with images and have its lamp? According to the Golden Register Essentials: All lamps have forms. But only this lamp’s form is not established; is it not lost? Because Luo Ji Zibo is in the sky, and is a hidden luminary; it is hidden; this is manifest. What means this?’

The Patriarch said: ‘Like the Northern Dipper lamp form; the Right Assistant Star is also a hidden luminary; it does not desire a lamp; only eight lamps are there. Luo Hou is the remnant qi of fire; Ji Du is the remnant qi of earth; Yu Bo is the remnant qi of metal and water; Zi Qi is the remnant qi of wood. Now only the eleven luminaries’ lamps remain, held by the four stars; no need for lamp; this suffices!’

The Ordaining Master said: ‘Before the Han Heavenly Master ascended, he said to men: If there be two sheng of Dipper rice, I take it as example; like Confucius walking with tied bundle and above, I have never failed to teach. Hence then called Dipper Rice Master. Now men often quote the Scripture of Delivering Men saying: The supreme scholar has treasure, pledges heart to heaven and passes on. Yet greedily take bribes, and still wish to prepare altar ceremonies. Why? Because all hard to part with, none more than own wealth; hence say food is heaven, wealth is life. So ordering to bring gold treasures and lingzhi cloth is specially to cut what is hard to part with, to see true sincerity. If in the midst a greed thought arises, this is losing the original intent!’

Again said: ‘One altar festival is weighted by memorials; if the master conducting has true knowledge and spirit, then the memorials all reach. Hence at the start of welcoming true, there is proclamation and reproach; after sending true, there is burning memorial. In Xiangnian’s year, after welcoming true and proclaiming, they yet bring memorials out into the courtyard to burn. Also, after welcoming true at north, proclaiming memorial at here, yet bringing memorial out and burning it; why? This shows that the master conducting has no fixed thought; it must be so!’

The Patriarch said: ‘The Lingbao Jade Mirror says: The migrating spirit banner, its colour uses calf leather; on both sides are the Three Pure Ones’ divine names; the banner body says Migrating Spirit Banner; now though the banner colour is the same, size differs, and seal script differs. Confusing migrating and spirit, calling it treasure banner, is mistaken. Also anciently two banners were placed inside the nine sufferings and nine prisons’ lamp wheel; when summoning and capturing, again placed before incense and music; these two banners all have use. Now not so; set upright at the doorhead, only for show; ignorant of their use! Like Taiwei returning the yellow flag, though flag has form, without the spirit command banner, the banner form exists. Now all do not know why; some rub flags, nearly beyond distinguishing.’

Again said: ‘According to Yellow Register’s law and regulations, when summoning the dead souls, one must make good thoughts to transcend and deliver; one must not wail and weep to injure spirit. The law officers proceed in advance, warning this strictly; warnings not strict, punish as law. This is true ordination of the dead’s meaning. Man is greedy for life, hates death; this is human feeling. If one cannot harmonize life and death, who can forget death? Because one thought still remains, so cannot be free. Thus Highest ordination’s intent is first to destroy the evil thought of death. Now it is not so; not only forbid grief and wailing, but cleverly allow former acceptance, guiding to make weep; by this influencing, confusion grows more.’

Again said: ‘The Divine Firmament Five Thunder Great Law says: Upper Three Origins Three Heaven Lord White Tablet, this is one; Middle Origin Golden Book, Nine Heaven Precious Edict, this is one; Lower Origin Ascending True Ordination of Fate, Escape from Life and Death talisman, this is one. Tablets, talismans, edicts, registers though named differently, all serve Highest to save and deliver sentient beings. Now taking the report of command as the report of body; the white tablet and ascending true talisman all listed; given to the dead. What use do they have?’

Again said: ‘Delivering from suffering and longevity two talismans, greatly efficacious; since called Original Symbol talisman of fate, can they be lightly treated? Therefore the Road True Officer petitions, and when talismans are made, secretly sends to Three Officers and Thirty-Six Prisons. Now not so; their writings not petitioned, their making not secretly sent; all entrusted to others’ hands; senior officers all not involved! The world transmits saying these two talismans have some power to ordain the dead; each ordains one name, must give one tablet, ten or hundred or thousand or ten thousand, all counted; dare not omit. I have often thought the white tablet is wood, red text vermilion; if white wood red vermilion can ordain the dead, then in the nine springs below, none is not ordained. Alas! Spirit and brightness depend on the person; if not the person, the Dao does not act in vain. If all were true and spirit-reached ones, sincere to save and deliver death, then even one talisman one tablet could ordain ten thousand souls abundantly!’

Again said: ‘According to the Ancient Ritual and Continued Ritual’s recorded formats, this is to give later men basis. Now not so; one ritual all the text copied from ancient edition, not daring to alter a character. If so, then ancient men who hid the tablets could all recall the words within; is that difficult? Hiding tablets, bowing to tablets, preserving tablets, all one meaning. If cannot do so, then say burn the tablets is enough! Yet entrust generals, talisman officers, functionaries to deliver. If setting festival to present memorial, each divides its office, desiring their specialization. Therefore heart without distraction, body without miscellaneous affairs, holding origin guarding unity, like Road True Officer’s ‘leave festival seven days, no festival matters may interfere,’ then can proceed. Now not so; some morning attend funeral but at evening submit memorial; some substitute master submit memorial without changing name; do not choose day or time, do not distinguish directions; do not divide morning and evening; do not know prohibitions; this quickly brings down heaven’s blame. Can one not be cautious?’

Lin Boqian asked: ‘Pray how are commandments and precepts?’

The Patriarch said: ‘Ancient sages, because Dao learning is hard to enter, the world desires easy confusion; they established regulations and ceremonies to equalize the external appearance; annotations and methods to gather spirit and regulate the heart; refining qi and embryo source methods, controlling food and taste; also praying to true ones and paying thanks to wash away faults. Then proceed to learning. Those without learning reach to dark uncle, dwell in the house of diminishing and diminishing. Accord with non-action, then evil and deceit’s key is not opened, calm and pure harmony is attained. Hence the scriptures have three registers and seven types. The three registers are: first, Golden Register fasting, dispelling heavenly disasters, protecting and stabilizing king and country, used only by emperors. Second, Jade Register fasting, saving and delivering people, seeking blessings and confessing faults, used only by consorts, ministers, and officials. Third, Yellow Register fasting, saving life and delivering death, extracting from hell and the nine abysses of suffering, used by officials and commoners alike. The seven types are: first, Three Sovereigns fasting, seeking immortality and protecting country; second, Natural fasting, cultivating true learning and Dao; third, Supreme Clarity fasting, ascending void entering marvel; fourth, Guiding instruction fasting, warding off disaster and curing disease; fifth, Wretched fasting, repenting and seeking fate; sixth, Bright True fasting, extracting the nine abyss souls; seventh, Three Origins fasting, thanking Three Officers’ sins. These various fasts last one day and night, or three days and nights, or seven days and nights, all according to the ritual format. All have their basis. Therefore going out from Qian and entering Xun, all have incantations. Preserve the spirit’s thought true, and all thoughts have methods. Sometimes strike the ritual drum, sometimes think of the round image, sometimes send attendants to proclaim and communicate, always making clear their direction from which they come; sometimes request Supreme Highest True Vitality, always manifesting their entry point. Yet the Dao is in man’s heart; especially for memorials, if not deeply united, then only manifest according to affairs. The human heart has no substance; moved by situations; if situation is pure the heart is clear; if heart is clear the conduct is clean; if conduct is clean one can communicate with spirits; if heart is clear one can meet heaven’s Dao. Hence ascending altar to announce oath, yellow tablet to memorial, making heart and form both empty, man meets spirit joins. Heard it said: ten thousand volumes of pill books, not equal to holding one. I also say ten thousand ritual books, not equal to holding one. If one knows to hold one, then can follow the end and penetrate the root, follow the coarse and enter the fine; otherwise merely decorate the outside, make noise and finery, like children’s play; farther from Dao. How can one reach true and spirit?’

Lin Boqian asked: ‘How of offerings ceremony?’ The Patriarch said: ‘Anciently the way to communicate with spirits begins with sincerity; later sincerity is insufficient, so prepare objects as ceremony. If sincerity is genuine, and objects complete, still may be said; but objects not yet complete is greatest profanation. The scripture says: one may offer water and flowers; why need others? The scripture also says: images respect appearance; now all offerings are enough if without shame; otherwise all is profanation; must be cautious!’

The Ordaining Master said: ‘According to Jade Code Heavenly Articles, when setting festival, may not offer True One paper money; great profanation. Anciently even if there were netherworld utensils, no paper money; until Han end, there was paper money, using it to sacrifice ghosts and spirits of middle and lower realms, permissible. To offer it to heavenly true ones, is that proper? The worldly greedy though body passes through Taiyin, still one thought remains; as the Ten Thousand Lights Repentance says what is lacking is worldly wealth, therefore paper money’s transformation is to break that thought.’

Again said: ‘In ritual teaching is a section about lighting lamps; saying the Dipper moves in the central heaven, truly governing men’s fortune and misfortune, life and death authority; therefore urgent to report; no one unanswered. If able to arrange festival, then must follow secret festival method, or River Diagram festival method, as heart prays and blesses. Now some celebrate deity shrine’s birthday, and close lamps; some because of illness vow to close lamps; truly do not know the mystery of closing lamps.’

The Patriarch said: ‘Now the world transmits all knowing the name of the cave table, yet do not know why it is named thus. According to ancient system the table is decorated with vermilion, holding three cave treasures atop, hence called cave table. All related memorials are before the cave table. Now not so; only a table without vermilion decoration, this may be; offering writing all on it, this too may be. Worse placing various things atop, sometimes placing this for incense blessing, sometimes for memorial proclaiming, seeking to be near the imperial august one. But heaven is high and hears the low, no place unheard; to say to be near the imperial august one, do those memorials go unheard? How can one know the narrowness filling the void, the spirits densely gathered; if one thought arises, all three realms know; what distinction of far and near, high and low?’

Again said: ‘The first ritual in the festival commands water; this is to purge filth. Later generations hold it unchanging, till after three and nine meals, at festival’s start then purge water. If so, then during nine and three meals filth is not yet purged; can one meet true ones? If say images placed already, no filth; at festival start why purge water? From my view, at start of every affair purge water; then the situation is heart clear; heart clear then conduct clean; conduct clean then one can communicate with spirits; heart clear then can conform to heaven’s Dao. After purging water, then incense blessing, invite master to meet true, all in order.’

Purple Pot Xie Xiandao asked: ‘What is the great principle of Gang step?’

The Ordaining Master said: ‘You have heard the master say: Generally Gang steps use five steps to push conquest, stepping like cat and dog stalking snake; five steps forward, five steps back; seven forward seven back; four directions in accord with the five elements’ numbers; when snake crouches then strike. Look also at crouching mouse; likewise. Hence saying shaman’s step mostly of Yu, Yu’s step only five, able to combine five elements, long and high ascend. Like Eight Gates Escape, Taiyi Six Ren, Gu Xu methods, the main thing is Gang step. Also now men tread Kui and step Dipper; do they know great taboos exist? Also Scripture says: If you wish to ascend true, do not touch True Man; True Man is third star.’

Again said: ‘If you wish to summon spirit, do not block heaven’s gate. Heaven’s gate is Wenqu Star. All Dipper stepping methods must avoid breaking rules and violating order; such as steps crossing horizontally, called breaking rules; steps mistaken and stepping forward, called violating order. When breaking or violating happens, immediately bow to its star lord; this suffices.’

Purple Xie Zhao Mufu asked: ‘What now is called Yin Dipper and Yang Dipper?’

The Ordaining Master said: ‘Formerly heard from master: After winter solstice, beginning at Kui is Yang Dipper; after summer solstice, beginning at Bi is Yin Dipper. First step Yang Dipper then step Yin Dipper, called Fire and Water not yet combined; first step Yin Dipper then step Yang Dipper, called Water and Fire combined. Nowadays men begin with left foot at first star, counting Kui to Bi, called Yang Dipper; with right foot at first star, counting Tan to Po, called Yin Dipper. Mistake! Unfounded theory. The Scripture of Flying Spirits Visiting Dipper says: forward is Yang, backward is Yin; from Kui to Bi is forward; from Bi to Kui is backward. The main point says: If you wish to fly spirit, do not offend True Man, third star. Outside this all are Ding steps.’

Boqian asked: ‘There are five Laba festivals; what are they?’

The Patriarch said: ‘First month first day is Heavenly Laba; on this day the Five Emperors gather nine qi in the east blue sky; this is Heavenly Pengdu Yuanshen opening the great imperial palace. Fifth month fifth day is Earth Laba; on this day the Five Emperors gather three qi in southern red sky; this is Sudden Fire Decree great god entering Divine Firmament Jade Pure Court. Seventh month seventh day is Moral Laba; on this day the Five Emperors gather seven qi in western white sky; this is Heavenly You’s deputy marshal opening the Bright Spirit Court. Tenth month first day is People Year Laba; the Five Emperors gather five qi in northern dark sky; this is Yi Sheng great marshal opening Jingdan Heavenly Court. Twelfth month Laba day is Prince and Marquis Laba; on this day the Five Emperors gather myriad qi in upper dark capital jade capital; this is Xuanwu great marshal opening the Peaceful and Moving Court. These five days are days when the Five Emperors gather, the five gods open courts; these are the Five Laba.’

The Patriarch said: ‘You have heard this before! Han Lu Jia was the Jade Pure Yuanshi Master, chief immortal true man, leading Yellow Register affairs. Now Xin Hanchen is Thunder Capital official, Wolf Tooth fierce officer. Jin Tao Hongjing is Penglai Capital Water Office supervisor; Tang Chu Suiliang is Five Thunder messenger; Yan Zhenqing is Northern Pole Demon Driving Court left judge; Li Yangbing is Northern Pole Demon Driving Court right judge; Li Bai is East Flower Supreme Clarity monitor Qingyi True Man; Bai Letian is Penglai elder immortal chief. Also Jin female immortal Wei Huacun now Purple Void Yuangu, leading rank immortal duke; Tang female immortal Xie Ziran now Eastern Extreme True Man. Who are they? You should not neglect!’

Again said: ‘According to Divine Firmament Jade Code: Registers call the Original Fate True Man, meaning to practice the Zhengyi way, ordering oneself to cultivate one’s original fate, to obtain truth. How can common men take True Man as office title, openly misusing, even when reporting must examine oneself whether one practices True Man’s conduct; if not, writing True Man’s title is crime against nine ancestors, not forgiven by heaven. Only allowed to call bestowed great law registers, lower called law titles, not register titles; like common folk bestowed, called disciples.’

Xiandao asked: ‘Recently heard of Yuantong method, secretly doubted. Their method seal round inside, square outside; inside five elements, outside eight trigrams; provinces, bureaus, service, court arranged in four directions; with four characters Lingbao Yuantong as sect, and four characters Hunhua Xuanmi as root; within collecting various method talismans, charts, incantations, creating one school, called Great Yuantong Method. Does the true master approve?’ He said: ‘God has no square, hence round; qi has no body, hence flowing. Anciently Yuantong meant spirit qi mixed, entering and exiting void, returning to chaos. Now if take form, apparatus, trigrams and numbers as it, how far from true Yuantong!’

The Patriarch said: ‘Han Heavenly Master said: If man can keep six roots pure and clear, the heart and mind lucid; long practice, can sit to command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and rain. Now men who study the law do not base on Dao, do not follow the heart; men make themselves masters, families their own schools; making light and attaching to spirit possession as wonder, marking shadows and dreams as marvel; the generals they summon number hundreds and thousands; their restored law offices include true men, masters, and assistants; some mix shamanic secrets with true law; some use ghost and immortal descended writings and say secret transmission; if asked they say according to the code; if separated they hold it as true transmission. Ha! Heterodox masters err greatly, not fault of sentient beings; one blind leading many, confusing and spreading confusion. Alas!’

The Ordaining Master spoke with Purple Shaft regarding talisman water; said seekers are not all respectful and believing; some try and seek; I also tried to give, often no effect.

The Patriarch heard and said: ‘Do not take false to me while I take true; as to effect or no effect, that is another matter.’

The Patriarch again said: ‘Do not ask for spirit or not spirit; effect or no effect; casually use and depart; do not raise any thought.’

The Ordaining Master said to Boqian: ‘Your master’s place is Bi Zhi Peace; my place is Crane Forest Peace; your place now Purple Light Peace. Generally, those serving the law, their incense offering place must be petitioned to have a peace title. As Han Heavenly Master’s twenty-four places; anciently thirty-six peace abodes; Xu Jingyang’s seven peace places! Peace and places law says: civil houses are called peace, master houses called place.’

The Patriarch said: ‘To build altar and set festival is in essence one. Some say: Heaven has no floating shadow; four qi bright and clear; rivers and seas calm and silent; mountains swallow smoke; sun and moon do not move; the celestial orbs stop turning; above and below open; two instruments harmonize. At this time, myriad spirits and true ones meet. Therefore at festival memorial time, must desire such. But offering memorials and bowing to words, welcoming true and descending saints, meeting this heavenly colour, seems also to be effect. If say to rescue the dead and deliver souls must have rain then possible; if say to ward disaster and deliver calamity must have clear weather then possible. Thus all festivals and ceremonies accord with this.’

The Ordaining Master said to Xiandao: ‘I have heard the master say: Lao Dan has three treasures: one is compassion; two is frugality; three is not daring to be first in the world. Xu Jingyang has eight treasures: loyalty, filial piety, honesty, caution, generosity, tolerance, patience. Lü Dongbin has four treasures: unjust one; not greedy two; utmost sincerity three; guarding one four. Chen Nijiu has five treasures: wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, strictness. Many changes in affairs confound man, this is wisdom; focused and devoted, guarding one as usual, this is faith; helping men and benefiting things, forgiving in all matters, this is benevolence; resolute in dealing, heart firm and strong, this is courage; cautious not laughing or talking, serious and self-respecting, this is strictness. Eastern Barbarian Thunder is benevolent, able to bring wind and rain, nourishing all things. Southern Barbarian Thunder is brave, proclaiming orders, rewarding good and punishing evil. Western Barbarian Thunder is strict, killing primordial qi, thunder and lightning move all. Northern Barbarian Thunder is wise, concealing the Kan position, rising at time. Central Barbarian Thunder is faithful, lying in the four seasons, ordering not to rashly emit. This is the secret of heart transmission. True within is spirit; sincere outside no law.’

The Patriarch said: ‘A piece of wood a foot square placed on the earth, people step on it and have surplus; a piece of wood a chi square placed on the pole’s end, people stand on it but are not stable; not that thing has size, but heart has emptiness and fullness. Fierce tiger walks, grass and trees fall; poison viper angry, earth and stone upheave; because spirit is complete, then power is great; essence complete, then qi is strong. Shooting resembling tiger, see tiger but not stone; cutting violent flood dragon, but not see water; then at such time those who see with eyes do not see, those who hear with ears do not hear; this is by spirit using form’s Dao. Heart does not doubt hand; hand does not doubt brush; forget hand and brush then know writing’s way. To purge filth one must summon Five Emperors’ qi; to subdue snake must command Five Planets’ essence; if summon and command do not come, what use? Spirit is like mother; qi like child; spirit calls qi; mother calls child; how could they fail to come?’

The Ordaining Master said: ‘Former there was a high monk poem: A pool of lotus leaves, clothes endless; several pine trees yellow, food abundant; just known by men where he dwells; mountain monk today moves residence. Continued by cultivator of immortality, also a quatrain: Hungry eat tongue’s saliva and still full; cold hair cinnabar field fire then warm; naturally has with him poor livelihood; better seek me not seek others. Such two poems may somewhat reduce the body and mouth’s turbid schemes.’

The Patriarch said: ‘Those who cultivate truth, sincerely set their resolve, endure hardship to act, concentrate thought to reach effect, forget self to join truth. If able thus, scripture says: universe is in the hand; myriad transformations in the body. Again says: if man can always be clear and quiet, heaven and earth all return. The world may not know this; able in noise to find stillness, in turbidness to find clarity; make equal view; all thoughts finished; motion without obstruction; gain great peace and joy; this is called Dao. If not so, gazing at stars and worshipping Dipper may also do; chanting scriptures and incantations may also do; I know not.’

Again said: ‘I have heard former masters say: Ancient immortals and sages passed mouth to mouth without establishing writing. Now in the world, writing and recording; those who gain enlightenment can transmit sacred Dao; those without enlightenment have none; those enlightened gain it themselves. Gaining enlightenment sacred Dao has no ancient or now. Its going is not ancient; its coming not now; what can be transmitted is called matter, not Dao. Dao originally has no transmission; Dao has no sound or colour; Dao has no form; Dao has no ancient or now; Dao has no coming or going.’

Again said: ‘Practicing law is like being an official; cultivating Dao is like hiding and retiring.’

Again said: ‘A guest came and asked about Twelve Officers; so I instructed: Heavenly Gang belongs to Chen, Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei, called the Four Uprights because they belong to earth, dwelling centrally; hence called Four Uprights. Gang character composed of four and upright; Chen is earth, thus this officer called Heavenly Gang. Taiyi belongs to Si, Si is Thunder Gate, also called Wind Gate; Water Mouth is also Nine Heavens Taiyi Ten Gods’ place; thus this officer called Taiyi. Shengguang belongs to Wu; Wu is Li brightness; not originally Shengguang, but Tengguang. Xiaoji belongs to Wei; Daji belongs to Chou; both are noble gods of heaven. Jia, Wu, Geng are heaven’s three wonders; cattle and sheep are noble; thus Daji and Xiaoji both noble gods. Transmitting belongs to Shen; Shen is Kun; Kun is earth door; earth door is cloud; cloud meets sky; hence called Transmitting belonging to Kui, belonging to You. Character 'cong' is departing tone; cong means follow; because beside Xu and Kui, hence said to follow Kui. He Kui belongs to Xu; Xu and Hai are river source; Xu is heavenly river; hence this Kui god named River Kui. Dengming belongs to Hai; Hai is heaven gate. Shenhou belongs to Zi; Zi belongs to Kan; Kan is Yin queen; Tianhou called Shenhou. Yin is officer; Yin is Gen; Kun and Gen both earth; Gen is mountain; Kun is earth; mountain and marsh communicate qi; hence Gen and Kun are cloud gathering; thus Yin and Shen are officer and transmitter gods. Dachong belongs to Mao; Mao is thunder; thunder god called Tianchong. The Scripture of Delivering Men says: throwing fire ten thousand li, electric flash; flowing bell eight clash thunder. Though these are twelve officers, truly the Emperor’s right arm and leg’s help.’

## The Recorded Sayings of the Perfected One Hai Qiongbai, Volume the Third

Recorded by Disciples Yan Hu and Ye Guxi and others  
### Ascending the Hall at Wuyi  
This one incense petal, before chaos was divided, first bud, new branch and leaf of Dragon River New Origin. Without Yin and Yang, earth dragons coil and tigers crouch; receiving heaven and earth’s outer rain and wind’s blowing. On Kunlun Mountain medicine does not flower; beside splendid pond trees cast no shadow. Thick smoke has no colour, pervades the Supreme Pure’s top gate; auspicious mist soundless, transforms into primordial nostrils. Holding it up makes demons and devils’ courage shatter; burning it makes the wind and music move. Only then understand Shakyamuni personally planted it; Confucius took it without intent; all great ultimate undivided qi; the root of empty deathlessness. Heat toward the furnace, respectfully for former saints and former masters, utter words and breathe out breath. Bless one man with good fortune; all ten thousand countries peaceful; the six palaces complete cultivation; all officials timely. All heaven and earth are great Luo saintly realms; all mountains and rivers form mysterious capitals and jade cities. No one studying Dao and true man knows the constant noble scholar; doubts not yet resolved; wisdom locked unopened; all saints and sages look with one eye; wise and foolish open the thirty tongues to question. So-called array three mysterious spear armor, set eight extreme bows and spears; seeing righteousness yet not doing, where is courage!’

Tian Gu asked: ‘The great Dao has no name; why then have lead and mercury?’ The Master answered: ‘To manifest the invisible form is the Dao’s dragon and tiger; to reveal the nameless name is the Dao’s lead and mercury.’ Asked again: ‘Within the five metals, silver is extracted from lead; among eight stones, mercury is extracted from sand. How to cultivate the inner pill?’ Answered: ‘Silver in lead, mercury in sand; within the body the heart yin and inner yang.’

Xue Yan asked: ‘Medicines have floating and sinking, clear and turbid; fire degree has pulling adding advancing and retreating; use is host and guest; flourishing and declining in punishment and virtue. How is this principle?’ The Master answered: ‘All day gathering great medicines, where to distinguish floating and sinking? All day practicing fire degree, who knows advancing and retreating? Five elements all present without production and conquest; four images harmonize times not host or guest.’

Asked again: ‘Front string and rear string, metal number and water number; two eight six is one jin; where to gather medicine? Where to cook and refine?’ Answered: ‘Front string metal number, rear string water number; gather one jin, cook one jin.’

Xi Weng asked: ‘Master points to what is taught is originally great Dao; disciples transmit again and learn Golden Pill. Not clear if great Dao and Golden Pill are same or separate?’ The Master answered: ‘Cross river must have raft; arriving shore no need for boat.’

Asked: ‘Golden Pill learning depends on medicine as first; medicine use depends on fire degree as chief; what is medicine? What is fire degree?’ Answered: ‘Medicine is yang within yin; fire degree yin within yang; understand yin and yang’s intent; great medicine in one place explained.’

Gu An asked: ‘True lead true mercury, true tiger true dragon; what are these things? Ding Gong, Huang Po, infant bride and groom; what use are these?’ The Master answered: ‘Understand originally three two one; do not rely on former one two three.’

Asked: ‘Lead belongs to north; why then metal lead? Mercury belongs to south; why then wood mercury?’ Answered: ‘Women wear green clothes; gentlemen drape white silk.’

Xiao Quan asked: ‘Dragon roars, tiger howls, not at mouth and nose; man sings woman follows, not in heart and kidney. Mercury not Li; lead not Kan; Dui not tiger; Zhen not dragon. Lost in confusion; wish to seek pill formula.’ The Master answered: ‘Kan Li blend thought heart and kidney; do not seek lung and liver in Zhen Dui; understand yin and yang two words; naturally husband and wife tiger and dragon coil.’

Asked: ‘Spittle, essence saliva, qi blood fluid; Zhongli says belong to yin; saliva essence blood brain qi spirit; Wang
